About the SymbolicData Project

    The SymbolicData project is set out to develop concepts and tools
for testing Computer Algebra Software (CAS) and to collect relevant
data from different areas of Computer Algebra. Tools and data are
designed to be used both on a local site for special testing purposes
and to manage a central repository at www.symbolicdata.org.

    SymbolicData tools and data are available for download under the
terms of the GNU Public License.

...

Motivation for the SymbolicData Project

For different purposes algorithms and implementations are tested on
certified and reliable data. The development of tools and data for
such tests is usually "orthogonal" to the main implementational
efforts, it requires different skills and technologies and is not
loved by programmers. On the other hand, in many cases tools and data
could easily be reused - with slight modifications - across similar
projects. The SymbolicData Project is set out to coordinate such
efforts within the Computer Algebra Community.

Bill Page.
