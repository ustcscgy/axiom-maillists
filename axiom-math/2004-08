Hello friends,

I have a kind of philosophical problem concerning the notion of algebra
vs. sigma-algebra in the context of AXIOM. An algebra on a set S is, roughly
spoken, defined as a family of subsets stable under finitly many set
operations.
A sigma-algebra on S is, roughly spoken again, defined as a family of subsets
stable under any countable collection of set operations.

Aren't both of these definitions the same in the context of representation in
AXIOM or any other CAS? Aren't sets in a CAS not countable in ANY case?

This problem employs me during the last days and I can't find a satifying
solution...

Thanks for your attention,
Wolfgang

I'm reading "Hackers & Painters" by Paul Graham and pondering some
of his comments in relation to Axiom. 

Chapter 11 is about "The Hundred-Year Language". I've been aiming
Axiom at the "30 Year Horizon", which you've all heard from me before
so it's obvious why Paul's notion appeals to me. 

Paul makes the comment that programs are just notation and that we
ought to give thought to the idea of "designing" the notation so that
it says the things we want to say in an elegant way. In particular,
Axiom's notation is much closer to mathematics than most other notations.

Axiom, being basically mathematics, could use a large dose of this 
advice. Historically math has made progress based on notations (e.g.
0, dx/dy, matrices). At present the best we seem to strive for is to
mimic standard math notation on output as closely as possible.

However, I've been scratching at a more general idea that could be
explored in Axiom. Axiom adds some ideas new, novel, and unique in
mathematics which we have not recognized notationally. For example,
the idea of "process", the idea of "functors", or "provisos".

We have been limiting the idea of "process" to represent traditional
mathematical functions. We tend to adopt the notation f(x)=

However, one of the ideas we're pondering (indefinites) seems to me
to need a new notation. It is clear that one way to think about an
indefinite integer, for example, is as a loop. So, as Fateman pointed
out, we might want to raise a matrix M to an indefinite power N. This
could be expressed as 
  (let (X=I) for i in 1..N do X=X*M)

This is a procedural, semi-function, way of thinking about the solution.
We do not yet have a decent notation for a process. Such a notation
would be as valuable as the leap from summation to integration. It would
allow the "30 year horizon computational mathematician" to write process
objects, compute functions over processes as well as processes over
functions (which we now do). 

It might be time to consider a notation using distinct marks chosen
from a non-mathematical alphabet (such as a pictographic language
like chinese or japanese) to represent the new ideas.

Notation is a way to encapsulate thought. I think Axiom needs to 
pioneer a notation to encapsulate the ideas it presents (functors,
for instance) cleanly so we use mathematics (operators, proofs, 
state spaces, mappings) to think, compute, and communicate the ideas 
clearly.

Obviously I'm not the first to think of this issue so I'm musing in
public with the hope of getting references. I'll collect what I
can and set up a webpage devoted to the sources if there is enough
of a response.

I don't have any profound insights as far as notation, but I would
suggest a particular documentation approach to this type of work.

Mathematical notation is implimented (or at least based on) standard
mathematical ideas because they are intuitive to the normal mathematics
user.  Unique notation, however useful or powerful it might be, will be
rejected by all but a few unless two things happen:

1)  The notation becomes a standard way of doing something useful in a
computer algebra system
2)  End users are compelled to learn the notation because they can't
live without the extra expressiveness/features/etc. it provides.

1) is wrapped up in 2), in my opinion.  And the only way to get a foot
in the door with 2) is to a) document the new notation comprehensively,
clearly, and usably and b) provide non-trivial useful examples where
the new notation solves a problem where old notation would have had
great difficulties.  We have to sell the new notation, not just develop
it.  We have to make people want it.

The tool that comes to mind as an effectively marketed tool is Sun's
new system tool dtrace.  Their strategy was simple but very effective -
they showed useful examples where subtle system problems were
identified by dtrace quickly where no other system tools could have
done it nearly as well.  I think any new notation Axiom is going to
introduce will have to do the same - not just propose it and show it is
elegant, but have cases of it effectively addressing real world (or at
least math world) problems.  Show people that it is worth the time and
pain to learn new concepts and tools.  Then, if people like the new
abilities well enough, perhaps a standard can be created.

I would also suggest this be the figure of merit for proposed new
notation - not only that it be powerful in theory, but shown to be
powerful in interesting examples.  Just my 2c.

Hm, what's wrong with the current notation "f(x)=" ? Axiom does allow you to
define, for example

^(x, n)==reduce(*, [x for i in 1..n])

and use it as you would use any other function:

matrix([[0,1],[1,0]]) ^ 2.

What could be more decent?

Yes, "Indefinite Integers" are missing, but we do have good notation (and
representation for "procedural" functions)

Do I miss something?

Martin

Actually Axiom and its programming language do make programs much
shorter. It closely mirrors the mathematics and uses a unification
of the idea of categories from math with the idea of type hierarchy
from comp sci to get very expressive, short programs. Most functions
are less than 10 lines long and on average are below that length. The
resulting algorithms are extremely readable (provided you know the
theory, of course).

It's not the length of the program that I'm trying to optimize but
the length of the thought process. Imagine having to say "take the
limit of this function as x tends toward zero such that given any
epsilon we can always find a delta... We don't do this. We just say
integrate and we just write the \int symbol.

The problem that needs to be attacked, however, is that there doesn't
appear to be a notation that I could write by hand for a "thing" that
has the properties of a program (including the notion of process) as
well as the properties of a mathematical object. (Or the "thing" that
has the properties of a closure as well as a mathematical object).



Let me try an example. Consider the simple case of trying to raise a
square matrix to an integer power:
 
 P = 3
 M:SquareMatrix(2) = matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 M^P

which we know how to do. 



The harder case is to assume we don't know the actual value of P but
we know its Category. So if an IndefiniteInteger which have the
property of integers but we don't say which one. IndefiniteInteger is
a type we understand so we can say:

 P = IndefiniteInteger()
 M = SquareMatrix(2)
 M^P

which implies that we have to compute a symbolic object (M^P) but know
that P is of some well-defined type with certain properties but with
unspecified value. We can't compute it's actual value until P takes on
a particular integer value.



The notational case is even harder. So I'd like to be able
to say:

 P = Program(foo)
 M:SquareMatrix(2) = matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 M^P

but first I need to define categorical properties of the "Program"
type. So it might be a functor of the form:

 Program(C:Code) -> Integer()

that is, a Program type is Categorically defined to accept things
of type Code and is guaranteed to produce an Integer(). Notice
what happened here. I'm trying to raise a square matrix to an
unspecified power and all I can guarantee is that the operation
WOULD be defined if I were to compute it. I want a name for this
concept "the operation would be defined if we run it". 

Now mathematically this is hard because we haven't defined the
Category structure for Code. Do we require all Code functions to be
total (a definite valid value for every input?). Do we require the
Category of Stateless so that the function always returns the same
result? If so, we could functionally compose Program types, define
operators, and be able to compute:

  Q = P*P

where the '*' function is
 
  *(Program,Program) -> Program

However, Program objects could include the notion of "running" over
time (unless you subscribe to Dijkstra's view). There is some previous
work in this area in lisp (scheme has continuations, lisp has closure, 
delay and force). I'd like to distinguish these "special property" 
objects with a new mathematical notation so they become apparent.

Thus, a polynomial that uses P above is not obviously "runnable" if
we just create a program variable and use it in the polynomial:

 p = Program(knarlyfunction)
 poly = p^2 + 2*p + 1

'poly' has a value that  now depends on {running, forcing, continuing} p.




I'm suggesting that we need to have a "run, force, continue" notation
similar to integration, with integration we normally write:

 integrate(poly,p)

to integrate poly with respect to p. With programs we could say

 force(poly)

where 'force' is a fancy looking kanji character on input and output.
The reason for choosing a fancy character is to "lift" the idea of
forcing functions into the notation so we can start defining the 
difference between

  force( integrate(poly,p) )

and 

  integrate( force(poly) , p)

or even

 force( force(poly) )

where 'force' means "the operation would be defined if we run it".



This raising the question of how this new notational idea composes with
other notations. What does kanji-F (force) mean and what are its
properties?
 



Indeed, some mathematical problems lend themselves well to such a
notation. Consider a function that, when integrated, returns multiple
branches. This could be handled by continuations. So in the computatation

                                | x<0 => sin(x)
                                |
  integrate(knarlyfunction,x) =>| x=0 => 0
                                |
                                | x>0 => cos(x)

consider what could happen. Somewhere in the integration it 
becomes apparent that, say, the result is discontinuous at 0.
The code breaks the computation into 3 delayed branches (or
continuations, or closures, or whatever) and returns these
continuations unforced.

  kanji-C1 = Program(knarlyfunction, proviso(x<0))
  kanji-C2 = Program(knarlyfunction, proviso(x=0))
  kanji-C3 = Program(knarlyfunction, proviso(x>0))

so kanji-C1 is a closure objects that can return a result. 
and then does 

  force(kanji-C1)
  force(kanji-C2)
  force(kanji-C3)


Consider what happens if we think about this notationally rather
than computationally. We could state that 

  integrate(knarlyfunction,x) => {kanji-C1, kanji-C2, kanji-C3}

and leave the results as symbolic values rather than forcing them.
Since we are building symbolic mathematical software this is a 
ideally what we'd like to be able to do. Then we could evaluate
a polynomial thus:

  poly = x^2 + 2*x + 3
  eval(poly, x==kanji-C1) 

and get the result

  kanji-C4

and force(kanji-C4) => sin(x)&2 + 2*sin(x) + 3



The overall thought is that if we have a notation that will allow
us to write results using pencil-and-paper then we can begin to
express what these things mean in a computational mathematics system.

Currently we're using the ideas but we haven't reified them.

Sorry, but I still do not understand. In fact, I don't see the need for such a
notation. I'd say that "programs" are just "mathematical objects"... After all,
a polynomial for example, or better, the cosine is definitely a mathematical
object, but it's also a "program".

Well, we do not yet have reached a conclusion what an IndefiniteInteger should
be, do we? There is the possibility described by Davenport and Faure, and
certainly there are others. In the above I also have trouble determining the
type of M^P. I don't think you meant to have an exponentiation of domains? So
it should probably read

 P : IndefiniteInteger()
 M : SquareMatrix(2) = matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
 M^P

or

 P : IndefiniteInteger()
 M : IndefiniteSquareMatrix(2)
 M^P

or something like that. I'm not sure whether we want to modify the domain
SquareMatrix to allow for exponentiation with an IndefiniteInteger, but on the
other hand, why not? The result would be an IndefiniteSquareMatrix (or the zero
matrix or the identity -- oops, bug report on the way), that's for sure...

What do you mean by that? Is M^P a program, that evaluates to a
SquareMatrix(2)? I don't think that there is a notational problem here.
I don't really know whether an operator that delays execution of a program
would be useful. Its consequences for the type-system are -- I admit -- not
easy to foresee. However, I have the feeling that we do not have the userbase
yet to explore these fields. I have the feeling, that it disperses our "energy"
a little, however.

I think it would be good to continue the discussion on indefinite things, but
one such topic is enough -- for me at least. One suggestion: could we have a
wishlist on the savannah website? Maybe registered users could even vote for
priorities there?

All the best,

Martin

I don't know if Bill Naylor subscribes to this list, but his PhD (at
Bath, supervised by James Davenport) involved using straight-line
programs to represent polynomials in Axiom.  Just as with other
mathematical objects you could do arithmetic with them, perform
operations such as GCD computations etc., however their representation
was as an explicit program.  These programs were represented in Axiom as
instances of domains in the usual way - if I remember rightly the
infrastructure he created was quite extensive.  I don't know if this
work really addresses Tim's original thoughts about notation which
started off this thread but it might be worth looking at or even
reviving.  

Mike.

Such a wish list is a good idea. Rather than have it centrally maintained,
however, why don't we try collaborating on it? Given Bill Page's wiki
technology it is possible for you to create a wish list web page on the
Axiom wiki site. Visit http://page.axiom-developer.org

Btw, I've incorporated most of your changes. I'm documenting and testing
them for potential breakage.

Tim, Mike, et al.

Here is Bill Naylor's web site:

  http://www.scl.csd.uwo.ca/~bill/

I think it would be very interesting to resurrect these
ideas on "Straight Line Programs"!

Actually Bill left ORCCA more than two years ago and after teaching in
New Zealand is back at Bath working on Web Services.  His current home
page is http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~wn which I see includes his PhD thesis
and the accompanying software.

Cheers, Mike.

Well you can check out my thesis from my web site if you like:

http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/~wn/thesis.ps.gz

there is also a tar file of some of the code I wrote as well (can't 
remember if it works though!!),

cheers,

Bill

This reminds me of Multi-Stage Programming, where we construct programs that

Bill,

I've been reading through your thesis and it's excellent. I've also
downloaded the program sources which all appear to be in aldor.  I'd
like your permission to bring the thesis work back to life on the
current Axiom and use the thesis to explain the work as a literate
program. I'll have to rewrite portions of the CCL and the Aldor
sections to bring them in line with the current level. Also, Axiom now
contains a "pamphlet" (basically tex with a few extras) structure
which allows code to be embedded "inline" in the document as part of
the explanation. This is useful for making code maintainable in future
releases.

I don't see any makefiles with the code. Is there an input file that
was used to build these?

yes, they all include the file axiom.as, so that they have to be run under 
the axiom environment. I wrote them in aldor because I believed that was 
the way axiom would be heading.

sure, no problem.

Is this anything todo with Manuel Bronsteins aldorlib?

Unforunatly not, whenever I wrote a new bit of code, I just compiled it 
from the command line!

The CVS now has the build process for GCL-2.6.5.
This fixes the sqrt(2.) bug.

Postdoc Position in the Frame of the Theorema Project
======================================================

The new Radon Institute for Computational and Applied Mathematics
(RICAM) of the Austrian Academy of Science in Linz, Austria, offers a
postdoc position in the frame of the Theorema Project.

The Theorema Project aims at creating a system that supports the
entire process of Mathematical Theory Exploration (inventing
