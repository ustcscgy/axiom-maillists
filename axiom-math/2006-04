I made many computations and I am quite satisfied with the results.
I had no difficult to modify the functions defined on the wiki page to 
change the settings (variable number, minimal polinomial). About this, I 
have just a couple of simple questions:

1) Is it possible to define the functions so that the number of variable 
is itself a variable and the function generates "on the fly" the required 
variables (all with the same minimal polinomial)? I am meaning the 
following: instead of
newpoly(t:H):H
I would like to define
newpoly(t:H,n:INT):H
so that t is a polinomial in the variables x_1,...,x_n the relations are, 
for example, x_i^2=ax_i+b for each i.
So, we should generate the array of the variables, then an array with all 
the relations and then we should try div for each relation in this last 
array...

I am asking this beacuse I had to make may examples changing the number of 
variables and I had to rewrite the same file each time with minor 
(and uniform) changes.

2) Is it possible to get rid of all the declarations ::V in 
p1:=(x::V+y::V)$H^2  ?

I want to add a remark: as noted on the wiki, the reduction should be 
carried over as many time as possible, so I use the auxiliary function

reduce(p:H):H ==
  p2 := newpoly(p)
  p3 := newpoly(p2)
  while p3 ~= p2 repeat
   p2 := p3
   p3 := newpoly(p2)
  p3

Now, if you try to reduce the successive powers of x+y, the functions 
slows down very quicly and you can't go further than (x+y)^10 or little 
more. In this particular case, it is much more efficient to do it 
in the following way:

power(q:H,n:INT):H ==
   qq:H:=1
   for i in 1..n repeat
    qq:=reduce(qq*q)
   qq

This way, I have no difficulties in calculating (x+y)^100 or even much 
more. Is there another way to obtain this same efficency?


All of this is, anyway, simply a matter of making working better what 
already is done.
I also have another problem, more important to me.

The above setting is:
Q=FRAC INT
K=Q(a,b)
H=K[x,y]

with relations

xyx=yxy
xx=ax+b
yy=ay+b

I would like to write the element
s=1+x+y+xy+yx+xyx
of H like a polinomial in u=x+y

In mathematics, if I is the ideal
I=(xyx-yxy,xx-ax-b,yy-ay-b) and L=H/I,
then I would like to see if s belongs to the subring L[u].

I guess that one way should be to use Groebner basis, but H is 
noncommutative. Is there a noncommutative groebner basis package in axiom?

In any case, it is not exactly this: I do not want to see if s belongs to 
I, but I want to write it as a polynomial in u.

Thank you and best regards

Fabio

I said that symbolic computation was ok, but making more and more examples
I found some problem.

I refer to

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxNoncommutativePolynomials

with notations

Q=FRAC INT
K=Q(a,b)
H=K[x,y]


Now I use relations of degree 3 for x and y, namely:

yxy=xyx
x^3=ax^2+bx+c
y^3=ax^2+by+c

Accordingly, I modified the core function subs to

subs(w:M):H ==
   -- y*x*y=x*y*x
   n:=div(w,(y::V*x::V*y::V)$M)$M
   n case ok => monom(n.ok.lm,1)$H * (x::V*y::V*x::V)$H * monom(n.ok.rm,1)$H
   -- x*x*x=a*x*x+b*x+c
   n:=div(w,(x::V^3)$M)$M
   n case ok => monom(n.ok.lm,1)$H * (a::K*(x::V)^2+b::K*x::V+c::K)$H * monom(n.ok.rm,1)$H
   -- y*y*y=a*y*y+b*y+c
   n:=div(w,(y::V^3)$M)$M
   n case ok => monom(n.ok.lm,1)$H * (a::K*y::V*y::V+b::K*y::V+c::K)$H * monom(n.ok.rm,1)$H
   -- no change
   monom(w,1)$H

and I use the auxilliary function

reduce(p:H):H ==
   p2 := newpoly(p)
   p3 := newpoly(p2)
   while p3 ~= p2 repeat
    p2 := p3
    p3 := newpoly(p2)
   p3

The problem is that not every monomial gets reduced to its "lowest degree"
form. Take, for example,
w=xxyxxyx

you get

reduce(w)=w

and this happens because it doesn't contain any yxy,xxx,yyy. On the other
hand, it DOES reduce:

xxyxxyx
     ---
xxyxyxy
   ---
xxxyxxy

and so now a x^3 appears, which can be reduced.

Adding the relation for xyx=yxy doesn't help: you go in loop in many
cases. So, how to handle this kind of problem?


Thanks again

Fabio

PS: I tried to add this to the relative sandbox page, but I have not been 
able: I added the "reduce" function, but it complains that H is not a 
valid type. That is, it doesn't load automatically all the previous 
definition. How do I get this?

Is there a function to compute the minimal polynomial of a matrix? I 
looked on all the docs I have and on the wiki, but I couldn't find any 
such function.


Thanks

Hello,=20

How can I convert an expression as sin (%pi/5) to a float ?

I can use sin (%pi/5) + 0.0, but I find it's a dirty tick !

(sin (%pi/5))::Float doesn't work.

I refuse to go inside the formula and type : sin (%pi/5::Float).

Is there an other ability ?

Since the error message is:

"Cannot convert from type Expression Integer to Float"

one might guess to use:

  (sin (%pi/5))::Expression Float

and that would be right although the result is 'Expression Float'.
If you really want/need float you can write:

  (sin (%pi/5))::Expression Float::Float

Hello friends of Axiom,

I'd like to invite you to improve Axiom's website

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/

There is already quite a lot of information available, but it is perhaps 
not in a form that suits best the need of its users.

As you all know anyone can edit these pages and can improve them. Yes, 
also YOU can. But if you don't yet feel like editing pages in public, 
simply reply to that mail and tell us all what you like and dislike there.
(1) Which information should be more easily accessible?
(2) Which information you are constantly missing?
(3) Is the FrontPage good enough? Does it contain too much/too few 
information?
(4) What questions should be added to the FAQ page? (If you can manage, 
immediately enter your question there. Simply press the _edit_ link in 
the top right corner, enter your question and press SAVE.)
(5) ...

Please help. A better AXIOM depends on YOU.

Hope to hear from you

Ralf Hemmecke

Hi,

  While I was "spring cleaning" my computers, I found this

    http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david/categories/book/book.pdf

which I believe might be of reading interest to the Axiom community.

Thank you very much for the reference! This book called:

  Computational Category Theory

was published by Prentice Hall in 1988.

Yes indeed I do find this of very great interest and relavance
to Axiom. This is *exactly* the kind of computational category
theory that I would like to do with Axiom. This book provides
a complete blueprint for doing exactly this although the
programming language used by the authors David Rydeheard,
University of Manchester

http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~david
http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/fmethods/people/der/der.html

and R.M. Burstall, University of Edinburgh, is in fact ML.

The ML programs are available here:

Bill Page.
