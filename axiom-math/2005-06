Dear Martin:

I try your functions with the sequences:

A: 1, 9, 113, 1711, 28729, 514615

B: 1, 9,  49,  271,  1613,  10013

C: 1, 9, 113, 1719, 28981, 521103

D: 1, 9,  49,  279,  1793,  12441


but each of the functions returned an empty list. (The sequences seem not to be
in Sloane library; they are not arbitrary and count the number of some binary
trees; and the next term will take a few days to compute by brute force). Any
help will be much appreciated. 

William

Manuel Bronstein died this week of a heart attack at age 42.
Manuel leaves behind Karola (his wife) and six children. 

I just returned from a house-hunting trip in Pittsburgh 
to hear this terrible news.

I worked with him at IBM Research and have maintained contact
with him since that time. In fact, he got me to volunteer for
another ACM/ISSAC CD project just last week.

Manuel was one of the fundamental people on the Axiom project.
He's given us permission to use his PhD thesis as documentation
for the integration routines. He has contributed quite a bit of
effort behind the scenes through personal communication with me.

Manuel was one of the key computational mathematicians of our time.
He had a major impact on the organization and implementation of the
Axiom library which will be a useful legacy for future generations.
He should have had 40 more years enrich us all.

More importantly, Manuel was a good person and a friend. We spent
much time together talking about and flying airplanes. I have a
set of pictures he sent me from his soaring trips in the Alps and
fond memories of our flying trips along the Hudson River in NY.

I'd like to figure out some way to mark his passing. At minimum
I believe we should include his obituary in the ISSAC proceedings.
If there are any other efforts or suggestions please contact me 
so I can help.

In sadness,
Tim Daly

17 June 2005

Some time ago, I managed to get axiom running under suse linux 7.2 (graphics 
not working). Recently I downloaded the latest version and got it running 
under suse linux 9.2 (with working graphics) on another machine.

I am trying to convert some of my Matlab m-files to axiom. Any
assistance with the following will be much appreciated:


(1) Is there a short way of declaring all variables in an axiom 
    function to be local ?

    In Matlab this is automatically the case and global variables have
    to be specifically declared. 

    In axiom it seems that its the opposite, creating the possibility
    of errors. Is this a design error in an otherwise very
    advanced language ?

(2) In Matlab I have a main function (in an m-file) calling another
    function, which in turn calls another function etc. Its not clear
    from the axiom book how to implement this. Does one have to use
    )read fun1.input, )read fun2.input, ...etc, and then fun1(); ?

    Any papers, reports or tutorials on the details of axiom programming
    involving multiple functions defined in separate files, calling
    each other, etc as described above would be helpful.

(3) Is there a setting in axiom to avoid having to use underscore _,
    to insert blank lines between program lines in files defining
    functions ? This seems awkward and error prone.

(4) I am using the Matlab symbolic toolbox (Maple engine). Its not
    clear from the axiom book how to typecast a unit matrix (integer
    or float) to type expression or variable in order to add it to
    another matrix containing expressions in the variable/symbol x,
    for example: A:= I + matrixins;

(5) System commands like )read, etc don't seem to work within
    functions ?

(6) Is there an axiom equivalent to Matlab's pause command ?

(7) I tried using a list to return  multiple variables from a
    function. However, this turns out to be of type any. These variables 
    can be displayed but not used in operations any further. This means
    that you have to remember the types of each variable in the list.
    Then, manually in the calling function extract and explicitly
    typecast each variable in the returned list. Is there an easier
    way of doing this ??

(8) Does the current axiom distribution with working graphics have to
    be recompiled on my older suse linux 7.2 machine (first one took 
    about 12 hours) or can I somehow copy the directory of the latest
    axiom via ethernet from  my newer suse linux 9.2 machine ?
    
Regards,

C. Frangos.

May be this can help,
if it's not "mathematically correct", use data stucture operation,
(TwoDimensionalArray), in other words, you have to coerce yourself
matrix(INT) for example to Matrix(POLY INT))

great!

even better!

If you compile your files, this is automatically the case. However, it seems
that you want to use .input files, not .spad files?

Thinking about it, it should be automatically the case in .input files,
too. Could you send an example?

Mostly the same in Axiom. See section 6.16 of the Axiom Book.

No, functions can call each other within on input file.

See below. I'll include my latest input file that deals with garch processes.

You don't have to do this usually. Only if you want to continue a line.

Don't do this. You want to use the + from MATRIX INT, for example.

m1 := [[1,2],[3,4]]
m2 := [[x,y],[u,v]]

m1+m2 should add the two without complaining

No.

Don't know.

They shouldn't be converted to type ANY. Often it helps to declare your
functions. See below.

Yes, that should work. (If the paths are the same...)

Here comes a .input from my research.

epsilon contains a garch process after you said

)re garch.input

from within axiom


Hope this helps a little bit. I'll try to detail (2) coming monday.

When you say "axiom function" I suppose you mean
defining functions in the Axiom interpreter. The
Axiom interpreter is really intended primarily for
online interactive use.

If you are converting a lot of Matlab code I think
you would be much better advised to write Axiom
library packages and/or new domains.

No. )read only instructions the interpret to get it's input
from a file instead of from the console.

Calling functions in Axiom is done the same way as
in most other high level languages except that Axiom's
programming language (library compiler) permits simple
overloading of function names based on types. So for
example a function named 'average' may do quite different
things if is applied to matrix compared to a list etc.

I highly recommend reading the Chapter 11 Packages in the
Axiom Book.

This is an artifact of trying to use the Axiom interpreter
environment for programming. _ is not required in .input
files read by )read nor is is used in Axiom library
programming.

I am not sure what you mean, but this works for me for example

  1> A:=matrix [[x,y],[z,w]]
  2> A+1

See

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/SandboxMatrix

It is not clear to me why you want to do this.

I don't think so. Probably a call to a simple lisp function
could do this.

Axiom remembers the actual type. Try this

  1> f() = [x,"x",1]
  2> f().1 + 1
  3> concat(f().2,"y")
  4> f().3 + 1

You might have problems with incompatible versions of system
librarys if you try to copy Axiom compiled on a newer
version of suse to an older one. You might be able to just
do

  cvs update
  ./configure
  (set variables)
  make

on your old system. In principle this *might* not require
a complete rebuild of Axiom.

Bill Page.

As I've mentioned on these mailing lists before, the Axiom 
community lost another major contributor. Like Dick Jenks,
Manuel Bronstein was one of the key developers of the original
Axiom system. He was also active with me behind the scenes,
has contributed his thesis work for documentatin purposes,
and has done large pieces of software (SUMit and  as a
supervisor for Niklaus Mannhart, PIit, plus an integrator
for Maple).

There have been several emails crossing my desk about Manuel
but this one I want to share with you mostly out of concern
for his family. Manuel leaves behind a wife and 6 children.

Hello, everyone,

Manuel's brother Yonah relays some unfortunate news.  Manuel did not
have life insurance, and his family needs financial help.  See below.

I replied asking him to provide bank account information for people
outside the US who might want to make transfers.  When I get that
information, I'll send out a broader announcement.  I also asked if he
needs help finding people to sort through Manuel's scientific papers.

FYI: the organization Yonah refers to is an orthodox Lubavitcher

Dear Mr. Volcheck,

This is Yonah Alexandre Bronstein, Manuel's brother, helping Tamara with her
emails. I came in to help bury Manu and help Tamara deal with the aftermath of
his death.

If you can forgive me for being practical, Manuel unfortunately passed away
without life insurance (he was in between 2 contracts), and so now Tamara and
her 6 kids face some financial difficulties as well.

I have therefore organized a support fund for Manuel's family, based in
California (where I live and will be able to help manage it). Those who want to
help can send checks:
.to the order of: CHABAD
.mention: "MANUEL BRONSTEIN FAMILY FUND"
.address:
CHABAD
3070 LOUIS ROAD
PALO ALTO, CA 94303
USA

I'd be most grateful if you could diffuse that information as you feel is
appropriate, through the ACM and other professional organizations who knew
Manuel.

Thank you very much,

Yonah Alexandre Bronstein, Ph.D.

I am somehow surprised that Axiom cannot work with multivalues.

(1) -> foo(a: Integer, b: Integer): (String, Integer) == ("sum", a+b);

    The constructor Tuple takes 1 argument and you have given  2  .
(1) -> foo: (Integer, Integer) -> (String, Integer)

    The constructor Tuple takes 1 argument and you have given  2  .

In Aldor the following program works just fine.

Ralf

------------ multi.as -------------------------------------
-- Run the program via
-- aldor -grun -laldor multi.as
-- and get the output
--: We call the function foo
--: foo(7, 11) = (Sum, 18)

#include "aldor"
#include "aldorio"

import from Integer;
foo(a: Integer, b: Integer): (String, Integer) == ("Sum", a+b);
main(): () == {
	stdout << "We call the function foo" << newline;
	(s, c) := foo(7, 11);
	stdout << "foo(7, 11) = (" << s << ", " << c << ")" << newline;
}
main();

In axiom you need to use records:

foo(a: Integer, b: Integer): Record(s: String, r:Integer) == ("sum", a+b);

(Although I'm completely convinced that Aldor is superiour)

Oh, interesting. I would have thought that your line gives a syntax 
error. At least according to the axiom book pp 141 (Section 2.4) one 
should write

foo(a:Integer,b:Integer):Record(s:String,r:Integer)==["sum",a+b];
u := foo(7,11)
u.s
u.r

The Axiom interpreter seems to be clever enough to correctly convert 
("sum", a+b) into the record ["sum", a+b].

For programming, however, I prefer the Aldor way where it gives on your 
line above the following ...

--- begin multi.as
#include "aldor"
#include "aldorio"
import from Integer;
foo(a:Integer,b:Integer):Record(s:String,s:Integer)==("Sum",a+b);

taking this discussion away from the short term summer of code 
so we can think about the bigger issues.....

in the long term (the 30 year horizon) it seems clear that some
sort of browser-like capabilities are assumed. the limitations we
have now seems to be things like:

*  the syntax of the web page does not have a semantic model

we're trying to build a research science platform, not a display GUI object.
we'd like the GUI piece of the system to have a clean, programmable semantics
so we can reason about user actions. we want to reflect user actions (say
handwriting, gestures, clicks, eye-gazes) and system state (say branch cut
crossings, solid model data structure stresses, hill climbing search progress,
as subtle changes to the screen. 

Think of a search space program that does hill climbing (or root finding, 
or ...) that presents it's current state on the system. The user gaze
shifts to various areas and the gaze tracking hardware gives us a vector
for a direction to explore.

*  the DOM model is hierarchical

the DOM is a Document Object Model. it's basically a hierarchical data
structure and it suffers from the same problems that databases used to
suffer, that is, the hierarchy. Hierarchical databases ruled the day
until new theory came around and the world went relational (I know most
of you don't remember it but there was a HUGE fight about this. I attended
a committee meeting about this at a database conference and the major
objection was there would never be enough horsepower or memory to handle
relational searches... beware the future).

*  the DOM model is not really math-aware

i'd envision the DOM being a surface-level representation of the actual
data structures used. the DOM would be available in one of the facets
of the crystal, possibly to support old browsers. there are much more
useful and efficient data structures for representing problem spaces,
state spaces, and system state.

*  the browser cannot interact with the filesystem
*  the browser pages cannot be drawn upon
*  the browser pages are "paper-like"

the browser is a dumb tool at the moment. we need to break out of the
mold, pick a particular browser, and make our own version of it. our
version can be modified to do read/write of the file system, handle
socket connections, present tabbed pages or sub-areas as an active
canvas so Axiom can write graphics or text to them in real time, present
a section of the screen as command-line I/O, show axiom state in special
tabs, allow the browser to start axiom, let it speak lisp, etc.

in short, we need to stop struggling with the limits of current browser
technology, take a standard browser and extend it to our purposes. in
fact, i expect we could do what we do with GCL: package our own version
from a tgz file and add patches to do what axiom needs.

in the 30 year horizon we need something that is useful, impressive,
and reasonably modern. today's tools just hint at what will be common.
we need to listen to the hints, anticipate the needs, and get out in front.
the term i've been using is a "crystal" which is an object with many facets
that "floats" around a central problem description in its own representation.

we need to think about the researcher's problem space in a much deeper
form than current systems do (including Axiom). in the long term we want
to be at the center of the tool set that researchers use to solve problems.

research is long-term, detail-tedious, and takes a lot of work to build
up a big picture. we want to be able to capture problem state, suggest
relevant papers, perform proofs in the background, do speculative 
computations for possible suggestions, pre-generate literate pamphlets
with references and code, etc. we want to draw a wide range of tools
together (math language, graphics, 3D models (organic, engineering, etc),
full-text searches, collaborative tools, etc).


related to the current suggestions i think we are limiting ourselves too
much and creating too tight a straight-jacket by trying to work within
the limits of current browsers and MMA-like worksheets.

choose a browser, get the source, add it to axiom, and extend it in various
ways so we can experiment with ideas. just making it possible for the browser
to read/write the filesystem and present a "canvas" area to axiom puts us
far ahead of the world. it's not ideal but it works.

Yes, most certainly. As usual, I find I agree with many things
you say below, but disagree strong on some specific points.

I think this is not accurate. I might agree if you said
this differently. For example, I do think that the conventional
document semantics of HTML is too limited for our purposes.
Fortunately there is a lot of very active research going
on right now concerning how extended HTML to be a much
richer language or rather, a set of application-specific
related languages such as MathML, SVG, RDF and many more.

I don't think any of these requirements are significantly
different than any other sophisticated web-based application
being built today. In fact I think all of them have already
been used to greater or lesser degree. The problem here, I think,
is just that none of these "virtual reality type" of user
interfaces have ever approached the degree of standardization
that would make web franchising feasible. I mean: not enough
people and projects have bought-in to any one such approach.

I hierarchical data structure is obviously appropriate if the object
you wish to model is hierarchical. Right?

Actually, I was probably at that same meeting. :) Funny that
you should mention this example, because I think that,
in reverse, it actually demonstrates your point and also
lets me make a point I want to make.

The relational data model actually had *less* semantics than
many of the data base systems that were in common use at that
time - both hierarchical and network. In this respect it was
rather like XML today compared to early HTML and SGML. The
compromise was less semantics for greater generality and
mathematical rigour. At the time no one knew how to deal in a
general and rigorous way with data structures more complex
than relations. The lack of semantics is what made people worry
that implementing such general operations would require too
much horsepower, and for a while this was true. It is still
very hard for a purely relational system to match the
performance of a hierarchical database for something that
is naturally hierarchical, for example something like a book
or document.

But here we have examples of two strange principles at
work: 1) less is more, i.e. that lack of semantics is
a good thing if what you want to do is generalize and
formalize something. And 2) worse is better. The fact that
the relational model of data is now very widely accepted
is a good thing in spite of the fact that it is worse at
representing many important data objects.

When we are thinking about a browser for the future
Axiom, I think we need to keep these principles in mind.

Here is one place that I disagree strongly... :)

If there is one lesson that is really clear to me about open
source and the Internet in general, it is that doing really
big things requires collaboration, not cooperation (cooperation
in the sense of the verb to co-opt). By that I mean we have to
learn to depend on and take advantage of the work of others
(other projects) rather than attempt to acquire and control
them.

I think this is a really hard lesson for a traditional programmer
to learn. I always used to hate learning to use someone else's
subroutine library since they never seemed to "think the way
I did". And often there were good reasons related to efficiency,
correctness, and trust that justified this view. But for me
open source, the Internet and very rapidly increasing and
affordable computer power has completely changed my views
about this.

No, no, no!

Other people much smarter and more dedicated than us are
already doing almost everything of this sort that we need.
What we need to do is exactly the opposite. We need to learn
to incorporate and utilize the features and extensions of
current and future generations of browser technology. Axiom's
requirements (along with many other sophisticated browser
based applications) can help to influence the evolution of
browser technology but it should *not* attempt to co-opt and
control it.

This is a matter of design philosophy. Standards are a
very important part of that philosophy. This is one of
the reasons that worse (at least less than ideal) is often
better in the long run.

Again, I find myself wanting to label this as "inappropriate
behaviour" for the Internet and open source. What you are
describing fits quite well with the old corporate model
was largely defined by IBM and then taken to the extreme
by Microsoft, but not with where IBM is today and not with
the open source movement.

To blend another metaphor (anyone remember Carlos Castaneda?)
I think a much better attitude more or less in keeping with
today's "extreme programming" is the "warrior's attitude".
By design we should try to make Axiom flexible and adaptable
and able to take advantage of new browser technology as it
becomes available, even though today we don't know exactly
what that might be. Again, *standards* are one of the best
ways to try to achieve that.

If we can do this I think we might have a good chance of
being at least one of the players in the center of the tool
set. I think proprietary systems will have a much harder
time being and staying in this position.

Yes about this I agree completely. And from my point of
view this is almost exactly the same goal of much of the
leading edge research and development on the web today.

I agree that we have to push those limits, but I think we
are in a very good position to do that from within the
environment of open source and advanced web application
development in general.

Again: no, no, no. :)

But here: yes, yes, yes!

"it's not ideal but it works." is exactly how I want to
characterize the choice of using standard web browsers
on which to base the new (and future) Axiom user interface.

-------

Thanks for your message and thanks for opening this debate,
Tim. Although we often both agree and disagree on many
serious points, I am glad that we have been able to continue
to work together on Axiom and I fully expect this arrangement
to continue. So I know you wont and I don't want others
to think these points of disagreement are a bad thing.
I hope other people will feel free to share their opinions
and reasoning.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

we're debating, not disagreeing. although you're clearly wrong :-)

i agree standards are a *good thing*(TM) but standards come after practice,
not before. when they come before practice they are generally large,
expensive, and overbuilt (e.g. XML)

i agree that browsers are a good thing. they are platform independent,
use standards, and allow marvelous things to happen. or not. in particular
they explicitly do not allow themselves to be used as a useful front-end
for local programs.

i agree that we don't want to re-invent the world and that we want to
follow standard practice. However i disagree that we should work solely
within standards.

what i see us doing is using cheesey work-around languages like javascript
and badly designed data structures like DOM. we're going to end up with
  (a) a program that is "more of the same"
  (b) is in a hard to maintain language that isn't very portable
  (c) hamstrung by the standard-per-browser problem
  (d) encoding our information in latex -> XML -> javascript hacks
  (e) unable to "really communicate" with the user thru the browser
  (f) bending the world to fit the doorway
  (g) unable to start local programs, save state, really interact

think about what we want. we want a portable front-end to axiom that
we can extend in various ways to do truly cool NEW things. we want the
end user of axiom (the spad programmer) to be able to make the front-end
do truly cool NEW things. we want our documentation (pamphlets) to be magic
drag-and-drop, clip and execute, inline moving graphics, managing multiple
programs like axiom, our graphics, ACL2, and other tools. We want to be
able to save state back into a representation that axiom and the front-end
can both use.

current browser technology won't allow us to "extend" it in various ways
(such as making one of the tabs be an axiom shell session). it won't 
read and write pamphlet files (inline latex, inline chunks). it won't
allow drag-and-drop of pamphlets. it can't start or manage local programs.
it can't handle giving up screen real estate as canvas areas. it can't
write to the file system, etc.

yes, you can do some of those tricks with acres of javascript, special
certificates, plugins, cookies, and other hacks. but think of all of
the code you have to write in javascript, html, xml, C, etc. it will
only get MUCH worse as you try to write javascript to read the semantic
network problem data structure and render the appropriate html. javascript
is a horrible language and we have two great languages (spad and lisp).

i'd agree with your approach if we could do something like graph the
algebra hierarchy without a ton of java and a plugin or draw a graph
on a tab from lisp. 

i can almost envision the C code necessary to start axiom (or some other
program) from the browser, hand it the screen area of a tabbed pane, and
present an API from the browser code to draw. if it is 1000 lines i'd
be astonished. all the cross-platform work is already done.

use the browser, keep the standards. but extend the tool to do what you want.
i don't change GCL, i simply extend it to be useful. 
i don't change noweb. i simply add functionality i need.
we won't change the browser, we just need to extend it to be useful.

think of the browser as having solved the cross-platform problem and as
a large library of useful code. now we want to make it sing and dance
to our new ways of thinking. we still do what a browser does (we have
the same base code) but we do so much more.

i'm currently working on making the ISSAC Proceeding CD so i can't 
check out your references at the moment but i will as soon as i can.

i did want to respond to your comment that you didn't think discussion
was useful and that we need running code....

i think the focus on running code is great and i'm a great believer
in "making it work" but in this case i'm trying to raise the discussion
and our eyesight toward the 30 year horizon. 

i am trying to avoid 1.2 million lines of javascript with browser
dependent ifdefs. we already have that problem with C. instead of
trying to work "on top" of the browser, which limits our abilities
to the current available set, i'm trying to think of it as a large 
library of code we can exploit in new ways. and the careful choice
of a lisp available API would make the browser more useful as a
front end and be less maintenance in the long run.

we want to do everything the browser does (because people use them)
but locally we want to do so much more. restricting ourselves to 
require a network and vanilla browser code severely limits the possible
creative choices.

i want people to see axiom do things and get excited about doing more.
so far there is very little i've seen "on the net" that gives me that feel.
i want what i call the "knoppix" reaction.... klaus knopper modified a
standard distribution, made it bootable, and as a result i'm now trying
to build the doyen project. 

anyway, we need to think about the 30 year horizon and what we want when
get there. thus, the discussion.


back to the grind...

I don't like it either. Phyton does the same thing (probably got it from
Axiom). However, the rules are very simple:

One operation per line. No semicolon at the end.

A couple of operations indented by the same amount constitute a "pile". In C
and Aldor, they would be enclosed by { }.

A pile is needed after

*  ==, i.e. a function definition

* for ... repeat
* if ... then

* else

That's all, I think.

Well, both forms are allowed in .spad and .input files. (op1; op2; ...; opn) is
simply a construct to fit n operations in a place where only one is allowed.

I'm afraid no. The approach is different. I'll help when we come to it.

correct.

You can see what )re test.input did to your function definition by typing

test

(without parenthesis) at the prompt:

(16) -> test

   (16)
   test () ==
     output(g)
     g := 6
     l : INT  :=
       10
          output(l)
          l


The following would work.

test():INT == 
 
  output(g)
 
  g := 6
 
  l: INT := 10
 
  output(l)
 
  l

The basic rule in axiom is: one operation per line.
The (operation-1; operation-2; ...; operation-n) construct constitutes one single operation (the
result is the result of operation-n), therefore it has to go on one line. The
following would work:

test():INT == (_
  output(g);_
  g := 6;_
  l: INT := 10;_
   output(l);_
   return(l) )

Only two simple indentation mistakes in the following:

same reason as in the test.input example: (op1; op2;...;opn) is a single
operation, therefore must go on a single line. Use _ ! Furthermore, you forgot
two semicolons:

      stddev(l) == (_
        n := #l; _
      if n = 0 then _
        ( error("The standard deviation of an empty list is not defined") ); _
        m := mean(l);_
        s := 0.0;_
        for i1 in 1..n repeat_
          (s := s + (l(i1) - m)**2); _
        s := sqrt(s/n);_
        return(s) )

Couldn't this be done within a desktop system like KDE or Gnome? These
desktops can be extended in various ways using IPC protocols and
component architectures like DCOP. Admittedly it is not (yet) portable
across desktop systems.

If I may jump in, I'm not clear why there is so much focus on "web" if
by that you mean "world wide web."  My approach to this sort of thing
is to create the ability to visualize what you want to visualize, and
then look to any advantages that might be obtainable from a "networked"
approach.  A big selling point for me on an interface is that any
"networked" or "web aware" parts are nice features, but NOT integral to
the core functionality.  (Not strictly relevant, but an example would
be the CUPS habit of using a custom web server and configuring one's
printers in a web browser.  This has never felt "robust" to me.  It
could be a bias of terminology - to me a "web browser" is something I
use to go look up information on the internet, and therefore by
definition not to be trusted for mission-critical work - I don't want
to have to rely on the "network" working.  Too much openness to the net
is also a security nightmare - I think this is something Maxima might
have to look at some day due to our use of sockets and servers.)  I
prefer to lean towards "stand alone with some helpful web features"
rather than "web browser as GUI."  Maybe I'm just being a grumpy old
stick in the mud.  I suppose a web browser being a GUI on a local
machine could more properly be called a GUI implimentation platform,
but I can't help the feeling of too many layers being piled on one
another.

<cringe>.  I have heard the worse is better argument, and I suppose it
may be correct in the end, but I always had the feeling that if
something really could be done right the first time (REALLY done, not
just discussed) it would win out.  (TeX might arguably be an example of
this.)  If I understand correctly worse is better is in essence a
variation of the "first to market" idea, but Axiom (and Maxima for that
matter) don't need to worry about this - Mathematica and Maple are
already first, and have most all of the market share.  We don't have
anything to lose by doing it "right" - doing it "right" puts us in a
better position for the 30 year horizon and beyond.

I suspect (perhaps Tim you agree with me) that there is very little
software on the internet (or even in the commercial world) written to
the standard to which Axiom wants to aspire.  I am assuming when I make
this statement that Axiom would want to document with literate
programming things like graphing algorithms, 3D techniques, data
visualization routines, 2D mathematical display algorithms, etc. in the
same fashion it has and is documenting the more strictly mathematical
parts of the code base.  I am not aware of any formal work done on
plotting algorithms or the formalization of the rules of 2D
mathematical display.  Hopefully that is just me not knowing enough,
and if such work does exist wouldn't Axiom want to incorporate it?  To
me this is Axiom's true merit and uniqueness - the complete, total
obsession with Doing It Right.

Again, I don't understand the focus on browsers.  As a rule what I
think of as a "browser" is almost by definition insufficient for the
general power you're proposing be added Tim.  What you're talking about
would be almost a whole new class of application.  (A very, VERY
powerful one, with networking features to be sure, but not what I tend
to think of as a "browser" ~= "information viewer," not information
editor.

In the computer version of "long run" I agree worse does tend to be
better, but I think the TRUE long term (i.e. hundreds of years) will
tend to favor code which, as much as possible, is written trying for
the ideal.  Computers and computer software are very short lived by the
standards of almost any other product of similar magnitude, and that is
generally a sign of immaturity.  And after all, look at how long COBAL
has hung around - it could be argued that the whole y2k issue was due
to "worse is better" thinking.

Eh?  I'm moderately confused.  I think Tim is saying that we should aim
for what we would want in a tool, not so much thinking about what the
limits of the current tools are.  That I would agree with - why
shouldn't open source lead the way?

Wouldn't a robust design be flexible and adaptable by definition? 
Supporting standards is a good idea, but one shouldn't be afraid to
move beyond them either - that's where new, better standards come from.

Um.  Not sure I agree with MMA-like worksheets being a limit - I prefer
to think of them as a starting point.  They do some things that are
very good (2D input and output) and some things I'm not so crazy about
(their syntax I don't care for at all.)  But I tend to think of a
"mathematical document" as a paper sized canvas which will accept
arbitrary visualizations and representations, even if MMA doesn't have
that level of flexibility.  Structure is needed in mathematical display
in some form or fashion, and I would tend to think of anything that
offers that (and can preferably be printed to hard copy) as a
mathematical document.

Well, as usual, real products DO win out over vapor.  Someday I hope a
powerful McCLIM based environment is no longer vapor, but that is for
the future :-/.

It doesn't have to be.  All it needs to have is nodes that contain
expressions, figures, or input.  It is totally appropriate to
encapsulate these.  The DOM is for the presentation end, not
calculation.

This is not true.  (Did you try the save button on tiddlywiki?)  Mozilla
will complain about security, but you can tell mozilla to allow it to do
so.  Technically tiddly uses XUL for mozilla and ActiveX under IE.

You mean like this? http://chat.ma.la/draw.html

I think this is more a reflection of people's thought patterns than the
ability of the technology.  Being able to address and modify the
document in response to user requests is hardly "paper-like".

In particular, I like the ability of DOM to address and modify MathML
elements...

I don't think we should make our own version, but I think we should
standardize on Mozilla, which is available under similar licenses to
Axiom.

Already available.

Already available (AJAX).

Remember all interaction is by user request.  Never should the server
need to spontaneously put something on the user's screen.

Demonstrated by Kai to be possible already.

If axiom binds to ports no localhost, one page could show internal state.

Either make a startup script that starts axiom then the web browser, or
possibly one of File.execute or Install.execute in the XPInstall object.

I don't think this is necessary, except by interaction with axiom.

I'm sorry, I meant to have a working demo before I brought this up
again.  From my perspective, everything is possible, it's just a matter
of finding time to paste it all together...

I'm not sure this discussion is useful, what we need is code... ;)

No browser-dependent code.  Pick a browser.  Sorry folks, no
IE/Opera/Safari.  Mozilla is free and people who want to use Axiom will
have to install it.

Not vanilla.  I don't want to have anything to do with browser detection
or making it work in more than one browser.

The ability to independently address parts of the document is very
powerful.  In essence, the browser provides interaction with output math
for us.  We can attach javascript to MathML and know which element the
user clicked on after he clicked the "simplify" button.  We can have a
"show integers" button that will turn the variable "i" red.  We can
"hide output".  We can have mouse-overs indicate the domain of the
object under the mouse cursor.

All of the important user-interaction fundamentals are there.  The
entire mozilla API is accessible from javascript.  Output rendering is
there (jsMath or MathML).  Input editing is there.  Documentation in the
form of hyperlinks and mouse-overs is there.

It seems to me that the options are:
1) Build the math into the browser
2) Build the browser into the math

If a new C++ application is created which embeds the necessary mozilla
components, it will still require javascript ties to user interface
elements.  One step at a time... ;)

I agree. For desktop use we can easily standardize on one browser.
I recommend Mozilla's FireFox. Except for jsMath which is provided
by another project, I don't expect a browser-based interface to
Axiom to require more than a few hunderd lines of JavaScript.

Because of the DOM api and extensions, it is possible to work with
the browser "as a large library of code" without having to get
inside.

As pointed out in another email, it is possible that a lisp API
for the Mozilla browser will be implemented by other developers.
If it exists we could in principle use it instead of JavaScript.
I would expect it to be some time before it was a stable as the
current JavaScript API.

For desktop use no network is required.

I would not characterize Mozilla as simply a "vanilla browser". It
has a lot of provisions for plug-ins and extensions.

For access to a Doyen-like server over the web, I think we may
have to be more flexible with the choice of browser.

On the contrary, many standards have value even though they
may never be put into practice. Standards (should) drive design.
But standards are meant to be broken (and then fixed, again
and again).

In what sense do you think XML is expensive or overbuilt? The
syntax of XML consists of just three production rules.

  xml :== tag [ xml | value ] /tag
  tag :== <name [att]>
  att := name=value

where [ ] means optional and | means alternative. The rest is just
semantics and that gets complicated no matter what language you
choose.

Have you used a Linux desktop lately? If you have, chances are you
have probably already used a browser as a front-end for local
programs and not even known it. Web browser front-ends are also
becoming very popular for embedded applications like network routers,
printer configuration. One of the most popular web browser front-ends

http://www.webmin.com

provides a complete system management interface for Linux servers.

Agreed.

I am not sure that "spad programmer" is a good description of
the Axiom end user since I expect many people will use Axiom
without programming in spad. But I agree that the gui front-end
needs to be easily accessible to the more ambitious Axiom
programmer.

Agreed.

I think the separation between the front-end state and axiom
state is undesirable. State is something that Axiom should
manage. The front-end just needs to be able to render that
state accurately in a variety of visual/audio/tactile ways.

Tim, I really think you are just "fear mongering"! In fact most
of the things you mention are already possible in a browser
like Mozilla very little or no any additional JavaScript coding.
JavaScript is mostly required just to provide the glue.

I am not at all fond of Java in general. JavaScript is just a
dialect of Java specialized for the browser API. I don't think
that it is any worse than Java in general. And Java has been
touted as a kind of "lisp for C programmers"... well, I wouldn't
have exactly said that, but it can't be that bad given the effort
spent on it's development and the amount of open source code that
is available in java.

Well, as you know TouchGraph (a Java application integrated with
the MathAction website) can already do a credible job of graphing
and navigating a complex network.

Kai has demonstrated that drawing a graph using SVG on a browser
can be done with a few hundred lines of GCL lisp code.

Sigh. The debate wears thin ... :)

ok. perhaps i don't know enough about the subject and the recent
advances in browsers so i'll go relearn some javascript in mozilla
before continuing on this thread. i'll try to get axiom to start
mozilla and draw a graph in a page (the graphics functionality)
and see what works.

The Module(R), where R is a commutative ring, is a category for R-modules. Most
algebraic domains are modules. However, Axiom does not seem to have vector
spaces as a separate category, and modules generated by generators and relations
(except FreeModule), which require quotient category. A related domain is
ModuleOperator(R,M).

Hello

I find the complex argument function :
   argument (3+4*%i) computes atan (4/3).

But where is the module or abs complex function :
  how can I get 5 from the complex 3+4*%i ?

Thanks a lot !

I play with complex numbers.

Why there is the complex number sqrt(-1) ?

Is sqrt(-1) equal to %i or not ?
How can I coerce sqrt(-1) to %i.

Have a good day.

Francois

Hi,

sqrt comes from algebraic number as you know.
But if you play with complex number, 
you can use
a:=complex(-1,0)
-- here you 'play' with complex
sqrt a

Hello, 

Is there a the difference between f := t -> 2*t + 1 and f(x)==2*x+1 ?

How can I do f o f o f o ...o f = x -> f(f(f(f...f(x)))) ?
   (I iterate 10 or 100 times)

f := x +-> 3*x 
g := x +-> 2*x+3  

It seems impossible to add 2 anonymous functions. 
I can compute f(x)+g(x) but I can't use (f+g)(x)

Can I do (f o g) or can I only compute f(g(x)) = f g x. 

With mupad (sqrt@@2)(16) and (ln@cos@sin)(PI) compute $2$ and $0$.

Hello Ralf,

It seems it's the pretty method where we build a domain.

I want to play with generic functions of type expression -> expression.

I use (cos@@100)(1.0) with mupad 
when I want u100, with u0=1 and u(n+1)=cos u(n)

>> Hello, Is there a the difference between f := t -> 2*t + 1 and

>> How can I do f o f o f o ...o f = x -> f(f(f(f...f(x)))) ?
>>    (I iterate 10 or 100 times)
>> f := x +-> 3*x g := x +-> 2*x+3  It seems impossible to add 2

Have a good day !

Francois,

On Tuesday, June 28, 2005 10:00 AM you wrote:

I think you have the right idea but perhaps you do not realize
just how rigorous Axiom is when it comes to defining and
operating on functions. What Axiom does is quite simple but
not simply explained. You may have to read several sections of
the Axiom Book carefully several times - sometimes between the
lines.

E.g. 

6.3 Introduction to Functions
6.4 Declaring the Type of Functions
6.6 Declared vs. Undeclared Functions
6.7 Functions vs. Operations
6.9 How Axiom Determines What Function to Use
9.3 BasicOperator
9.50 MakeFunction
9.51 MappingPackage1
10.10 Automatic Newton Iteration Formulas

And here is some discussion of this on MathAction:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FunctionalMapping
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/114MapOnFunctionsCrash

Sometimes even reading the library code helps. (See mappkg.spad.pamphlet)

--------

There are two important things to remember that might seem
quite odd to someone who has used Mupad, Mathematica or Maple:

1) The name cos is just a name, it is *not* a function.
2) Functions in Axiom are objects of type "mapping", i.e. A -> B
   (also called signature).

In Axiom the same name can be used in more than one way (overloading).
The Axiom interpreter has elaborate sometimes heuristic rules for
trying to decide on what mapping to associate with a given name.
Sometimes you have to give it a little help.

> I use (cos@@100)(1.0) with mupad when I want u100, with u0=1 and
> u(n+1)=cos u(n)

This works in Axiom but you have to provide some additional
information

(1) -> cos:Expression Float -> Expression Float := x +-> cos(x)

   (1)  theMap(Closure)
                       Type: (Expression Float -> Expression Float)
(2) -> (cos**100)(1.0)

   (2)  0.7390851332 1516064351
                       Type: Expression Float

Another way is to specify explicitly the package to use for the
function composition. E.g.

(3) -> FuncExpr:=MappingPackage3(Expression Integer, _
                                 Expression Integer, _
                                 Expression Integer);
                        Type: Domain

(4) -> ((sin*exp)$FuncExpr)(x)

               x
   (4)  sin(%e )
                        Type: Expression Integer

(5) -> )show MappingPackage1

(5) -> )show MappingPackage3

>...
> Is there a the difference between f := t -> 2*t + 1 and
> f(x)==2*x+1 ?

You mean

(5) -> f := t +-> 2*t + 1

   (5)  t +-> 2t + 1
                        Type: AnonymousFunction

(6) -> f(2)

   (6)  5
                        Type: PositiveInteger

This defines an "anonymous" function. On page of The Book
it says:

"Every function in Axiom is identified by a name and type.
(An exception is an "anonymous function" discussed in 6.17 on
page 268.) The type of a function is always a mapping of the
form Source -> Target where Source and Target are types. To enter
a type from the keyboard, enter the arrow by using a hyphen "-"
followed by a greater-than sign ">", e.g. Integer -> Integer."

You must declare the type of the function before you can
use it in functional composition:

(7) -> (f::(Expression Integer->Expression Integer)**3)(3)

   (7)  31
                                                     Type: Expression
Integer
(8) -> f := (t:INT):INT +-> 2*t + 1

   (8)  theMap(Closure)
                                                   Type: (Integer ->
Integer)
(9) -> (f**3)(3)

   (9)  31
                                                        Type:
PositiveInteger

The different between an anonymous function and the following
is subtle and as far as I can see only be significant if the
function definition depended on free (global) variables.

(10) -> f(x)==2*x+1
                        Type: Void

In this case f(x) is not (yet) a function. We only know it's
functional form, not it's type. More over, the expression on
the right hand side has not be evaluated (i.e. compiled).

(11) -> f(2)
   Compiling function f with type PositiveInteger -> PositiveInteger

   (11)  5
                        Type: PositiveInteger


> How can I do f o f o f o ...o f = x -> f(f(f(f...f(x)))) ?
>    (I iterate 10 or 100 times)

See examples above.

> f := x +-> 3*x
> g := x +-> 2*x+3
> It seems impossible to add 2 anonymous functions. I can
> compute f(x)+g(x) but I can't use (f+g)(x)

You mean that you would like to treat + as a functional operator?

This one is harder. Trying to do this in the interpret seems
to cause several different kinds of problems in the Axiom
interpreter (such as recently reported by here Ralf Hemmecke).

The proper way to do this is to compiled a new package for the
Axiom library. I wrote a very simple example here:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/SanboxFunctionalAddition

It's only about 10 lines of SPAD code. Let me know if you have
any questions about how it works.

>> Can I do (f o g) or can I only compute f(g(x)) = f g x.

Function composition works using symbol * show above.

> With mupad (sqrt@@2)(16) and (ln@cos@sin)(PI) compute $2$ and $0$.

This works in Axiom.

(1) -> MEI:=MappingPackage1(EXPR INT)

   (1)  MappingPackage1 Expression Integer
                               Type: Domain
(2) -> ((sqrt**2)$MEI)(16)

   (2)  2
                               Type: Expression Integer

(3) -> MEI3:=MappingPackage3(EXPR INT,EXPR INT,EXPR INT)

   (3)
   MappingPackage3(Expression Integer,Expression Integer,Expression Integer)
                               Type: Domain
(4) -> ((log*cos*sin)$MEI3)(%pi)

   (4)  0
                               Type: Expression Integer

Thanks for asking these questions!
