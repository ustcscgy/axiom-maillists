My outgoing mail has disappeared into the void for the last two days.
There seems to be a problem at my ISP (idsi.net) but I'm not sure.

If there are lost emails I have no way to know.

I can also be reached as daly@axiom-developer.org 

Hopefully the problem is fixed.

Dear Marcus,

* PLEASE subscribe to axiom-math. It is pretty low volume and adresses exactly
  the type of questions you tend to ask *

Indeed, it seems that this is a weak point of Axioms static typing
philosophy...

Could you make this more precise? The best thing would be a nearly working
example. I started to make your example below compile, due to lack of time I
took a shortcut -- I hope I captured the essential. (I couldn't get taylorRep
to work)

)abbrev package FOO Foo
Foo(K: CommutativeRing, ULS: UnivariateLaurentSeriesCategory K): 
      Exports == Implementation where

   Exports == with
     f: ULS -> Any

   Implementation == add
     
     SUP ==> SparseUnivariatePolynomial

     f(x) ==
       -- Compute some equation over K.
       eq := monomial(1,2)$SUP(K) - coefficient(x, order x)::SUP(K)

       -- Create an extension L of K.
       L := SimpleAlgebraicExtension(K, SUP K, eq)

       coerce(1::K::L)$AnyFunctions1(L)

Could you now specify in which situation you want to call f and what you want
to do with it? I guess it is a compiler issue?

Martin

I took a stab at this as well, but a few other things pushed this
issue onto the back-burner for now. Here is the modified package code
I came up with to investigate the problem. Perhaps it can be of use to
you. 

======================================================================
SUP ==> SparseUnivariatePolynomial
UTS ==> UnivariateTaylorSeries
SAE ==> SimpleAlgebraicExtension
utsRep ==> Record(expon:I,ps:UTS)

)abbrev package FOO Foo
Foo(K: CommutativeRing, ULS: UnivariateLaurentSeriesCategory K): 
  Exports == Implementation where

    Exports == with
      f: ULS -> Any
    Implementation == add

      taylorRep(x: ULS): UTS(K, variable x, center x) == 
         (x pretend Record(expon:Integer, 
                           ps:UTS(K,variable x, center x))).ps

      f(x:ULS): Any ==
        -- Compute some equation over K.
        eq := monomial(1,2)$SUP(K) _
              - monomial(first coefficients taylorRep x, 0)$SUP(K)

        -- Create an extension L of K.
        L := SimpleAlgebraicExtension(K, SUP K, eq)

        -- Create and return a new Laurent series over L.
        -- The 'zero' variable is necessary due to a compiler bug...
        zero := 0::L
        z := "z"::Symbol
        TS := UnivariateTaylorSeries(L,z,zero)
        LS := UnivariateLaurentSeries(L,z,zero)
        y := map(#1::L, coefficients taylorRep x)$StreamFunctions2(K,L)
        coerce(laurent(-2, series(y)$TS)$LS)$AnyFunctions1(LS)
======================================================================

btw, I dont feel this is a weakness in axioms static typing (its not
really static since we can produce new types at runtime). In my mind,
it is more a weakness w.r.t axioms ability express dependent
signatures. If we could write things like:

    SAE ==> SimpleAlgebraicExtension

    f: (ULS, eq: SUP) -> SAE(K, SUP K, eq)

Then we would could write this kind of function without the loss of
type information.
    
    
Sincerely,
Steve

Well, that's exactly what I meant with "static typing". I have to go and look
what Aldor does with respect to this...

Dear Marcus, Stephen, *

one workaround might be to define your function as a domain or package. For
example:

)abbrev domain BAR Bar
Bar(p:Integer): Exports == Implementation where
  Exports == Join(FiniteFieldCategory,FiniteAlgebraicExtensionField($),_
    ConvertibleTo(Integer))

  Implementation == InnerPrimeField(nextPrime(p)$IntegerPrimesPackage(Integer)_ 
                                    pretend PositiveInteger)


Concerning Aldor, the appropriate section to read seems to be 7.4 of
aldorug.pdf, pgs 77ff. I don't have the time right now to try it out, but it
might work.

Ok, ok, done that... :-)

Yes, this would probably be easily done with true weak typing (as in 
Smalltalk perhaps), but I wonder whether it should not be possible in 
Axiom too.

After all, when I call my function (returning Any) from the command line 
interface, it correctly decapsulates the Any object, so that I can do 
algebra on the returned value. I am trying to imitate some of this magic 
in my spad program.

> Could you make this more precise? The best thing would be a nearly working
> example.

I will try to provide one later, but for now I will try to explain using 
your code.

> Could you now specify in which situation you want to call f and what you want
> to do with it?

Ok, so f returns a value y of type L. Now the caller wants to do some 
arithmetic with y, such as checking if it's zero or not.

In my code, f would actually return a Laurent series over L. The caller 
would then do some linear algebra on the coefficients of this series, 
and eventually calculate the rank of some matrix over L.

For this, the caller really only needs to know that the returned value 
belongs to a domain having a certain category, CommutativeRing, or 
Field, say. That should make it possible to do some matrix calculations 
without knowing the exact type of the code. This sounds like it should 
be simple enough?

So, how can I declare the function f to return "CommutativeRing"?

In usual statically typed languages like Java I would specify a return 
type of Ring, which would be an "interface" definition (or abstract base 
class in C++). Can I do the same thing in Axiom using categories?

Stephen, Martin,

thanks for your help on this. I realize that I need to formulate my 
question more precisely, and I am trying to explain to myself what I am 
really trying to do...

> it is more a weakness w.r.t axioms ability express dependent
> signatures. If we could write things like:
> 
>     SAE ==> SimpleAlgebraicExtension
> 
>     f: (ULS, eq: SUP) -> SAE(K, SUP K, eq)

The situation here is somewhat more difficult since eq is not known to 
the caller, but calculated inside the function f. So the signature could 
not be written this way.

Marcus

Aldor is not that much of a problem: the languages are nearly identical. You
can even use the "pile" syntax, used in spad. The following will probably look
more familiar to you:

#pile

Foo(): Exports == Implementation where

  Exports == with
    
    f:(n:Integer)->IntegerMod(n) 

  Implementation == add

    f(n:Integer):IntegerMod(n) == coerce(10)$IntegerMod(n)

This is perfectly valid Aldor, too. (modulo typos)

You can use it for package calling. I.e., if the function is implemented in the
category -- as "default" implementation -- you can use it.

I don't understand, but this is probably due to my ignorance...

Martin,

> Aldor is not that much of a problem: the languages are nearly identical.

Ok, I might give it a try then, once they fix their download page (the 
link to the Linux binary is broken).

>  > Perhaps I will just inline the functions, and do without function calls.

To be precise: I unrolled the function calls, replacing them with the 
function's code inlined. That means replacing recursive function calls 
with iteration, which is uglier.

Unfortunately it still won't compile, but I hope this is just a matter 
of correct syntax. Here is the code, I would be grateful if someone can 
give me a hint:

-------------------------------------------------------------------
)abbrev package LOCPARM LocalParam
LocalParam: Exports == Implementation where
   INT    ==> Integer
   POSINT ==> PositiveInteger
   NNI	 ==> NonNegativeInteger
   UTS    ==> UnivariateTaylorSeries
   ULS    ==> UnivariateLaurentSeries
   SUP	 ==> SparseUnivariatePolynomial
   ANY1   ==> AnyFunctions1

   Exports ==> with

     localParam: (POSINT, NNI) -> Any

   Implementation ==> add

     localParam(p, n) ==
       K := Fraction Polynomial(PrimeField p)
       -- The zero variable is used here due to a compiler bug
       zero := 0::K
       var := new()$Symbol
       LS := ULS(K, var, zero)
       x := monomial(1, -1)$LS
       for i in 1..n repeat
         a := new()$Symbol
         b := new()$Symbol
         rhs := a::LS*x + b::LS*x**3

         f := coefficients taylorRep rhs
         d := degree rhs
         -- Reduce the pole to minimal possible order.
         while negative? d and zero? (d rem p) repeat
           eq := monomial(1,p)$SUP(K) - monomial(first f, 0)$SUP(K)
           L := SimpleAlgebraicExtension(K, SUP K, eq)
           f1 := map(#1::L, f)$StreamFunctions2(K,L)
           -- subtract w^p-w from f1
           f1.1 := 0
           j := 1 + (d quo p) - d
           f1.j := f1.j + (basis()$L).p
           while (negative? d and zero? first f1) repeat
             f1 := rest f1
	    d := d+1
	  f: Stream L := f1
           K := L
-------------------------------------------------------------

Explanation: I have a ring K. I create another ring L which is a 
SimpleAlgebraicExtension of K. I then want to replace K with L and 
iterate. But Axiom won't allow the assignment K:=L.

The while loop would have been replaced with a recursive function in my 
original attempt, if Axiom had allowed it.

(This code will also need a coercion of the return value to Any before 
it compiles correctly, but never mind...)

I get the following compiler error:
------------------------------------------------
        ....stuff removed here
      (|exit| 1 | << | (LET K L) | >> |))
****** level 3  ******
$x:= (LET K L)
$m:= NoValueMode
$f:=
((((|f| # # #) (|d| # #) (|f1| # #) (#:G1496 #) ...)))

    >> Apparent user error:
    Cannot coerce L
       of mode (MonogenicAlgebra K (SparseUnivariatePolynomial K))
       to mode (Join (QuotientFieldCategory (Polynomial (PrimeField p))) 
(CATEGORY package (IF (has (Polynomial (PrimeField p)) 
(IntegerNumberSystem)) (IF (has (Polynomial (PrimeField p)) (OpenMath)) 
(ATTRIBUTE (OpenMath)) noBranch) noBranch) (IF (has (Polynomial 
(PrimeField p)) (ATTRIBUTE canonical)) (IF (has (Polynomial (PrimeField 
p)) (GcdDomain)) (IF (has (Polynomial (PrimeField p)) 
(ATTRIBUTEcanonicalUnitNormal)) (ATTRIBUTE canonical) noBranch) 
noBranch) noBranch)))
------------------------------------------------

Which is understandable. I suppose the variable K needs to be cleared 
somehow.

FYI.....


Bill,

Notice that there is a Satelite Workshop on 
"Internet Accessible Mathematical Computation"
which sounds an awful lot like MathAction.

Advise: 

* When I start programming a function, I always start with a nearly empty
procedure body, which returns some arbitrary value (for example, 0) in the
goal-domain. Then I add functionality bit by bit, such that it always
compiles. Otherwise I experienced unintelligible compiler errors, which didn't
make any sense.

* never use tabs. If you do, please untabify before you send it per email!

* unfortunately, I don't understand the code below too well. What would you want
  to return, if there were no compiler problems?

* I'm rather weak in Algebra. Could you do a very simple example for me, just
  that I realize what the resulting domain would be? I understand that 

K:=SAE(FRAC INT, UP(x,FRAC INT), x^2+1::UP(x,FRAC INT))

  should be the domain of complex integers, shouldn't it? If I extend this
  domain again,

L:=SAE(K, UP(y, K), eq::UP(y, K))

  what do I get? Isn't this again a SAE of FRAC INT, only with a different
  defining polynomial? If this is correct, Axiom doesn't know this, does it?

Martin,

Well, it should be Q(i), the field of rational numbers extended with i.

> If I extend this domain again,

> L:=SAE(K, UP(y, K), eq::UP(y, K))

A finite extension of Q(i). Now it happens that this extension will have 
a primitive element, i.e., it is generated over Q by _one_ element a, so 
it is equal to Q(a). But this is only because the ground field Q is of 
characteristic zero, so the extension is automatically separable. In 
general the extension is not necessarily generated by one element.

(In fact in my case the extension will certainly not be separable, as 
you will see below.)

 > Isn't this again a SAE of FRAC INT, only with a different

Yes, in the example above (but not in general).

> If this is correct, Axiom doesn't know this, does it?

No, I don't think it does, and I don't think it should either.

I am trying to do the following, which is a common procedure when 
dealing with Artin-Schreier extensions:

1. Input is a Laurent series f with coefficients in a field K of 
characteristic p>0. If f satisfies one of the following conditions:
A.  f has no terms with negative order, or
B.  the leading term of f is of order -m where m>0, and m is not 
divisible by p,
then stop and return f.

2. Otherwise we can find a p-th root of the leading coefficient of f in 
a suitable extension field L of K, and hence a monomial w such that f + 
w^p - w has a pole of smaller order than f.

3. Replace f by f+w^p-w and K by L, and go back to 1.

So I am trying to do a sequence of field extensions of K.

The result will be a Laurent series over one of these repeated 
extensions, which I would like to return. But for now, I will be happy 
if I can just get the code to run correctly and return some dummy value.

The problem seems to be in step 3, where I try to reassign the domain 
variable K. I am not sure how to do this. It seems to confuse Axiom.

Here is a version which does compile, but with warnings. (Note that it 
constructs a special series f, and the inner while loop is the algorithm 
I described above):

---------------------------------------------------
)abbrev package LOCPARM LocalParam
LocalParam: Exports == Implementation where
   INT    ==> Integer

       LS := UnivariateLaurentSeries(K, var, zero)
       x := monomial(1, -1)$LS
       for i in 1..n repeat
         a := new()$Symbol
         b := new()$Symbol
         rhs := a::K*x + b::K*x**3

         f := coefficients taylorRep rhs
         d := degree rhs
         -- Reduce the pole to minimal possible order.
         while negative? d and zero? (d rem p) repeat
           eq := monomial(1,p)$SUP(K) - monomial(first f, 0)$SUP(K)
           L: CommutativeRing := SimpleAlgebraicExtension(K, SUP K, eq)
           f1 := map(#1::L, f)$StreamFunctions2(K,L)
           -- subtract w^p-w from f1
           f1.1 := 0
           j := 1 + (d quo p) - d
           f1.j := f1.j + (basis()$L).p
           while (negative? d and zero? first f1) repeat
             f1 := rest f1
             d := d+1
           f: Stream L := f1
           K := L
         return coerce(d)$ANY1(Integer)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This gives the following compiler warning:
---------------------------------------------
    Warnings:
       [1] localParam: domain valued variable K has been reassigned 
within its scope
---------------------------------------------

Despite the warning, the code does run when called as localParam(2,1), 
but I cannot make it return something more useful, such as the series 
(or stream) f. All my attemps just lead to more compiler warnings and 
"system errors" when I run the code.

So my question is, is the code even legal in Axiom? Can I disregard the 
compiler warning?

*,

I'm in the process of trying to merge the axiom--windows--1 branch
with the axiom--main--1 branch.

There are dozens of files with changes and no documentation.
It is painfully obvious that the message isn't getting out.

The point of the free and open source Axiom is documented code.
This project differs from all other projects in one main feature;
every file in the system is a tex document. There are no C, lisp,
boot, spad, Makefile, include files, etc. EVERYTHING is (or will be)
a DOCUMENT. You're not writing C code, you're writing a document.

The reason that Axiom is all documents is because *I* wrote portions
of Axiom many years ago and commented nothing. Now I'm looking at my
own code and, even though I tried to write dirt-simple, perfectly 
clear code, I no longer understand the "why" of it. The end result
is that Axiom is very hard to maintain and modify. As time permits
I'm going back and writing the documentation for the existing code.

If Axiom is going to be a living project we MUST change the way 
Axiom developers write and modify code. How else is someone, 30
years from now, supposed to understand and update your code?

So if you make a change to the source DOCUMENT you really do need to
write a paragraph that explains the need for the change and what was
changed.

If you don't write a paragraph to explain the change then I have to
reverse-engineer your change, write the documentation, and hand-merge
the results.

As a result the axiom--windows--1 merge is going VERY slowly. There
are undocumented changes to the algebra, to the interpreter, and to
the library code.

If you made changes to the axiom--windows--1 branch please revisit
the changes and send me patches that contain documentation; not just
comments, real words about why the change was needed. Write for the
future maintainers.

Believe me, I know that it is painful to have to write documentation.
But without it Axiom will surely die. Please take the time.

Tim

Dear Marcus,

I looked a little at your code. Some comments and a "patch":

            while (negative? d and zero? first f1) repeat

         res:Any :=3D coerce(first(f))$ANY1(K)

         return res

Thanks for your explanations, it is clearer now!

It's a sensible warning, of course, but I don't know its relevance.  Ma=
ybe this
is related to the following -- from aldorug.pdf, page 77:

Name constancy As a related but more fundamental concern, an expression=
 in type
               context must only contain names which are constant over =
the
               scope in which the type occurs, because, without this ru=
le, it
               would not be possible to associate well-defined types to=

               expressions.

               Consider the following incorrect function, which uses a =
domain
               called MachineIntegerMod (see AXIOMimodnSample for a def=
inition)
               which is parameterised by an Integer:

                    f(n: Integer): () =3D=3D {
                            local a, b: MachineIntegerMod(n);
                            a :=3D coerce((3 * n + 1) quo 2);
                            b :=3D coerce((5 * n + 1) quo 3);
                            if n > 4 then    n :=3D n + 1;   -- ILLEGAL=
!
                            c :=3D a - b;
                            stdout << "The result is " << c << newline
                    }

               The problem is that if n is updated, the type of a and b=
 is no
               longer valid and there is no reasonable interpretation f=
or "-"
               or "c".  The names appearing in an expression in type co=
ntext
               may be
                   =B7 defined via "=3D=3D",
                   =B7 imported via "import", or
                   =B7 function parameters which are nowhere updated.

Bertfried,

There are now three distinct meanings for "the axiom book".

Meaning 1: The printed version, although this is the least likely
meaning at the moment.

Meaning 2: the big book.pamphlet file which is distributed with
the axiom system and is also in book--main--1. This is the latest
version of the information in a single form.

Meaning 3: there has been considerable discussion about actually
publishing the axiom book (under meaning 2) at a site called 
www.lulu.com which is an internet publisher.

Several issues have arisen which are shaping the future direction(s?):

We've discovered that lulu has certain constraints. There is a 700
page limit. Since the main book is 1000+ pages this is a problem.
the solution which we've adopted is to break the book into (originally
3, now 4) parts: 
  vol1 (tutorial), 
  vol2 (programming),
  vol3 (reference)
  vol4 (developer guide)
with possible follow-on volumes, such as one based on Littlewood's
Skeleton Key of Mathematics book. I have yet to hear back about the
copyright issue and I'll pursue that further.

I've done some work to fragment the main book into 4 parts and a
small amount of work on the first volume. But it became apparent 
that the tutorial volume assumed that hyperdoc was available so 
I've been bending the sails to get that to run. The February 2005
monthly axiom release will have hyperdoc and graphics integrated
(and the latest axiom--main--1 version already has this).

As we get the various volumes into reasonable shape we will be in
a position where people can actually order hard copies of the volumes.
There has been talk of offering a CD with the tutorial volume. The
big problem is that lulu.com requires a pre-order of 100 copies
if this option is chosen.

I also spent a few days and recovered the "end papers" from the 
hardcopy book, encoded as "endpaper.pamphlet".

On another path there is work going on (off list) with another 
person to put together a linear algebra course using hyperdoc
which might result in another small volume. 

I'm hoping the littlewood book will also act as a seed for a
volume which approaches the subject more from the mathematics
than from the 'axiom' side. 

I have a couple other books I'm also looking at, for example, in
differential equations (Krantz, Steven "Differential Equations
DeMYSTiFieD", McGraw-Hill, 2005, ISBN 0-07-144025-9). I have this in
my local code swamp but have not yet added it to the book branch.

Another path to be pursued is to contact and cooperate with
www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/known-math/index/tour_alg.html
to organize axiom discussions relative to published standards.
This is also of interest for the CATS (Computer Algebra Test
Suite) effort which I still have to upload to the arch server.

Does anyone happen to know Dr. Rusin?

To build the current version of the work do:

tla get book--main--1
cd book--main--1--patch*
make


As Bill mentioned, you should look at http://arch.axiom-developer.org
and follow the instructions at the bottom of the page for getting a key
generated. This will give you direct read-write access to the book.

*,

We continue planning a conference focusing on the end user of Axiom.
It is intended to appeal to the various math and science programs at
universities.

The last announcement on this mailing list generated a request for a
"sprint day", that is, a day when we can all get together and work on
Axiom in the same room.

The conference is on a Friday in New York City. Perhaps we can have
the sprint day on thursday as that will leave your weekend free for
sight-seeing if you've never been here.

I'm trying to arrange for funding for the sprint day and it looks 
like a strong possibility with a lot of dependent variables.

If you have any interest in showing up for a day of programming on
Axiom in the same room, or even to chat about and make a plan for
future directions, now is the time to speak up.

Tim

SECOND CALL FOR PAPERS

TOPICS

The program committee welcomes submissions on all aspects of theorem
proving in higher order logics, on related topics in theorem proving
and verification, and on relevant applications. The topics include,
but are not limited to, the following:

 * Specification and verification of hardware: microprocessors, memory
   systems, buses, pipelines, etc; formal semantics of hardware design
   languages; synthesis; formal design flows.

 * Specification and verification of software: program verification,
   refinement, and synthesis for functional, declarative and
   imperative languages; formal semantics of programming languages;
   proof carrying code.

 * Industrial application of theorem provers.

 * Formalization of mathematical theories.

 * Advances in theorem prover technology: proof automation and
   decision procedures, induction, combination of deductive and
   algorithmic approaches, incorporation of theorem provers into
   larger systems, combination of theorem provers with other provers
   and tools.

 * Other topics, including: security algorithms, properties, and
   policies; specification and requirements analysis of systems; user
   interfaces for theorem provers; development and extension of higher
   order logics.

 * Proof Pearls: concise and elegant presentations of interesting
   examples.

Relevant research involving interactive first-order systems, such as
ACL2 and Mizar, is also welcome. All authors are reminded that their
work should be presented in a way that users of other systems can
understand.

SUBMISSIONS

Submissions are invited in the following categories: Mature Work and
Emerging Trends.

                          Mature Work               Emerging Trends

Axiom Conference Announcement
_____________________________

When:    April 22, 2005
Where:   The City College of New York
Contact: Bernice Ravitz <bernice@rio.sci.ccny.cuny.edu>

There will be a Conference on Axiom on April 22, 2005 at the City
College of New York. The focus of the conference will be to
demonstrate the power and scope of Axiom to a general scientific
audience. The conference is being hosted by CAISS, the Center for
Algorithmic and Interactive Scientific Software. Timothy Daly, a
senior research scientist at CAISS and a Research Associate in the
Computer Science Department of CCNY has been heavily involved in the
development of AXIOM over many years.

Axiom, developed by IBM and released as open source software by NAG,
has now been rebuilt by many developers into its original form
together with a new version for Windows. Preceding the conference, on
April 21st, will be a "sprint" day devoted to defining future
directions and a marathon programming session in the CAISS Open
Software Lab. Everyone is encouraged to participate. Help will be
available for new developers.

The Acting Dean of Engineering, Joe Barba and the Dean of Science,
Maria Tamargo, are sponsoring the conference, which is also supported
by the National Science Foundation. Further funding has been made
available by the Chancellor of the City University of New York, Dr.
Matthew Goldstein and the Provost of the City College of New York,
Zeev Dagan, for both travel and accommodation for some participants
and attendees of one or other or both events.

Details of the talks on April 22nd and the get-together on April 21st
will be posted on the CAISS web-site, www.caissny.org in the next few
weeks.

Anyone interested in attending should email
Bernice Ravitz <bernice@rio.sci.ccny.cuny.edu>.

The conference is being organized by Gilbert Baumslag, Timothy Daly,
Gretchen Ostheimer, William Sit and Douglas Troeger.

The February 2005 release of Axiom has been posted to:

 savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom
 sourceforge.net/projects/axiom
 arch.axiom-developer.org as axiom--main--1--patch-29

This is the first "feature complete" release of Axiom. It includes
all of the algebra we have available, working graphics, and a working
hyperdoc browser. Once you build the system you can test it by typing:

axiom

when the hyperdoc browser starts choose

  Basic Commands -> Draw -> A function of two variables -> Continue -> Do It

and a graph will appear. Click anywhere on the graph to get the control panel.

A Source tarball and binaries for several platforms are being compiled
and will be uploaded as they become available.

Please report any bugs at:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage/IssueTracker

This is a wiki page and you can modify it from your browser to add bugs.
Please be sure to note the 'Version' listed on the banner when Axiom 
starts so we can track which version has the bug.

Questions should be sent to the axiom-developer@nongnu.org mailing list.

The February 2005 release is known to build on RedHat and Fedora systems
including Fedora 3. Be sure to use the ./configure script.

The Solaris 9 merger is still in process and may not yet build correctly
from these sources. A working version of Axiom has been built for Solaris 9
which includes both graphics and hyperdoc. The ./configure script should
properly recognize the solaris system.

The Windows merger is still in process and may not yet build correctly
from these sources. A working version of the algebra but not the graphics
and hyperdoc exists. Efforts are underway to make portable versions of
the graphics and hyperdoc but that will take a while. See
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomDownload

The MAC OSX port is being worked on. There is no further news.

The March 2005 release is now open for changes.
Immediate items of work are:
  finish and test Solaris 9 changes
  finish and merge Windows changes
  finish and merge the "fixed-point" changes to the algebra
  automate patch file handling in hyperdoc
  create beta version of MAC OSX
  first steps toward hypertex in common lisp
  create pre-print version of volume 1 (tutorial) of book
  continue bug collection from axiom-developer mailing list to IssueTracker
