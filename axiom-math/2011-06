Dear all,

we can help ourselves in some cases by:

sign x == (abs x)/x
H x == (1 + sign x)/2
step (a,b,x) == (H(x-a)) * (H(b-x))

The drawback is that we get a 'Division by zero'.

Kind regards,
Stefan

Show a short program that demonstrates this error message. Only then is 
somebody able to help.

PS: "sign" is already built-in. Try out

In Axiom, we can implement a characteristic function for a 
given set, in the category of sets, which would avoid 
division by zero.  This can take care of the provisos. If 
I am not mistaken, the step(a,b,x) is the characteristic 
function for the interval set [a,b], but the 
implementation below, as pointed out, may cause division 
by zero. We can use "if-then-else" to implement it 
instead.
