The proviso work is all in paper form in a pile and now in a
packed box. I'll see if I can guess which one it is but I'd
rather not unpack the world until after the move. I really should
keyboard this stuff. I did it before the net was all the rage and
the paper is just rotting away now.

  the proviso idea is fundamental to math but ignored or treated badly
  by all computer algebra systems. provisos arise in things like:

    1
   ---   provided x != 0
    x

  it turns out that a deep investigation of the subject yields a
  few insights. 

  1) provisos have two different forms of mathematics
     a) computing WITH provisios (e.g what is (1/x)*(1/y))
     b) computing IN provisos (e.g. what is (provided a>0)*(provided a<0))

  2) provisos contain general branching
     it is possible to have a computation (such as the above)
     break into parts (e.g. x<0, x=0, x>0) at every stage of
     the computation. this necessitates general control structures
     such as backtracking, stacking, early cutoff, etc. I have
     identified 8 different possible forms.

  3) most proviso forms can be reduced to intervals (an unpublished result)

  4) provisos are a poorly studied area of math but vital for understanding
     computational mathematics.

As for the indeterminates (now called indefinites) this is a currently
funded NSF project at CCNY. There are no papers available yet. The basic
idea is to examine questions like:

  if p and q are polynomials 
  we know what the third term of p^3 * q^4 is 
  but what is third term of p^n * q^m?

  if M is a matrix and n is an indefinite integer
  what is the general term for M_{i,j} in M^n

  normally in a computer algebra system, 
  given n+1
  we presume n is of type 'variable' and 1 is of type 'integer'
  we promote both n and 1 to type 'polynomial(integer)'
  we choose '+' from polynomial(integer)
  and the result is that n+1 is of type polynomial(integer).

  but suppose 'n' is an "indefinite integer"
  then we can construct n+1 where '+' comes from indefinite(integer)
  and the result is that n+1 is of type indefinite(integer)
  so we can use this new thing where integer is expected 
  and construct things like polynomial(indefinite(integer))
  
  does the 'indefinite' type propagate? do we get
  indefinite(polynomial(indefinite(integer)))?

The two subjects are deeply related and very poorly studied.
They are both fundamental to computational mathematics.

Axiom is the perfect platform for doing this kind of research.
It has a 'suchthat' type which was my first attempt at this
but I've come to understand that the issue is more fundamental.

MATLAB appears to have a wiki which sponsors programming contests:

http://www.mathworks.com/contest/ants/home.html

The most interesting property seems to be that they get better 
algorithms if everyone collaborates on the wiki.

Perhaps we should borrow this idea and highlight the algorithm
of the month on the axiom wiki.

Mupad does this :

>> solve (a^2*x-a=3Dx+1, x)
           / {  a + 1 }                                                \
  piecewise| { ------ } if not a in {-1, 1}, C_ if a =3D -1, {} if a =3D 1 |
           | {  2     }                                                |
           \ { a  - 1 }                                                /

limit (a*x*exp (a*x), x=3D+infinity) ; // is unevalued

but this three commands are right :
assume (a>0) ;  limit (a*x*exp (a*x), x=3D+infinity)
assume (a=3D0) ;  limit (a*x*exp (a*x), x=3D+infinity)
assume (a<0) ;  limit (a*x*exp (a*x), x=3D+infinity)

I don't understand if this packages is in the debian-axiom,=20
the 2005-02 version, will be in the next version, or isn't yet in=20
one package ?

I'm a first-year university teacher, I used mupad and I think I will use=20
axiom because it's really a free program.=20

The first question that one colleague ask to me when we speak about computer
algebra is : can I do assume hypothesis with axiom ?

Have a good day !

I like this idea, but can we really make it fly? Certainly we
can advertise the winners and make some nice looking web pages
with photographs and all, but what can we offer as "prizes".
This is one of the delemma's of free open source software.
And that reminds me ...

I have been wondering whether it might be worthwhile to arrange
for some Axiom promotional "stuff":

  1) Axiom t-shirts
  2) Axiom hats
  3) Axiom coffee mugs

etc. like http://www.mozillastore.com

There are several web.coms that offer this sort of product but
typically the project only receives a small portion of the
profit. Of course a small portion is a lot more than nothing,
and given that donations to the Axiom Foundation have not
progressed at all beyond those of the initial "dedicated few",
I don't see any alternative when it comes to raising some funds
to promote Axiom.

Ideas? Opinions?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear all,

I'd like to have axiom draw two functions in the same viewport, for example 

x^2*y^3 and it's tangential plane in the point (1,-1).

I tried merge and composite with no success. Any ideas? (best thing would be an
example!

I just realized: extensive documentation how to have multiple graphs in one
viewport, no matter what its dimension, is in the axiom book, Section 7.2...

Thanks again,

Martin

Hello,=20

expand (cos (x+y)) is right.
but how can I do expand (cos (2*x)) in cos(x)^2 - sin(x)^2 by example.

And how can I get the source file of this expand ?

Thanks a lot.

Fran=E7ois
