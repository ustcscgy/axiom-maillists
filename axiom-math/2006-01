Hello.

I'm using Axiom in Debian GNU/Linux for corroborate some results of
numerical calculus. In a exercise of inverse Laplace transform, I've to
calculate f(0) if F(s) = (s**2 - 9*s - 32)/(2*s**3 - 3*s + 4).

At the begining, I thought to use partial fraction decomposition but the
denominator have irrational roots :-( Then I thought to use Axiom for
give me a idea of its resolution. The fact is that inverseLaplace give
me %%A0 or %%AO squared in the solution. How this values are
interpreted?

Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Daniel

The a = %%A0 is the real root of the denominator, which then factors as:

2*s**3 - 3*s + 4 = (s - a)(2*s**2 + 2*a*s + 2*a**2 -3)

The coefficients of t in the exponential functions are the roots of the
quadratic factor based on the quadratic formula. Axiom should have said what
%%A0 is.

I didn't know that %%A0 was the real root of the denominator. When I
execute inverseLaplace, it only show the packages loading but not what
%%A0 is. Ought I to configurate something in order that Axiom
automatically shows the roots values?

This Axiom's solution doesn't seem equal to the solution that I
obtained by partial fraction decomposition using the approximate
root value of -1.647426657:

f(t) = -1.088456053*exp(-1.647426657*t) + exp(0.823713328*t) *
        * [ 1.588456054*cos(0.731786132*t - 20.77542511*sin(0.731786132*t) ]

In fact, if we replace the approximate root value, the radicands turn
into negative value :-S

I think that my solution is correct because f(t) is continuous in t = 0
and f(0) ---the exercise request to find f(0)--- can be verified by the
initial value theorem. I saw the resolution of cathedra's director and
she solved the exercise _only_ using the initial value theorem but I
think that it's wrong because it's only true if f(t) is continuous :-|

Regards,
Daniel

I am having some problem with the if-then-else syntax in the .input 
files.

Problem 1: I refer to the axiom book which ships with the program 
(version 2005/09). At page 204 it says that the usual rules for piling are 
suspended in conditional expressions and it gives 5 different ways which 
should be equivalent, namely:

if i>0 then output("positive") else output("nonpositive")

if i > 0 then output("positive")
   else output("nonpositive")

if i > 0 then output("positive")
else output("nonpositive")

if i > 0
then output("positive")
else output("nonpositive")

if i > 0
   then output("positive")
   else output("nonpositive")


Well, I tried all of them, creating each time a blank r.input file with 
inside only

i := 2

followed by one of the "if...".

The result is that the first two are ok, where as the other three give 
some syntax error (different each time).

So: what is happening? Is the book wrong?!?!

Problem 2: again with if then else, in a complex function I noticed a 
wrong result (the function itself was ok... ;-)
Simplifying, you can produce the same error with something like:

test: (INT,INT) -> List(INT,INT)
test(a,b) ==
  x := 0; y := 0
  if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then
   x := 1 ; y := 1
  [x,y]

Then, test(4,-2) returns correctly [1,1], but test(4,-3) or test(4,2) 
returns wrongly [0,1]. The same happens if I write

  if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then  x := 1 ; y := 1

Why?

Another small question. Is there a way to obtain on line the syntax of a 
command in a more extensive way? I mean, for example, that writing
(3) -> )di op extendedEuclidean

I get

(3) ->
There are 2 exposed functions called extendedEuclidean :
    [1] (D,D,D) -> Union(Record(coef1: D,coef2: D),"failed") from D
             if D has EUCDOM
    [2] (D,D) -> Record(coef1: D,coef2: D,generator: D) from D if D has
             EUCDOM

which is not too useful. Moreover, how can I just ask about, say, the 
second function extendedEuclidean?

If I wanted to ask about the syntax of if-then-else, I would like to write
something like
)? if
or
)ap if

but nothing gives clues on how to use it.


Thank you for all your help

Fabio Stumbo

Worse than that: **both** :(

You have found bugs in both the documentation and in the
implementation!

There seems to be a bug in the Axiom interpreter that does not
treat the pile syntax correctly when the if statement is the
outer most block. So for example, if you try the third and
fourth cases shown in the Axiom book, but nest them inside
another block like this:

  for i in 2..2 repeat
    if i > 0 then output("positive")
    else output("nonpositive")

  for i in 2..2 repeat
    if i > 0
    then output("positive")
    else output("nonpositive")

the nested if statements are both parsed and executed properly.

But as you reported both of these

  if i > 0 then output("positive")
  else output("nonpositive")

  if i > 0
  then output("positive")
  else output("nonpositive")

given syntax errors when they are the outer most block. There
should be no difference.

On the other hand the last example given in the book:

  if i > 0
    then output("positive")
    else output("nonpositive")

**is wrong** and it is also (correctly) reported as a syntax
error even if we write it nested inside another block:

  for i in 2..2 repeat
    if i > 0
      then output("positive")
      else output("nonpositive")

Further the statement that the "pile syntax is suspended" in the
book is both wrong and misleading. There are no cases in Axiom
when the pile syntax in suspended. I think the author of that part
of the book was confused.

The problem is that you are mixing the two methods of writing blocks.
The use of the ';' separator in pile syntax might be confusing since
it is expected to be used with ( ) to form a block. Your statement:

   if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then
     x := 1 ; y := 1

is interpreted by Axiom as if you had written either:

   if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then
      x := 1
   y := 1

or

   if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then (x := 1;) y := 1

So you should write:

 test: (INT,INT) -> List(INT)
 test(a,b) ==
   x := 0; y := 0
   if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then
     x := 1
     y := 1
   [x,y]

-------

Note: List only takes one argument. In Axiom lists are homogeneous
(all elements of the list must be of the same type).

The correct alternative way to write this would be:

  if (a rem b = 0) and b < 0 then (x := 1 ; y := 1)

If you are not using the pile syntax, then you must group
statements using parenthesis. In the Axiom interpreter these
parentheses are treated the same way as brackets the { } in
some other languages.

I think you should try Axiom's hyperdoc browser. (Unfortunately it
is only currently available in the linux version of Axiom.) Hyperdoc
provides a lot of useful information of this kind for the new Axiom
user.

Seriously, I think you have made a good contribution. Axiom
is now open source software and depends on reports of errors
such as yours. Sooner or later someone else will also help to
correct the problem.

That syntax in "pile" format would be equivalent to

  if i > 0 ( then output("positive"); else output("nonpositive") )

which would correspond to misplaced brackets { } in some other
languages.

I agree but I would not say that they are "incompatible" -
only that the combination produces some unexpected results.
I think the Axiom implementation should probably be changed
to correspond to modern usages such as in Python and other
languages that use indentation.

Again, I agree. I also do not use Hyperdoc very much. My experience
is also that it often crashes, although I am not yet able to
document a specific sequence which causes a crash. If we could
report and reproduce such bugs, then it should not be difficult
to correct the problems. But even then, I do not much care for the
"look" of the user interface. There have been much discussion and
some programming work to replace Hyperdoc with a modern web
browser interface, but so far we do not have a good replacement
for Hyperdoc.

Could you explain more what you mean by "synthetic". Could you
give some examples?

I am glad that you mentioned it.

Excellent! This is exactly the kind of use of Axiom that I think
we need to encourage. I am sure you can expect to receive a lot of
help from the Axiom user group with any problems that you report
here.

Are you aware that there is new tutorial book by Tim Daly about
Axiom that can be purchased through the university book store
(ISBN 141166597X)

http://www.bookfinder4u.com/IsbnSearch.aspx?isbn=141166597X&mode=direct

or direct from the publisher:

http://www.lulu.com/content/190827

I hope that this will encourage the use of Axiom in teaching.

Bill Page.

Hello Fabio and Bill !

the do command can help :

do
  if i > 0
  then output("positive")
  else output("nonpositive")

But there is a new problem : do is the only (?) axiom command
which has et void result.=20
=20
You can use a test inside a function : the result of the test is 1 or -1.
...
  if i > 0
  then 1
  else -1
...

But if you use the do command you can't get the result of the test.
So you can't use :
do
  if i > 0
  then 1
  else -1

Is it possible to have a sharper interpreter in a futur version.
I really like language that have a really short grammar.

Bill do I write a lot of error ?

Have a good day !

Fran=E7ois : Today I improve my axiom-run emacs mode.

I can also add that with modern dvi viewers which allow searching, I 
prefer to look directly into book.dvi. In fact, at present, axiom on my 
machine is an alias to "axiom -noht"...

>From my point of view, it is very useful to have an on line help which 
1) allows you to look for commands and packages which satisfy a certain 
pattern;
2) gives you the possibility to get on line extensive help (complete 
syntax, maybe some meaningful example, closely related functions, maybe 
the source package) of a command with something natural like
)? command
or
)help command

1) is present in axiom via ")ap pattern". It could be extended so that 
searches could be afforded also on small description of commands 
(something like the "apropos" command in Unix).

2), AFAIK, is only limited to ")di op command" and I must say that I don't 
find it very useful. For example ")di op extendedEuclidean" says there are 
2 functions, but it doesn't say anything else about them. As another 
example, I couldn't find any way to get on line a description of the 
syntax of "if" or the "for" loop.

On the other hand, very often a new user has often a (maybe even more 
than) basic knowledge of computer programming, so that he only needs very 
little to start using the software (that is, he only needs a sort of 
"Rosetta stone" on line).

As I said, from this point of view a good model could be Mathematica, or 
even Mupad: for example, compare the output of

MuPad  		|	Mathematica	|	Axiom
 		|			|
-------------------------------------------------------------------
 		|			|
?fibonacci 	|	?Fibonacci 	|	)di op fibonacci 
)if		|	?If		|	)di op if

and it should be clear what I mean.

How is this book related to book.dvi? And what about the other three which 
are planned?

this just runs a lisp command. write a lisp function that delivers the
help text you find useful and we can integrate it into the system easily.
you probably don't even need axiom loaded to write the command. most of
the information axiom knows comes from the databases. there is a standalone
program called 'asq' which knows how to look up answers in the databases.

help text for 'if', etc would have to be written which is the hard part.
making it work inside the system is easy.

Hello,
Assuming I get axiom running; would anybody be willing to discuss an
engineering application where I think Algebraic Geometry provides a
mathematically correct answer?
Even though I have just started learning AG, I think I can do all of the
hard work myself.

I would be very happy to discuss engineering applications of
algebraic geometry.

Perhaps one place to start with Axiom and algebraic geometry might be
the following tutorial by Donu Arapura (http://www.math.purdue.edu/~dvb):

http://www.math.purdue.edu/~dvb/algeom.html

Introduction to Algebraic Geometry

Arapura includes some computer examples using Maple. We could see how
we might do the same examples using Axiom.

Bill Page.

Thanks, I hadn't seen that page before.  It looks great.  I will print
out some the materials tomorrow, and practice with axiom when I get it
running.

The problem arises from autozeroing and good design; an error is set
equal to zero during autocalibration, and if the errors are zero the
first derivatives are designed out (more or less).  Thus the underlying
equations are made second order (and complicated) by design.

The concrete form of the problem is:
Err(x,a_i,b_k...)=P(x,a_i,b_k...)/Q(x,a_i,b_k...)  P&Q polynomials
Q has no zeros in the region of interest; and any poles can probably be
moved to infinity.
The first derivatives of Err(x,0,b_k..) with respect to a_i are all zero
(more or less),
and Err(0,a_i,b_k...)=0
These items are accomplished by autozero/autocalibrate.
The a_i are parameters, the b_k are errors in the parameters (expected
value of 0).
My simple solution is to use a constraint/boundary
c_1*a_1^2+c_2*a_2^2+....=p^2
and intersect the Err and the constraint and look for worst case error.

The p is introduced because to start out with a narrow space around the
center and grow to more reasonable value after the very local problem is
understood.

One way is to find grad(Err)=j*grad(constraint) term by term.
But it seems that this might be avoided if the constraint and Err
intersections are examined for second order roots (?).

Mentally it seems much simpler than it appears in writing.  I find the
more general problem interesting, but that seems to be a personal taste.

In any case, any guidance would be appreciated.

Ray

I too am (newly) interested in Algebraic Geometry
and would prefer to pursue that in Axiom or another
free CAS (rather than Maple) since this is only a
hobby interest for me.

>From the links you (so kindly) offered I also found
the following:

Macaulay2 Home Page http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/
  A software system devoted to supporting research
  in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.
  
Computations in algebraic geometry with Macaulay 2, 
 edited by David Eisenbud, Daniel R. Grayson, Michael
 E. Stillman, and Bernd Sturmfels.  Springer-Verlag
 September 25, ISBN 3-540-42230-7, $44.95. 
 http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Book/  (FREE DOWNLOAD)

In no way am I trying to move the discussion away

I think it is entirely appropriate to discuss Macaulay here.
In fact if there is continued interest, I would be very happy
to look into providing a web interface for Macaulay at the
Axiom Wiki, e.g.

  \begin{macaulay}
  R = QQ[x_1..x_4] 
  M = matrix{{x_1,x_2},{x_3,x_4}}
  D = det M
  T = trace M
  I = ideal {D, T}
  J = ideal M^2 
  radical I == radical J 
  \end{macaulay}

with the result displayed on the web page, along with Axiom
and Reduce.

I would yes to Algebraic Topology and not to Geometric Algebra -
although Geometrical is interesting in it's own right.

I think Algebraic Topology is formally related via category
theory, but the methods are very different.

Although the title of Penrose's book sounds overly grand, it is
none the less a very serious book on differential geometry as
applied to physics. I think your goal to better understand it is
very laudable. If there is anything in particular in this book
that you would like to discuss, I would be glad participate.
Maybe we can do some examples using Axiom?

Bill Page.

Hi!

It's possible to express the result of any operation between complex
numbers in binomial, exponential or another form?


I tried to resolve equations with float coefficients but I got a error
message:

   Cannot find a definition or applicable library operation named solve
     with argument type(s)
                         Equation Polynomial Float
                                  Float

How I can resolve it?

Thanks in advance!

Yes, it is (overly grand), much like a "wagon
train scout" of the pioneer days pulling out
a many-times-folded map of the route from St.
Louis to California and spending an evening
showing the settlers the things they need to
know to prepare for the trip.

> I think your goal to better understand it is
> very laudable. 

Or "overly grand". <grin>  Thanks for the 
encouragement -- it is much appreciated.

I have not yet reach page 200 and I have 
already learned an amazing amount.

> If there is anything in particular in this book

Please.  I want to discuss everything, but I
am probably not smart enough yet to figure out
how to ask a good question.

So far, I have been trying to learn Axiom & Maxima
in parallel with reading this book and have only
worked out some simple problems (like imaginary roots
and some differentials.)

I am a bit embarrassed to admit that I don't
really understand how much of the work Axiom
can do, nor really what the full capabilities
of Axiom include.

Even before this book I had entertained the 
belief that it might be possible to learn "a
lot of math" by following along through Calculus
and Differential Equations text -- learning to
the IDEAS, and letting the system do the tedious
portions.

This probably wouldn't be sufficient for a 
serious mathematician or engineer, but for me
this is just a (serious) hobby.

Perhaps seeing how to use Axiom to graph a
conformal map, or to work through a Fourier
transform would be interesting BUT this is 
merely the first thing that came to mind when
searching (desperately) for something to 
request -- please substitute ANYTHING your
prefer and I will ask for something else as
soon as I have the prerequisites.

I know even less of Macaulay, but believe that 
would be useful, and it certainly would be very
gracious of you.

Please note, that I am NOT modest about my abilities
nor about my intelligence, and any seeming "false
modesty" above is in fact just reality:  There is a
LOT of math covered in the book which I have not studied, 
and even my Calculus and Diff Eq is rusty and spotty
in places.

Also:  I have no particular preference for Maxima versus
Axiom, and so with your help I will focus more of my
attention on Axiom (and Macaulay2).

Both of these fine programs do more than I can currently
use.

Thanks,

I do not understand. What do you mean with "express a complex number in
binomial form"?

polarCoordinates returns argument and size of a complex float. Is this what you
are looking after?

Convert your floats into fractions.

This is NOT a bug report (nor certainly not a complaint),
but merely a preliminary request for info in case this
is an already solved problem:

I cannot run the Axiom Texmacs and the GUI (TexMacs
version of) Maxima at the same time.

Each will run, one at a time.

Most likely is an incompatibility of the DLL(s)
they load.

I have:

	axiom-windows-0.1.4.exe
	maxima-5.9.2.exe

...which I believe to be the latest RELEASED version
of each.

This is not even a giant problem since each seems to
run fine if it is started FIRST, i.e., one at a time.

This also has no effect on the command line version
of the other program.

I have no idea how hard it would be to get either of
them to use the TexMacs of the other or to find a
way to recompile them to the same (effective) version,
etc....

The best place to report such problems and ensure that they
are not "lost" is:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/IssueTracker

Fill-in the "Add a new issue" box at the bottom of the page.
Pick the appropriate category.

You can even include Axiom examples like this:

\begin{axiom}
F(s) =3D=3D (s**2 - 9*s - 32)/(2*s**3 - 3*s + 4)
inverseLaplace(F(s),s,x)
\end{axiom}

Herb,

If you haven't already, I think you should try sending a
copy of your email to the texmacs developer list:

http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/texmacs-dev

You might meet more people there who can answer your
question.

Let us know if the conclusion is a specific library or
other imcompatibility.

Be sure to point out that you are talking about the
Windows version of TeXmacs since Windows is a "secondary"
platform for TeXmacs and it might behavee quite differently
in linux.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Does anyone use and obtain graphics through the draw() command using texmac=
s
as an interface to axiom.   If so please tell me how you managed this.

I have heard that the following method works:

1. get texmacs souce
2. get tm_axiom.c
  alter this file so that if there exists a call to AXIOMsys
  change to axiom
3. compile tm_axiom.c
4. compile texmacs

if this or something similar is necessary please tell me
it would be great to get graphics working.

Also if anyone has been able to get inline graphics in
texmacs I would really like to know- this would be really
nice.

thanks for reading

Ok, thanks.

Before I do that I would like to understand better
what is supposed to be working (on Win32 without an
explicit CygWin install.)

I have installed Axiom and understand there is a
TexMacs included:  tm_axiom.exe

This runs if started first.  But I don't seem to
have (or perhaps understand) any connection between
Axiom and TexMacs.

Also when using draw commands (from the Axiom docs)
from within the Axiom command line I get socket 
errors which implies that some program should be 
setup perhaps as a "server" etc.

 (41) -> draw(f, 0..4)
    Graph data being transmitted to the viewport manager...
 
    >> System error:
    SOCK-SEND-INT is invalid as a function.

 protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
 (41) ->

Maybe there is a doc I missed for installing Axiom
and getting it to work with (the included) TexMacs
or for creating Graphics....

Herb,

The message you are getting

    SOCK-SEND-INT is invalid as a function.

means that the axiom C library is not linked into the AXIOMsys image.

'axiom' is actually a shell script. it invokes 'sman' (superman)
which starts several processes hyperdoc, the browser ; clef, the
command line editor function ; AXIOMsys, the actual axiom interpreter ;
and viewman which handles 2D and 3D graphics.

sman communicates over sockets to these processes and the axiom
interpreter uses SOCK-SEND-INT to send integers. it appears that
your AXIOMsys does not have the C routines linked in. this is odd
as the second step of the build process is to compile the C code
and the third step is to build GCL and link it into the image.

i'm not sure what the details are of the texmacs connection
but if it starts AXIOMsys directly then there won't be an sman
process running so graphics will not work. the easiest test for
that case is to see if the axiom browser starts when you start
axiom from texmacs. if not then the texmacs interface is probably
only running the AXIOMsys image.

Is that for the Windows version of Axiom?

When I try to run tm_axiom (which I thought
was runable before) it gives this:

E:\dev\axiom\mnt\windows\bin>tm_axiom
=E2=98=BBverbatim:=E2=98=BBchannel:prompt=E2=99=A3=E2=98=BBlatex:\red$\ri=

(I added <ENTER> to show that I pressed Enter there.)

Thanks for trying to help me -- I appreciate it --
this probably doesn't apply to me though, since I am
running on a Windows box (and running without an
explicit install of Cygwin) so "shell scripts"
don't run here.

I downloaded and installed this:

	axiom-windows-0.1.4.exe

There doesn't seem to be any equivalent batch file
either.  The installation program installed shortcuts
that point directly to axiomsys and I have to start
TexMacs (tm_axiom.exe) separately.

There doesn't even seem to be any sman.exe included.

[No bat or cmd files in my Axiom directory tree;
there are a bunch of bat files in my separately
downloaded (and apparently incompatible) WinTexMacs
directory, but they all seem to be within the ghostscript
subtree.]

This makes sense and likely something similar was intended
for the pre-compiled Windows version (i.e., I didn't compile
this locally, it was downloaded as-is.)

Thanks for any light you can shed on this;
or pointers to docs or people who can help
with the Windows (Win32) version of Axiom.

I have no problem with "read the manual" answers
if someone knows the manual in question....<grin>

?? What runs? You mean tm_axiom.exe? That is not supposed
to be run by you. It is internal to TeXmacs. tm_axiom is
the process that interfaces between TeXmacs and Axiom. It
handles all communications in both directions.

If you have tm_axiom.exe installed in the right location
(See: http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/TeXmacs ), then inside
TeXmacs you should be able to choose Axiom from the Session
menu. When you do this, TeXmacs starts tm_axiom.exe and in
turn tm_axiom.exe starts AXIOMsys (the main Axiom process).
(All this is normally invisible to you, as a user.)

The Axiom commands that you enter into TeXmacs after the
red -> prompt are sent via tm_axiom.exe to AXIOMsys. Axiom
calculates a result and generates a LaTeX expression as
output. This is expression is sent back to tm_axiom which
folds the LaTeX output to conform to the page size and then
tm_axiom.exe sends it TeXmacs. TeXmacs converts the LaTeX
expressions to it's internal form and displays the result
inside the document.

Yes. :) The Axiom Wiki web site has a lot of useful information
(although admittedly of uneven quality and some a little out of
date already ... :(

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/55GraphicsDoesNotWorkOnWindows
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomGraphics
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/TeXmacs

Unfortunately Axiom graphics is not yet available on Windows.

Yes that is the situation in the current Windows version of Axiom.
This functionality had to be removed from the Windows version
because the Windows support for sockets is quite different than
on linux/unix.

Currently only AXIOMsys runs on Windows although recently Tim
Daly did manage to get hyperdoc running in standalone mode in
Windows (this is still very experimental).

No. This does not currently apply to Windows.

Normally the texmacs interface only runs AXIOMsys since the only
Axiom output that can be handled by the interface is the LaTeX
output from AXIOMsys (older versions used to run the axiom shell
script).

On linux some people have modified the texmacs interface to call
the axiom shell script. This allows you to enter draw commands
in TeXmacs, however the graphical output only appears in a separate
Axiom graphics windows. But from there, the output can be saved as
a postscript file and manually imported into TeXmacs. Of course
this does not current work in the Windows version of Axiom.

Hello Tim,

2006/1/25, root <daly@axiom-developer.org>:

If the TeXmacs plugin for Axiom has been kept in the same state as I
left it, this plugin starts AXIOMsys directly.

Best wishes,
d.

Hello,

2006/1/25, Herb Martin <HerbM@learnquick.com>:
> Is that for the Windows version of Axiom?

I've never tested Axiom and TeXmacs under windows. I think Bill Page had.


> When I try to run tm_axiom (which I thought

tm_axiom plugin should be started transparently by TeXmacs, when you
start an Axiom session from TeXmacs menu (and if TeXmacs detects you
have Axiom installed, which might be the tricky thing that blocks
you).

Sorry but I can't help you much more, I've haven't hacked on Axiom
neither TeXmacs code for years.

Best wishes,
d.

It's for the linux version (graphic and hyperdoc
are not available on windows).

Yes. There is a modified version to tm_axiom for Windows based
directly on Andrey's original program but using a more efficient
(for Windows) threaded programming technique.

What you are seeing is the internal communication protocol between
tm_axiom.exe and TeXmacs  (complete with embedded binary codes).
This is not a program that would normally be run by the user.

tm_axiom.exe is **not** TeXmacs! You need to install
TeXmacs separately. See:

http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/download/windows.en.html

There is more information about the TeXmacs interface for
Axiom and specifically Axiom on Windows here:

Why do you say they are "apparently incompatible"? WinTeXmacs
should work wint Axiom for Windows "right out of the box".

No, this is not done at all in the current Windows build of Axiom.

No. Niether the pre-compiled nor the current Windows sources
for Axiom support sockets via the old Axiom-specific code.
There is some (experimental) support for native GCL socket
support, but this is not used by Axiom.

Well as I said previously, the Axiom website

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

has a lot of "answers". If you find places where it is deficient,
please feel free to add additional information - this is a
community-run wiki (editable website).

Sure. I just modified it at one point to make it work with Axiom (and I
particularly remember modifying it, relatively to the axiom/AXIOMsys
difference). I Don't know which plugin code have been integrated in
TeXmacs and/or Axiom though. :-)

I did not want to steal Andrey's credits or yours.

Best wishes and sorry for the misunderstanding,
d.

Yes. I recall that. The issue was the running 'axiom' starts
sman which starts AXIOMsys (which generates one 1) -> prompt)
and then asks Axiom to start a new frame (which generates another
1) -> prompt). The original Axiom plugin of TeXmacs expected
this behaviour. When we changed to just calling AXIOMsys (which
is all that is available on Windows), then the tm_axiom interface
program had to change.

I think your modified version is used with the Linux version of
TeXmacs, which the new "threaded" version of tm_axiom is used
on Windows.

No problem! :) Thanks for the clarification.

Ok, I was confused about this part, but I had already
installed TexMacs according to that page.

	wintexmacs-1.0.5.exe

This page seemed to indicate this...

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/TeXmacs

...but on re-reading it, now it seems to say that
tm_axiom is:

"A new version of the Axiom interface program 
tm_axiom that was written especially for Windows 
is included in the latest Axiom for Windows 
installation program. This will be used 
automatically by the native windows version of 
TeXmacs."

I took "interface program" to mean that which
will display the output (i.e., what TexMacs
presumably does) and apparently (now) it really
means "the program that TexMacs talks to..."

Or else there is NO connection between TexMacs
and Axiom (except through manual transfer)?????

On an old message there was a statement that said
that the drawing did NOT work on Windows -- is this
still true?  NO drawing?

This page indicates that TexMacs can use Axiom and
a variety of other programs as "plug-ins": 
http://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/plugins/cas.en.html#axiom

Likely I haven't done whatever is necessary to hook up
TexMacs to Axiom -- or else I misunstand what they
do together.

In general, I was expecting something like the Windows
version of Maxima-TeXmacs.  It this completely wrong?

I think it is (only) the TexMacs stand-alone
load that is incompatible with the Maxima built-in
TexMacs (likely one of the required DLLs is using
the same name but a different version.)

As far as I know, no one has done this. Certainly it is technically
possible, though perhaps a little difficult because of the way
Axiom uses another process to render graphics. This external graphics
processor can be told to save the result in a postscript format
file, then it can be imported by TeXmacs or sent via a stream
to TeXmacs from the tm_axiom interface program.

If you are motivated to work on implementing a solution to this,
I would be glad to help.

> thanks for reading

Thanks for asking :) If you can think of a way of updating the
web page at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/TeXmacs

so that this issue is more clearly documented, I would be very
happy if you (or anyone else) could improve the content. (This
web site is an Axiom community wiki - editable website.)

We talked some day ago about hyperdoc and its crashes. I realized that 
most of the crashes I experienced were in the browse section: if I enter 
some search text and then I click either "Documentation" or "Complete" 
then Hyperdoc crashes and I get the following error in axiom:

    >> System error:
    Cannot open the file /usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/algebra/libdb.text.

On the other hand, other types of search works.

So it seems that I am missing this file and, in fact, I have no *.text in 
my axiom directory. Yet, when I compiled it, compilation reported no 
errors.

This is a known problem. See issue #153:

property change --Tim Daly, Sun, 30 Oct 2005 13:13:03 -0600 reply

I have verified that this problem no longer occurs in Axiom built
from the most recent tla developer archive. I am not sure if this
is in the CVS versions yet. However if you have built Axiom from
an earlier source you can copy the required file as loli described
in the above issue report.

  cp .../axiom/int/algebra/libdb.text \
     /usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/algebra/libdb.text

where .../axiom stands for your Axiom source directory.

If you did not build Axiom from source, e.g. if you installed a
binary version, then you can download it from here:

  cd /usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/algebra
  wget http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/mnt/linux/algebra/libdb.text

This solves the failures related to "Complete", etc. however the
problem described in issue #236

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/236ClickingOnDependentsInHyperDocBrowseCr=
ash
esHyperDoc

still occurs. If you find other such cases, please submit an=20
issue report at:

Yes, that is correct. The information flow looks like
this:

   TeXmacs  <---> tm_axiom <---> AXIOMsys

tm_axiom is a two-way translator (interface) that
converts to/from TeXmacs compatible input/output
from/to Axiom. When you start an Axiom session in
TeXmacs, TeXmacs runs tm_axiom. tm_axiom in turn
runs AXIOMsys. These three processes are running
on your system when you interact with Axiom via
TeXmacs.

Could you suggest a revision to the text on the above
web page that would make this more clear?

The connection is automatic but slightly indirect.

NO drawing on Windows :(

The problem is that Axiom's graphics package depends on
the Xwindows environment which is not available on native
Windows.

Xwindows is available under Cygwin on Windows and in principle
the graphics and hyperdoc parts of Axiom could run in this
environment but right now we do not have an official build
for Cygwin. Further, the version of Axiom for Windows does
not have the same socket functionality as the version for
Linux (due to limitations in the underlying lisp - GCL).

But some progress has been made recently. Tim Daly was able
to compile (using Cygwin) and run a stand alone version of
hyperdoc (in native windows with a native windows Xserver).
This is still very experimental but in principle would also
allow Axiom graphics to run in native mode Windows (i.e.
without installing Cygwin) once the socket issue is resolved.

This is exactly what you should get if everything is
installed properly. On Windows everything works best if
you install Axiom first and WinTeXmacs second - that way
WinTeXmacs will "see" Axiom and setup the necessary
configuration.

But the Axiom plug-in for TeXmacs is not quite as
sophisticated as the most recent version of the plug-in
for Maxima. For example, it is not possible to use "2-d"
math input for Axiom, you are limited to entering
traditional Axiom commands.

Could you please describe this again very carefully, i.e.
step-by-step? I do not understand what you mean by:
"Maxima built-in TexMacs". Maxima is not built-in to
TeXmacs. It works that same way as Axiom and TeXmacs
except the most recent version of Maxima no longer needs
an intermediate interface program like tm_axiom.

I believe I followed the directions given bellow.  The only problem with
this tm_axiom is that I don't get output except for graphics.  That is:
first prompt 
-> x
-> 
i.e. next line is a new prompt with no output?
The good news is that draw() does work
-> draw(x,x=0..5) 
produces the Axiom graphic panel.

If you have time attached is my altered tm_axiom.c file.  

Best,
Yigal Weinstein
------------------------------------------------------------------
TeXmacs --Andrey, Wed, 12 Oct 2005 03:49:57 -0500 reply It is easy to
modify tm_axiom.c to start axiom (with hypertex and graphics) 

Instead of starting AXIOMsys, it should start axiom -noclef

Also, in void session(void), declare:

  int prompts=0;

and, a few lines later, replace the line:

  else if (code==PROMPT) break;

by the line:

  else if (code==PROMPT) { if ((++prompts)==2) break; }

However, it would be much better to fix this damn double-prompt problem
once and for all. Axiom must not write a prompt when it is not prompting
the user to input something.

Your modifications look fine and they work for me. The new
tm_axiom.c file compiles and installs with no errors:

  1) copy altered tm_axiom.c file into

     cp tm_axiom.c ~/TeXmacs-1.0.6-src/plugins/axiom/src

  2) compile

     cd ~/TeXmacs-1.0.6-src/plugins/axiom
     make

  3) install new file

     sux -c 'cp bin/tm_axiom /usr/local/libexec/TeXmacs/bin'

Did you do something similar to this?

--------

When I run 'texmacs' and Insert/Session/Axiom, I see the
red -> prompt plus an Axiom Hypertex window appears (which
I ignore).

I can enter

  -> x

and I see

     x                                          (1)

                                  Type: Variable x

When I enter

  -> draw(x,x=0..5)

an Axiom graphics window opens with the graph and the
following Axiom output appears in TeXmacs:

  Compiling /tmp/gazonk0.lsp
  End of Pass 1
  End of Pass 2
  OPTIMIZE levels ...
  Finished compiling ...
    Compiling function %B ...
    Graph data being transmitted ...

                   Type: TwoDimensionalViewport

  ->

-------

I can enter additional Axiom commands with no problem.

I can save the graph as a file by clicking on the graph
and then clicking the PS button.

In TeXmacs I can click Insert/Image/Insert Image
and select 'axiom2d.ps' and the image appears in the
TeXmacs document.

-------

Note: To get rid of the Hypertex window you can change
the line that starts axiom in tm_axiom.c to:

  execlp("axiom","axiom","-noclef","-noht",0);

-------

If you are still having problems, could you please
describe in more detail your steps and the specific
output that you see?

What versions of Axiom and TeXmacs are you using?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Is there a way in Axiom >= 3.9 to get a numerical approximation for
Gamma(x,y)- without the use of NAG?  I know there is for Gamma(x) but
for incomplete gamma there seems no straightforward way.

I suggest that someone tackle this problem based on the following
article:

http://www.theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de/~serge/papers/Winitzki_2003_Com=
put
ing_the_incomplete_Gamma_function_to_arbitrary_precision_LNCS_2667.pdf

Computing the incomplete Gamma function to arbitrary precision

Serge Winitzki1
Department of Physics, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Theresienstr. 37,
80333
Munich, Germany (serge@theorie.physik.uni-muenchen.de)

Abstract. I consider an arbitrary-precision computation of the
incomplete Gamma function from the Legendre continued fraction.
Using the method of generating functions, I compute the convergence
rate of the continued fraction and find a direct estimate of the
necessary number of terms. This allows to compare the performance
of the continued fraction and of the power series methods. As an
application, I show that the incomplete Gamma function Gamma(a, z)
can be computed to P digits in at most O (P) long multiplications
uniformly in z for Re z > 0. The error function of the real argument,
erf x, requires at most O(P2/3) long multiplications.

I would be glad to help someone with the SPAD coding.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yes, I didn't realize the power of Axiom, I simply made the function,

gamma(n,x) == factorial(n-1)*exp(-x)*reduce(+,[x^i/factorial(i) for i in
0..(n-1)])

which was adapted from the example function in the book,

f(n) == reduce(*,[i for i in 2..n])

sorry for the lame question I am just beginning to use Axiom and best,

Yigal

I would like to say that its great to find theory and tools that really
work.  I wrote my optimization/tolerance analysis program in about 5
lines and it works, giving answers that I as an Engineer need.  I did it
the crude way, but simplicity is nice.
Small problem, when I ran the real problem I ran out of memory and
haven't been able to find information about the "allocation" command; I
haven't received my book yet.  Could somebody point me to the right place.

:) I am glad you find it useful... we need more tesimonals like
that!

I am afraid you wont find much in any of the Axiom documentation
about memory allocation. :(

But if the error message that you get when you "ran out of
memory" was similar to:

    >> System error:
    Contiguous blocks exhausted.
  Currently, 1354 pages are allocated.
  Use ALLOCATE-CONTIGUOUS-PAGES to expand the space.

then maybe you can try for example:

  (1) -> )lisp (si::allocate-contiguous-pages 3000 t)

See for example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxCategoryOfGraphs

Memory allocation is primarily controlled by the underlying
GCL lisp environment. Unfortunately the specific details of
the memory allocation in GCL are beyond me. Camm Macquire
is the main GCL developer. I have some notes from him back
in September with more details of GCL memory allocation when
I was trying to debug the above problem. If you get deeply into
this, I can copy these to you.

The most significant defaults are set during the compilation
of GCL as part of the overall Axiom build. If you are building
Axiom from source, you might be able to modify the GCLOPTS to
specify larger limits.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I don't think your question was "lame" at all. The evaluation
of the incommplete Gamma function as a floating point value is
something that *should* be built in to Axiom.

In general I think even Axiom's treatment of Gamma is a little
"uneven". In fact the whole area of special functions in Axiom
is due for a major overhaul... See for example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/6WrongIntegrationResult
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/130SpecialFunctionIntegerDoesntReturnExpr=
ess
ionInteger

Anyway, here is another "one-liner" for Gamma, more or less
equivalent to the function you wrote, which illustrates some
of the other "power" of Axiom:

gamma2(a,z) =3D=3D
  integrate(exp(-t)*t^(a-1),
  t=3D(z::POLY FRAC INT)..%plusInfinity)::Expression Float

Regards,
Bill Page.

I am trying to use a continued fraction representation for the
incomplete gamma function gamma(x,y) with mixed success.  Does anyone
know why this error is obtained:

  >> Error detected within library code:
   Denominators must be greater than 0.

For this code:

num:=cons(1,[i^2 for i in 1..])
den:=cons(2,[-2*i for i in 2..])
continuedFraction(0,num,den)

(This is known as Gompertz constant and is equal to gamma(0,1))

It is true that the denominator has the negative sequence [-2*i for i in
2..] in it and that changing the - to a plus i.e. 

num:=cons(1,[i^2 for i in 1..])
den:=cons(2,[2*i for i in 2..])
continuedFraction(0,num,den)

results in 
   (26)
       1 |     1 |     4 |     9 |     16 |     25 |     36 |      |
|
     +---+ + +---+ + +---+ + +---+ + +----+ + +----+ + +----+ + ...
     | 2     | 4     | 6     | 8     | 10     | 12     | 14       
                                      Type: ContinuedFraction Integer

A perfectly good continued fraction although nothing I can actually use.
Is there a way for Axiom to use the first code.  

I created today a code that uses both positive numerators and
denominators, it works for gamma(0,x), x>0 but converges slowly, it is
also very poorly coded as I am a true newbie to Axiom.  I don't know how
to efficiently create an alternating sequence.

)clear all 
x:Float;x:=1.0
a:Integer;a:=0
n : (Integer) -> List Polynomial Float;
n(y) == [1,y-a]@List Polynomial Float;
--
-- alternating generator for numerator

num := [numg.i.i for i in 1..]
den := [deng.i.i for i in 1..]
cf := continuedFraction(0,num,den)
ccf := convergents cf
-- bellow is the approximation to gamma(a,x) 
gam(i) == exp(-x)*x^a*ccf.i; 

Thank you for reading,

gamma(n,x) == factorial(n-1)*exp(-x)*reduce(+,[x^i/factorial(i) for i in

where
gam.15 = 0.1836881970 165365277
gamma(7,20.)=0.1836881970 165365277

thank you all for your previous help,

Vigal,

Could you write up some documentation of that function?
We could name it and include it but I'm pressing hard for
good, complete documentation from the authors so that someone
30 years from now has a clue. If the original function you
tried to use was documented well you might have been able to
generalize it. Please consider writing a quality piece of
math documentation to explain it.

Tim

After a couple hours of tinkering the incomplete gamma function has
taken on a simpler and more useful form.  Is there an easier way of
making an alternating sequence, i.e. a sequence of the form:
(a1,b1,a2,b2,...).  

)clear all 
j:=20
n(i,a) == [i-1,i-a];
numg(1,a)== [1,1-a];
numg(i|i>1,a) == append(numg(i-1,a),n(i,a));
d(i,x) == [x,1]; 
deng(1,x)== [x,1];
deng(i|i>1,x) == append(deng(i-1,x),d(i,x));  
num(a) == [numg(i,a).i for i in 1..];
den(x) == [deng(i,x).i for i in 1..];
cf(a,x) == continuedFraction(0,num(a),den(x));
ccf(a,x) == convergents cf(a,x);
gam(a,x) == exp(-x)*x^a*ccf(a,x).j;
--
-- a test
gamma(a,x) == factorial(a-1)*exp(-x)*reduce(+,[x^i/factorial(i) for i in
0..(a-1)]); 
gam(7.0,20.0)
gamma(7,20.0)

Thanks,

The even parts of the continued fraction do work after specifying that
all numbers should be converted to floats.  So here is my latest rewrite
of the incomplete gamma function,

)clear all 
j:=120
nume(a) == cons(1 :: Float,[((a-i)*i) :: Float for i in 1..]);
dene(a,x) == [(x+2*i+1-a) :: Float for i in 0..];
cfe(a,x) == continuedFraction(0,nume(a),dene(a,x));
ccfe(a,x) == convergents cfe(a,x);
gamcfe(a,x) == exp(-x)*x^a*ccfe(a,x).j;


(24) -> gamcfe(0.0,1.0)*exp(1.0)
(24) ->
   (24)  0.5963473623 2319407232
                                              Type: Fraction Float

The form is not so good yet but it is better and a lot less taxing on
the eyes then previous versions.

Best,

Yigal

Please see:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxGamma

This implements exactly the algorithm of Recipes eq. (6.27)
It uses a good numerical method (Lentz) for evaluating the
continued fraction.

I would like to talk to you so more about your use of Axiom's
ContinuedFraction domain. I think this is interesting for a
very different reason than just evaluating the incomplete
Gamma function. Continued fractions (especially as implemented
here in Axiom as "infinite" streams) is one of the better
methods for implement **exact** real arithmetic. But maybe
that is a subject for another day.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Of course that is just the limiting case... easy to handle.
See revision:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxGamma

Now, really this routine needs to be written in SPAD since we
don't really want to have two different namess for Gamma - one
for the symbolic case and one for the numeric. We want

  Gamma(1,2) to be Type: Expression Integer

but

  Gamma(1,2)::Expression Float

to return a floating point value. This is quite easy in SPAD.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hello Bill, and others !

>=20
> Comments from everyone would be most welcome.
>=20=20
So I take some time to explain my point of view as a former mupad user.

You show 2 problems which causes axiom-source difficult to read :

// A //

> A bigger issue seems to me to be the way Gamma(x) is currently
> impletement in Axiom. I was a little horrified to see that it
> is actually implemented in BOOT code. Horrified because while
> BOOT is (nearly) as readable as SPAD, it is much closer to the
> machine level and therefore correspondingly harder to debug.
> In my opinion BOOT has it's place at the deeper levels of the
> Axiom interpreter and the SPAD compiler itself, but I think this
> is completely unnecessary when it comes to Algebra code.

When I want to understand a function I make a lot of grep on *.spad files
in order to find some interessing lines.=20
I really do this for the sin function.
I don't imagine that I must read the boot-loader for the gamma function.

The mupad file are in trees ; all files have the same structure.
I send the skeleton of the main igamma function in mupad lib.

There are sin.mu, gamma.mu, igamma.mu, Ei.mu files in the SPECFUNC director=
y.
There are also some igamma implentation in=20
STDLIB/DIFF/igamma.mu for differential computation
STDLIB/CONJ/igamma.mu for conjugate
SERIES/igamma.mu      for series
...

// B //=20

> The second thing is that I do not like the way that the special
> functions have been implemented as part of the DoubleFloat

> (as one might do in the case of symbolic integration etc.) and
> when to treat it numerically.

When I use axiom I ask (to me) the question :
<< how can I explain this idea (to my students) with very view words >>
And I see it's not so easy to do with Float, Expression Float, DoubleFloat :

> For example:
>=20
sin(1) :                   sin(1)             Type: Expression Integer
sin(1)::Expression Float                      Right
(sin 1)::Float                                Wrong, Why ?
(2/3)::Float=20
Gamma(1)                                      Type: DoubleFloat
                                              I prefer Integer
Gamma(1,2)                                    Expression Integer is right.

> I don't think there should be this difference in behaviour

     "igamma -- the incomplete Gamma function [try ?igamma for details]"):
igamma:=3D slot(igamma, "conjugate",
    loadproc(slot(igamma,"conjugate"),pathname("STDLIB","CONJ"),"igamma")):
igamma:=3D slot(igamma, "diff",
    loadproc(slot(igamma,"diff"),pathname("STDLIB","DIFF"),"igamma")):
....
// end of file=20

I hope you understand the point of view of an axiom end-user.
