Constantine,
 
I picked up a copy of matlab and one of the books. 
I'll try installing it later this week and then I can
help you with your translation problems. I'm not familiar
with Matlab.

Matlab seems, at first reading, to be somewhat primitive but
perhaps I'm missing the point. In any case it clearly provides
functionality that the student needs in some easy to use form.

Perhaps we can learn some lessons from it and create a "matlab
compatibility package" that covers the functions in ways that
a matlab user can understand.

Tim

5 December 2004

Dear Colleagues,
 
     I have started slowly translating my Matlab programs to axiom, and
     am experiencing some difficulties. The type system of axiom is
     very advanced. However, its not clear to me at this stage
     how to implement in axiom certain basic operations that I can
     implement relatively easily in Matlab. I have written a test program
     file test.input with some questions (as comments) and pasted this
 below. 
     You can  run this in axiom with: )read test.input;
 
 
 
 --Test program file test.input for basic manipulations.
 --qi, i=1,..,n=3 are the generalized co-ordinates (functions of time t),
 --and pi = derivative of qi wrt to time t, i=1,..,n=3.
 
 
 --In Matlab it is possible to "convert" strings to symbolic variables
 --as follows: n=3; qt = sym(zeros(n,1)); pt = sym(zeros(n,1)); 
 --for i=1:n, qt(i)=sym(['q',int2str(i),'(t)']); 
 --pt(i) = sym(['p',int2str(i),'(t)']); end;
 
-- IS THERE A WAY OF DOING THE ABOVE IN AXIOM ??? So far I could only
--find  the following method.
 
 q1:=operator 'q1
 q2:=operator 'q2
 q3:=operator 'q3
 
 p1:=operator 'p1
 p2:=operator 'p2
 p3:=operator 'p3
 
 gt := q1(t)*q1(t) + p1(t)*sin(q2(t)) + p2(t)*cos(q3(t)) + p3(t)
 
 dgtdt:= D(gt,t)
 
 
 dgtdt := (rule D(q1(t),t) == p1(t)) dgtdt;
 dgtdt := (rule D(q2(t),t) == p2(t)) dgtdt;
 dgtdt := (rule D(q3(t),t) == p3(t)) dgtdt
 
 
 --I want to "supress the t" in the expression gt and
 --obtain: g = q1*q1 + p1*sin(q2) + p2*cos(q3) + p3.
 --Then take the derivative of g wrt the qi's, and pi's, i=1,..,n=3.
 
 --In Matlab I do this as follows: 
 --q = sym(zeros(n,1)); p = sym(zeros(n,1)); 
 --for i=1:n, q(i)=sym(['q',int2str(i)]); p(i) = sym(['p',int2str(i)]);
--end;
 --g = subs(g,qt,q); g = subs(g,pt,p);
 
 --IS THERE A WAY OF DOING THE ABOVE IN AXIOM ??? So far I could only find
 --the following method. 
 
 
 g := (rule (q1(t) == qw1; q2(t) == qw2; q3(t) == qw3; p1(t) == pw1; p2(t)
== pw2; p3(t) == pw3))gt
 
 dgdqw1 := D(g,qw1)
 dgdqw2 := D(g,qw2)
 dgdqw3 := D(g,qw3)
 
 dgdpw1 := D(g,pw1)
 dgdpw2 := D(g,pw2)
 dgdpw3 := D(g,pw3)
 
 --end of program.


Thanks very much.

C. Frangos.

Dear Constantine Frangos,

Only guessing...

I think that it is correct to use "operator" for q_i and p_i. If you want to
create them with a loop, you can say

qs:=[operator subscript('q, [i::OutputForm]) for i in 1..3]
ps:=[operator subscript('p, [i::OutputForm]) for i in 1..3]

which you can access using qs.i and ps.i now. Unfortunately, there seems to be
a bug that messes up the interpretation of (qs.1)(2*t). A workaround is to say

eval((qs.1)(s),s=(2*t))

To teach Axiom that x' = y, you can use

x:=operator('x,1)
y:=operator('y,1)
derivative(x,(t+->y(t))::(EXPR INT->EXPR INT))$BasicOperatorFunctions1(EXPR INT)

The second argument to operator telling Axiom the arity of the operator, is
optional.

Unfortunately, I can't get the obvious 

[derivative(qs.i,(t+->(ps.i)(t))::(EXPR INT->EXPR INT))$BOP1(EXPR INT) 
 for i in 1..3]

to work. 

Most unfortunately, I can't think right away of a way to tell Axiom to
differentiate with respect to an operator. However, it seems to me that there
is also some maths involved. Surely, you also want to be able to differentiate
p1(2t) with respect to p1?

Martin

(I'm forwarding this also to axiom-math, since I believe that it is of general
interest. I hope I'm not disturbing privacy)

As far as I know, factor has no (or not much) effect on fields, and EXPR INT is
one. In fact, this is a topic that should go on mathaction. To find out about
various factorisation operations you can try

)di op fact

giving you all operations that contain "fact" in their names. After that you
can inspect promising ones --- find out where they are defined with -- for
example --

grep "sqfrFactor.*==" *.spad

in the algebra/src directory, and then: read the source. It is often very well
documented.

There are also various trig operations:

)di op trig

Sorry, I don't know much more at the moment. Maxima has a command "trigrat"
that works well. Maybe Axiom needs some work here. It would be great if you
document your findings on MathAction!

I'm not sure what's the problem. Maybe you want a .input file containing

)read funs1.input
)read funs2.input
...

?

If your operations are reusable, you might prefer "packages". These group
together operations that work for any domain in a specified category. If you
are interested, I'll expand.

True.

Good luck,

Martin

PS: what's your scientific domain?

In answer to a previous question of a similar nature on the
axiom-user list:

http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mathematics.axiom.general/16

There are some simple example pdf and TeXmacs (tm) files here.

http://www.linux-france.org/~dmentre/axiom/doc/axiom_texmacs.pkg/Examples%20
v1.0.2/

The tm files can be used directly with Axiom through the
tm_axiom interface. See

That is a peculiar presumption. Does anyone expect privacy
on a public mailing list? :) I think it is perfectly ok
to ask such questions here (and there).

 WE NEED MORE QUESTIONS.

Dear Constantine,

1. Please send your questions to axiom-math. I'll get them, don't worry.

2.

 > Please send me some examples of functions defined in separate files, etc.
 > The documentation does not seem to be clear on this topic and some concrete
 > examples would be very helpful.

Hm. This depends what you want. If you want .input files, I'm of no help
here. Only: .input files are simply interpreted, just as you would type your
commands at the prompt.

If you want .spad files, i.e., if you want to write packages, domains or
categories, these are compiled, and indeed, the axiom book is a little short in
this regard.

It would be very helpful if you gave an example of what you want to
achieve. Something like: I want a function, that given this and that produces
this and that. Another function does this and the third one that.

yes. I suppose you can also write

I don't think so.

A package look as follows:

)abbrev package TEST TestThisAndThat
--- this tells the compiler that TEST is the abbrevation of TestThisAndThat
--- (it is compulsory to give such an abbreviation)
--- and that you are going to define a package (not a domain, not a category)

TestThisAndThat(R:IntegralDomain): Exports == Implementation where
--- here you tell the compiler, that the package is about integral domains.
--- This "parametrization" is what makes packages interesting.


    Exports == with
      double: R -> R
--- this is a function from R to R. Note that R may be *any* integral domain
--- this is the "public" part

    Implementation == add
      double p == 2*p
--- here we define the function. We have to make sure that we only use
--- operations that are available for *any* integral domain
--- this is the "private" part.

Is this something you want to use?

Martin

I worked out how to program the indexed operators stuff, see below. Also, I'd
like to supplement something I called a bug before:

Given

qs:=[operator(subscript('q, [i::OutputForm])::Symbol) for i in 1..3]

I said, that

(qs.1(2*t) 

does not work.

(qs.1)(2*t::EXPR INT)

does, however.

Here is the promised code for indexed operators and setting their derivatives:

)abbrev package TEST Test
Test(): Exports == Implementation where
    EI == Expression Integer

    Exports == with
      tst: () -> EI

    Implementation == add
      tst () ==
        qs:=[operator(subscript('q, [i::OutputForm])::Symbol) for i in 1..3]
        ps:=[operator(subscript('p, [i::OutputForm])::Symbol) for i in 1..3]
        for i in 1..3 repeat
          derivative((qs.i)::BasicOperator,(ps.i)(#1))$BasicOperatorFunctions1(EI)
        
        var:=t::Symbol::EI
	D((qs.1)(2*var)+(qs.2)(var),t::Symbol)

*,

We are beginning to plan an Axiom conference for April 22, 2004.
The conference is a one-day, four speaker affair with a target
audience of the general scientific user. The idea is to highlight
the uses and usefulness of Axiom in various scientific areas.

At the momment this is still in the discussion stage and virtually
nothing has been finalized, including the potential speaker list.
The only known features are that it will occur on the given date
and be hosted at City College of New York (my home campus).

I'm giving everyone a chance for early input, including suggestions
for speakers you'd like to hear, topics you'd like covered, and work
you might like to present. We want to show engage the general 
scientific community.

Please send comments directly to daly@idsi.net rather than these lists.

Bill,

I'm copying the developer mailing list because I think you
have a good idea although I'm not sure how many might be interested.

>My first reaction is that one day is too short unless you
>intend this to be primarily a "local promotional affair".
>I think many people would find the cost and inconvenience of

>this is connected with some other related conference at the
>same venue.

Actually, the axiom conference will follow on the heels of a
group theory conference which I'm also helping to organize.
However these are currently disjoint audiences (until I get
the group theory algebra moved into axiom).

>I think that at least two days is a minimum. And I have some

I ran this by the CAISS Director (Gilbert Baumslag, my boss)
and he thinks it is a good idea if there is sufficient interest.

The "sprint" is a very appealing idea. We have a lab with about 20
machines over which I have complete control. It would be very
productive (and from my point of view a huge amount of fun) to get a
group of developers together. I know we manage to make progress now
but it would be so much more productive to have many eyes on problems
at the same location. Plus we could have a good discussion of future
directions, additional algebra, etc.

So is there any interest in either or both of these ideas
(a two-day vs one-day conference, a 'sprint' meeting)?

12 November 2004

Dear Colleagues,

I have pasted below two files: expandsincos.input and testkinemat1.input. 

Any assistance with the following will be appreciated:


(1) I am trying to read expandsincos.input from within
    testkinemat1.input but this gives an error. Not clear why ??

(2) What worked is to execute from the command line:

    )read expandsincos.input
    )read testkinemat1.input

    However, there does not seem to be much simplification.

(3) I tried to write the script testkinemat1.input like a function
    without input or output variables (see below) but this gave
    errors. Not clear why ??

(4) Any examples of how to write user functions calling other user
    functions, etc would be much appreciated. Especially the case
    where a function can return multiple variables eg. in matlab: 

    [x1,x2,x3] = func1(y1,y2,y3);

    In view of the errors in (1), (3) above, its not clear how the "reading
in" of
    .input files should be done. 

(5) In axiom what is the instruction to "pause" after the execution of
    a line, and continue after hitting enter ? eg in matlab: 
    a = 1 
    pause; 
    b = 3 
    pause;



-- expandsincos.input
-- Basic trigonometric expansion rules for axiom.
--cos(2*x) == cos(x)**2 - sin(x)**2

expandsincos := rule ( sin(x+y) == sin(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*cos(x); cos(x+y)
== cos(x)*cos(y) - sin(x)*sin(y); sin(2*x)  == 2*sin(x)*cos(x); cos(2*x) ==
cos(x)*cos(x) - sin(x)*sin(x));

Dear Constantine,

I tried your files, but it seems to me that they do work, in fact.

Given the two files

--testkinemat1.input

)read expandsincos.input

Acon := matrix([[1, 0, Lo2*cos(phi)+Lo1*sin(phi), -sin(delta1)*a, 0, 0, 0],_
                [0, 1, Lo2*sin(phi)-Lo1*cos(phi),  a*cos(delta1), 0, 0, 0],_
                [0, 1, Lo2*sin(phi)+Lo1*cos(phi), 0,  a*cos(delta1), 0, 0],_
                [1, 0,-Lo2*cos(phi)+Lo1*sin(phi), 0, 0, -sin(delta2)*a, 0],_
                [0, 1,-Lo2*sin(phi)-Lo1*cos(phi), 0, 0,  a*cos(delta2), 0],_
                [1, 0,-Lo2*cos(phi)-Lo1*sin(phi), 0, 0, 0, -sin(delta2)*a],_
                [0, 1,-Lo2*sin(phi)+Lo1*cos(phi), 0, 0, 0, a*cos(delta2)]])

detAcon:=determinant(Acon)

--detAcon:=factor(detAcon)

detAcon:=expandsincos(detAcon)

detAcon:=simplify(detAcon)

-- expandsincos.input
-- Basic trigonometric expansion rules for axiom.
-- cos(2*x) == cos(x)**2 - sin(x)**2

expandsincos := rule (sin(x+y) == sin(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*cos(x); _
                      cos(x+y) == cos(x)*cos(y) - sin(x)*sin(y); _
                      sin(2*x) == 2*sin(x)*cos(x); _
                      cos(2*x) == cos(x)*cos(x) - sin(x)*sin(x)); 

typing

)read testkinemat1.input

does what is expected. Note that there must not be a semicolon after the
filename!
 
 > (1) I am trying to read expandsincos.input from within
 >     testkinemat1.input but this gives an error. Not clear why ??

I suspect that the error was something like

The file expandsincos.input; is needed but does not exist.

 > (3) I tried to write the script testkinemat1.input like a function
 >     without input or output variables (see below) but this gave
 >     errors. Not clear why ??

No! )read is a system command, not a "usual" operation. Sytem commands always
start with a ")". I believe that the want to be quite on their own, one per
line.

 >     functions, etc would be much appreciated. Especially the case

This just means that func1 is a function that returns a list. For example

(9) -> f:=(a,b,c)+->[a,b,c,a+b+c]

   Loading /home/martin/axiom/mnt/linux/algebra/ANON.o for domain 
      AnonymousFunction 
   (9)  (a,b,c) +-> [a,b,c,a + b + c]
                                                      Type: AnonymousFunction
(10) -> f(1,2,3)

   (10)  [1,2,3,6]
                                                   Type: List PositiveInteger


 > (5) In axiom what is the instruction to "pause" after the execution of

Sorry, I don't know. Quite possible that such a thing does not exist.

All the best,

Martin

PS: do you use the Windows or Linux version?

Dear Constantine,

 > I am using the linux version of axiom but cannot do any graphics.

OK, thats also what I use. I don't know the state of he art of graphics, in
fact. It seems that it works on linux, but I didn't try it out.

  
 > I have texmacs, but do not have the "interface" file to work with axiom. Is
 > it possible to run axiom from within texmacs and thus do graphics somehow ??

I don't have texmacs, I use emacs. As far as I know, graphics doesn't have
anything to do with texmacs. More information on using Axiom with TeXmacs:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/TeXmacs

As you are running linux, it might be that your installation is broken. The
page above says, that it should work "out of the box". Maybe you installed
TeXmacs before axiom?

I found that programming in the maxima language was a pain. However, maxima is
wonderful, if you like programming in lisp. In this case, you can program in
lisp and use all the available Maxima functions. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend
it as a programming tool.

 > If possible, please email me some example programs and how to run them with

I don't have any, sorry. You'll have to ask the maxima people.

Martin

Dear Colleagues,

Any assistance with the following would be appreciated:


 (1) I tried to plot something but no plot window appeared:
 
 (20) -> draw(cos(t),t=0..%pi);
    Compiling function %E with type DoubleFloat -> DoubleFloat 
    Graph data being transmitted to the viewport manager...
    AXIOM2D data being transmitted to the viewport manager...
 
                                                  Type:
 TwoDimensionalViewport

It was recommended to run sman but this is not an executable file on my
system. 
There is a file sman.H1, but this seems to be a C header file. Can
something be modified ??



(2)  I tried to write the script testkinemat1.input (pasted below) like a
function
    without input or output variables (see below) but this gave
    errors. Not clear what must be done ??


--testkinemat1.input 

--testkinemat1() ==_ 

Acon := matrix([[1, 0, Lo2*cos(phi)+Lo1*sin(phi), -sin(delta1)*a,0,0,0],_
[0, 1, Lo2*sin(phi)-Lo1*cos(phi), a*cos(delta1), 0, 0, 0],_

Can't help here since I don't have graphics yet. Tomorrow, maybe. I think
without sman it won't work...

It might be that a function definition in an input file needs line
continuations on every line. Furthermore, a function definition in an input
file (i.e., if it is interpreted, rather than compiled) looks like

fun() == (statement1; statement2; statement3)

statement3 is the result of the function. Hence:

 fun x == x; 1+1

will define a function (in fact, a so-called macro), that always returns x and
then evaluate the expression 1+1, giving 2. In this case, fun(x) will return x!
On the other hand,

 fun x == (x; 1+1)

will define a function that always returns 2.

Applying this to your situation:

testkinemat1() == (_
_
Acon := matrix([[1, 0, Lo2*cos(phi)+Lo1*sin(phi), -sin(delta1)*a,0,0,0],_
[0, 1, Lo2*sin(phi)-Lo1*cos(phi), a*cos(delta1), 0, 0, 0],_
[0,1, Lo2*sin(phi)+Lo1*cos(phi), 0, a*cos(delta1), 0, 0],_
[1, 0,-Lo2*cos(phi)+Lo1*sin(phi), 0, 0, -sin(delta2)*a, 0],_
[0, 1,-Lo2*sin(phi)-Lo1*cos(phi), 0, 0, a*cos(delta2), 0],_
[1, 0,-Lo2*cos(phi)-Lo1*sin(phi), 0, 0, 0, -sin(delta2)*a],_
[0, 1, -Lo2*sin(phi)+Lo1*cos(phi), 0, 0, 0, a*cos(delta2)]]);_
_
detAcon:=determinant(Acon);_
_
detAcon:=simplify(detAcon))

It also seems, that such a macro definition doesn't like comments inbetween...

Constantine,

If you are on a linux system then you need to set the AXIOM and PATH
shell variables. cd to the top level axiom directory and type:

export AXIOM=`pwd`/mnt/linux
export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
sman
draw(sin(x),x=-10..10)
draw(sin(x*y),x=-10..10,y=-10..10)

If you are using the windows version the graphics does not yet work there.

Tim

which is the way it works:

testkinemat1 returns the function

testkinemat1() returns the result of the function.

Only, if the function takes *exactly* one argument, you can leave away the
parentheses.

The semicolons do have a meaning:

(a;b;c) 

executes a, then b, then c and returns the result of executing c.

(a b;c) 

is nonsense.

In interpreted code, there mustn't be a line break *within* a
function. Therefore, a "line continuation character, namely "_" is provided, to
make it possible to have long function definitions. When the interpreter sees
"_", it "swallows" the following line break.

Hi!

I'm brand new to axiom, trying to solve my homework.

We shall redefine differentiation via rules. I have a simple idea to
solve this, and rules seem really simple, but I can't get a usefule
starting function defined.

My idea is to have a function abl(f,x) which simply does n*x^m ->
n*m*x^(m-1). So I defined:

apl(f,x) == coefficient(f,degree(f,x))*degree(f,x)*x^(degree(f,x)-1)

the same thing works great with maxima (but I can't get any rules
defined there). But axiom does some error messages when I try abl(x^5,x)
but then the correct result is displayed 5x^4

When I try abl(x,x) it does not work, abl(5,x) either...

any hints?

Bye...Frank

Dear Colleagues,

Any assistance with the following will be appreciated:

(1) In a user defined function what is the instruction to display something
like a symbolic
     variable, etc., and then to pause (and continue after hitting enter)
??

    eg in matlab: 
    a = 1 
    pause; 
    b = 3 
    pause;

(2) In axiom is there a built-in function to solve a set of nonlinear
equations analytically (or if                           necessary
numerically) wrt the user specified unknowns ??
      
    eg. in matlab
    solve('x1*x2 + a*x2^2 = 10', ' x1 - x2 = 2', 'x1', 'x2');


Regards,

C. Frangos.

The reason, that abl(x,x) does not work is displayed by axiom:

   There are 7 exposed and 5 unexposed library operations named 
      coefficient having 2 argument(s) but none was determined to be 
      applicable. Use HyperDoc Browse, or issue
                           )display op coefficient
      to learn more about the available operations. Perhaps 
      package-calling the operation or using coercions on the arguments
      will allow you to apply the operation.
 
   Cannot find a definition or applicable library operation named 
      coefficient with argument type(s) 
                                 Variable x
                               PositiveInteger
      
      Perhaps you should use "@" to indicate the required return type, 
      or "$" to specify which version of the function you need.

So, what does this mean? if you look at the output of 

)di op coefficient

axiom will respond with a (long) list of operations called
"coefficient". Usually, you are only interested in the "exposed" operations,
that is, those that are available "directly". (I could expand on this, but I
think for the moment it should be enough)

There are 11 exposed functions called coefficient :
   [1] (D,D2) -> D1 from D
            if D has AMR(D1,D2) and D2 has OAMON and D1 has RING
   [2] (CliffordAlgebra(D3,D1,D4),List PositiveInteger) -> D1
            from CliffordAlgebra(D3,D1,D4)
            if D1 has FIELD and D3: PI and D4: QFORM(D3,D1)
   [3] (D2,D) -> D1 from D
            if D has FAMONC(D2,D1) and D2 has SETCAT and D1 has CABMON
            
   [4] (D,D2) -> D1 from D
            if D has FMCAT(D1,D2) and D2 has SETCAT and D1 has RING
   [5] (D,NonNegativeInteger) -> D1 from D if D has MLO D1 and D1 has 
            RING
   [6] (D,List D4,List NonNegativeInteger) -> D from D
            if D has MTSCAT(D3,D4) and D3 has RING and D4 has ORDSET
         
   [7] (D,D1,NonNegativeInteger) -> D from D
            if D has MTSCAT(D3,D1) and D3 has RING and D1 has ORDSET
         
   [8] (D,NonNegativeInteger) -> D1 from D
            if D has OREPCAT D1 and D1 has RING
   [9] (D,List D5,List NonNegativeInteger) -> D from D
            if D has POLYCAT(D3,D4,D5) and D3 has RING and D4 has 
            OAMONS and D5 has ORDSET
   [10] (D,D1,NonNegativeInteger) -> D from D
            if D has POLYCAT(D3,D4,D1) and D3 has RING and D4 has 
            OAMONS and D1 has ORDSET
   [11] (TaylorSeries D3,NonNegativeInteger) -> Polynomial D3
            from TaylorSeries D3 if D3 has RING

Note that they are all different, they take different numbers of arguments, and
the types of those arguments are also different. For example, [11] takes a
(univariate) TaylorSeries over a Ring as first, and a NonNegativeInteger as
second argument.

Your rule gave axiom a "Variable x" as first and a PositiveInteger as second
argument. In the list above, there are seven operations with two arguments:
[1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[8],and [11], but none of them applies.

So, this is the low level reason. The "real", high level reason is: what would
you expect as answer from

coefficient(x*y,1) ?

Surely, you should make your question more precise, by specifying the variable:

coefficient(x*y,x,1).

So, I'd write:

abl(f,x) == coefficient(f,x,degree(f,x))*degree(f,x)*x^(degree(f,x)-1)

or, perhaps better

abl(f:POLY FRAC INT,x:Symbol):POLY FRAC INT ==
  coefficient(f,x,degree(f,x))*degree(f,x)*x^(degree(f,x)-1)

This makes sure that the first argument must be a polynomial, guarding against
input like abl(sin(x),x). On the other hand, the second variant won't work with
abl(2.0*x^2,x), whereas the first version does. The "correct" answer to this
problem is to define a package (which has to be put into a file and compiled):

)abbrev package ABL ableitung
ableitung(R:Ring): Exports == Implementation where
    Exports == with
      abl: (Polynomial R, Symbol) -> Polynomial R

    Implementation == add
      abl(f,x) == 
        d := degree(f,x)
        if zero? d 
        then 0
        else coefficient(f,x,d)
            *monomial(d::Polynomial R,x,(d-1)::NonNegativeInteger)

There are several things to notice:

* this definition works for any polynomial ring

* we had to check whether the degree of f is zero, because otherwise d-1 might
  be -1 and x^(-1) is not a polynomial anymore

* we have to tell the compiler explicitely that d-1 is nonnegative by
  (d-1)::NonNegativeInteger

* we had to use the operation "monomial" from the domain "Polynomial R" because
  the compiler is not smart enough to understand x^((d-1)::NonNegativeInteger)

* we have to write d::Polynomial R, because d is an integer, and the ring R
  could be anything. However, an integer can always be "coerced" into an
  element of a ring. Alternatively, we could write d*1. (In this case, the
  compiler would be smart enough to understand that 1 comes from the ring)

Thanks for the long answer! I'm using cvs version of axiom of savannah
if that matters. So I couldn't try out the package solution, yet...

should be FRAC POLY INT instead of POLY FRAC INT - at least it works
then...

Now, the second question regarding that problem...

We shall implement derivation rules via rules. First intention is:
ablrules := rule abl(a+b,c) == abl(a,c) + abl(b,c)

but axiom evaluates abl(a+b,c) to zero and makes a rule 0 ->
abl()+abl(). Simple ...rule 'abl(... does not work because of wrong
type...

Yes you can! put it into a file ("test.spad", for example) and say

)co test.spad

)sh ABL

should show you the operations you defined in the package ABL.

Does this mean, with POLY FRAC INT it does not work? What does not work, please
provide an example!

yes, and it should: a+b is constant in c...

I'll think about it.

Dear Frank,

 > We shall implement derivation rules via rules. First intention is:
 > ablrules := rule abl(a+b,c) == abl(a,c) + abl(b,c)
 > 
 > but axiom evaluates abl(a+b,c) to zero and makes a rule 0 ->
 > abl()+abl(). Simple ...rule 'abl(... does not work because of wrong
 > type... 

You'd have to read the section "Rules and Pattern Matching" in the axiom
book. The answer is:

abl := operator 'abl

ablplus := rule abl(a+b,c) == abl(a,c) + abl(b,c)

There is also a possibility of "adorning" pattern variables -- see the same
section. In your case, you want to have a rule that applies only to monomials,
so it will be roughly

ablmonomial := rule abl(m | monomial?(m)) == ...

However, it is pretty obvious that rules should only be the quick and dirty
approach...

Hope this helps,

Martin

ah, I see. I tried to make a file "ableitung.as" as seen in some example
and it won't find a useful compiler. Ok, that one works...

No problem at all with FRAC POLY INT.

I'm not that deep in math to understand why... :/

I'm running the CVS version from Savannah because the binary
distributions did not work for me. I have a few questions listed
below. Thanks to anyone who answers one of them.

1. Is there some way to make a function that is parametric like a
   package in a .input file?

2. The "delete" button does not work. Instead of deleting the
   character to the right of the current position, it inserts the text
   "^[[3~". How do I fix this?

3. When the compiler finds a compile-time error in my program, most of
   the time it reports this by basically dumping debug information
   about the internal state of the parser (like the program as a tree in
   Lisp syntax and the parser variables x, m and f). It does not seem
   to say which line the error is on. Is there some way to make the
   compiler output more user friendly error messages?

4. Most times when Axiom displays an error, it says
     protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
   at the end. What does this mean?

5. I once got an error message that said
 
     >> Error detected within library code:
     catdef: division by zero

   Is there some way to get a dump of the call-stack along with this?
   Otherwise it is a bit hard to know where things went wrong...

6. Why does this work fine

     g(x : Integer) : Integer ==
       d := [i for i in [1,5,3]]
       x*x+1

   when the following results in the
   error "NoValueMode is an unknown mode"?

     )abbrev package MYPACK MyPackage
     MyPackage : T == C where
      T== with
        g: Integer -> Integer
   
      C== add
        g(x : Integer) : Integer ==
          d := [i for i in [1,5,3]]
          x*x+1

7. Axiom will accept the input

)abbrev package MYPACK MyPackage
MyPackage : T == C where
 T== with
   myFun: Integer -> Integer
   myFun2: Integer -> Integer
   
 C== add
   myFun(x : Integer) : Integer == x*x + 1

just fine. If I try to call myFun2, it says

Internal Error
   The function myFun2 with signature hashcode is missing from domain 
      MyPackage 

How do I get Axiom to refuse to accept packages whose signature
does not match their implementation?

8. How do I get Axiom to quit bugging me about not having documented
   functions in .spad files?

9. How do I make the Axiom compiler less verbose? I only want error
   messages and warnings.

This is a problem with clef. I use emacs and shell mode, which is a lot more
comfortable than clef. An alternative is to use TeXmacs, but I won't use it, so
I can't help you there.

I don't think so -- at least not easily --, but it is possible to learn to
interpret them. I can offer help if you send me source and error message. As
many know, I propose to switch to the alternative compiler Aldor, which could
be used from within Axiom in past days. The syntax and semantics are very
similar, in fact, nearly identical, but I think that the compiler itself is
more mature.

This just means, that you hit an error. I don't know where it stems from. Tim
Daly might know.

You can say

)set message bottom on

or, more briefly,

)set me bo on

then Axiom (might) tell you which function is concerned. There is quite a bit
to know about debugging, I collected some bits and pieces on Mathaction:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/DebuggingAxiom

but clearly, there is a lot more to be found out.

Here we go: Axiom says

****** comp fails at level 4 with expression: ******
error in function g 

(SEQ (LET |d|
       (COLLECT (IN |i| | << | (|construct| 1 5 3) | >> |) |i|))
     (|exit| 1 (+ (* |x| |x|) 1)))
****** level 4  ******
$x:= (construct (One) 5 3)
$m:= $EmptyMode
$f:=
((((|x| # #) (* # # #) (** # # #) (+ # #) ...)))
 
   >> Apparent user error:
   NoValueMode
    is an unknown mode

Axiom says that it hasn't found a mode (= roughly type) for x, where 
x =  [1, 5, 3].

So, let's help Axiom a bit:

         g(x : Integer) : Integer ==
           d := [i for i in [1,5,3]$(List Integer)]
           x*x+1

should work. NOTE: The compiler is bugged, the interpreter is bugged and the
compiler-interpreter interaction is bugged. Hence: 

* don't trust the error messages too much, take them as hints. After a while
  you'll get a feeling what you really need to declare. (Since I think I've got
  this feeling already, I offer you help)

* you might like to consider the transcript of the axiom session where I fixed
  your package definition. After I changed the definition of g and recompiled,
  the compiler didn't complain anymore, but the results were, at the least
  surprising. Restarting Axiom made the problem go away. I added it at the
  bottom.

I don't know. Consider, however, that for categories, it is a necessary feature
to be able to declare operations which are not defined.

That's a feature! :-) Ask Tim.

The autoload messages (which make a lot of noise) can be switched off by saying

)set me autoload off

I didn't care for compiler noise, so I don't know about that one. You might
however like to open a second axiom session for compiling, and, after a
successful compile, say

)lib MYPACK

in the other.
 
Hope this helps. I'm very happy that another one tries to use the axiom
compiler! Maybe you'd even like to hack axiom to use the Aldor compiler again?
So far it is possible to use it for simple function definitions, but domains
compiled by Aldor cannot be used within Axiom anymore, sadly.
