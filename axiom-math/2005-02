I looked in all three sites for the February release, but 
it appears nowhere to my relatively unpracticed eye. Is 
this release really where advertized below?

=========================================
ECCAD, East Coast Computer Algebra Day, is an annual conference that
provides opportunities to learn and share new developments and to
present research results in the areas of symbolic and mathematical
computation. 

The 12th Annual East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD 2005) will be
held on Saturday, March 12, 2005. It will be hosted by the Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science at Ashland University in Ashland, Ohio,
USA. 

ECCAD 2005 will be in honor of Professor Bob Caviness's 65th birthday.
Bob Caviness is a Professor Emeritus (with a joint appointment in
Mathematical Sciences) and former Chair of the Department of Computer &
Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. His research
interests include the design and analysis of algebraic algorithms, in
particular, algorithmic decision procedures for integration in finite
terms and for computing closed form solutions of differential
equations.More recently he has turned to web-based technologies. He has
five Ph.D. and two M.S students. Professor Caviness has served in
various editorial capacities for the following jourmals: ACM
Transactions on Mathematical Software, ACM Computing Reviews,
CONSTRAINTS, the online e-commerce journal ACM SIGecom Exchanges, and
the Journal of Symbolic Computation. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the
latter journal for the period 1995-2000. He has also lectured widely and
served the profession in many other capacities. Happy Birthday, Bob! 

THEMES:
- - Algebraic Algorithms 
- - Symbolic-Numeric Computation 
- - Computer Algebra Systems 
- - Mathematical Communication 
- - Complexity of Algebraic Problems 
- - Symbolic and Numerical Linear Algebra 
- - Applications of Symbolic Computation

approved and if funding is available, you will receive your
reimbursement after the conference. All applications for support are due
by March 1, 2005. Support is subject to successful funding.

I've got some code I'm converting from Macaulay2 to Axiom that deals
with finite fields. I have a question regarding converting fields to
other representations

In maculay, I can set up a field with a particular quotient ring:

-- Set up a 13 bit polynomial ring over Z_2

i1 : A = ZZ/2[X]/(X^13+X^8+X^5+X^3+X^2+X+1)

o1 = A

o1 : QuotientRing

-- Make the Galois Field, a is the root

i2 : k = GF(A,Variable => a)

o2 = k

o2 : GaloisField

-- This uses a representation like Axiom's FiniteFieldCyclicGroup

i5 : a^5128

      5128
o5 = a

o5 : k

-- But I can look at the term like a polynomial also:

i6 : lift(a^5128, ambient k)

      11    10    9    5    4    2
o6 = X   + X   + X  + X  + X  + X

o6 : A

I can do everything except the last step in Axiom:

 GF2 := PF 2
 m := monomial(1,1)$SUP(GF2)
 f := m^13+m^8+m^5+m^3+m^2+m+1
 GF8192 := FFCGP(GF2,f)
 a := primitiveElement()$GF8192

So now:

(6) -> a**5128

          5128
   (6)  %A
Type: FiniteFieldCyclicGroupExtensionByPolynomial(PrimeField 2,?**13+?**8+?**5+?**3+?*?+?+1)

but I can't understand the output of )display op lift to figure out how
to get the result I want. I'm building the February (patch-30) release
on Ubuntu Warty as we speak, in the hope that Browse/Hypertex will make
it easier to understand the available documentation.

I do know I could use the FFPX constructor to get the large field in
polynomial form, and then call discreteLogarithm to get the exponents. I
guess my question is can I do the converse easily?

Dear Humberto,

I'm not quite sure whether this is what you were looking for or not, but maybe
it helps:

reduce(+,[coordinates(a^5128).i *q^(i-1) for i in 1..#coordinates (a^5128)])

I hope HyperDoc works for you!

Martin

No, it has the wrong type. But I think I can do it looping over the
coordinates as you do. Actually, what I wanted *was* the coordinates, I
just didn't know I could get them :-).

It does, linux/x86.
