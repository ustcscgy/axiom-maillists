I am sorry Ed, it is not my intention to defend GPL but to me your

I meant that the reason why some people think GPL as a good strategy
and why other people disagree depends on their subjective views about
how best to promote open source software development. In many cases
this does not depend directly on what the license actually says but
rather how people react to what it says. Some people do not like to be
forced to do something based on a matter of principle alone and would
not compromise on this even if there might in some cases be some
positive effects when viewed in the large.

GPL definitely states that if you use GPL code in some software
package then you do *not* retain any legal right to prevent disclosure
of the source code of other parts of the whole package. It is written
this way precisely because the Free Software Foundation (FSF) wants to
discourage the view of software as "intellectual property" in the
usual sense. They want all software to be freely available to all. You
can say that in your opinion this is stupid or irritating, but I do
not think you can argue that it violates your rights. After all you
are perfectly free not to use any GPL code in your package if you do
not accept these conditions.

I do not think that GPL is "insane" even if I do not agree with it.

What you describe does not apply to GPL. GPL specifically says that
the full source of the software must be available to *all* - even
corporations. The only requirement is that anyone who uses GPL
software must license the entire result as GPL. Of course this often
makes it unattractive to corporate users who view their own software
as "closed source" property - but some corporations do not see things
this way and they still manage to make a profit.

> The non-commercial virus in Aldor is another case.

I think this is a different case from GPL. The APL2 non-commercial use
clause specifically restricts the use of Aldor in certain "commercial"
circumstances but GPL does not. GPL only adds additional requirements
that might be unattractive to some people under these same
circumstances - it does not directly prevent it's use.

What makes APL2 "viral" is different. It is because the most likely
use of Aldor in Axiom is as a replacement for the Spad library
compiler and Axiom can not exist without such a library compiler. Once
you start down the road of writing essential Aldor-based library code
or re-writing Spad code in Aldor, you make it so that Aldor
effectively becomes a requirement for building Axiom. So then Axiom is
forced to adopt the APL2 non-commercial use clause in order to allow
Axiom to be distributable as a single complete system including the
now essential component Aldor.

I agree. And I guess that is what the FSF is deliberately trying to
pro-actively promote. But philosophically this does make GPL
deliberately less-free is this sense. Except for software that is
specifically licensed as "public domain", I think the modified BSD
license is probably the "most-free" of any commonly used open source
license - it is sufficiently free to allow it's use in non-free
software without any "viral" side-effects. In the best of all possible
worlds this is probably the license that most people would prefer for
open source software. But the FSF seems to think that it is necessary
to compromise on this freedom in order to actively promote the early
dissemination of the open source concept to the widest possible range
of software developers rather than waiting and hoping for them to
eventually realize the benefits of open source development in the
longer term themselves.

Again, I think whether you view this as a good or bad thing is a
subjective issue unless or until there can be some proof (maybe some
kind of statistics about software development or something like that)
that shows objectively whether GPL or BSD is the more effective
strategy for promoting open source. For sure I do not know.

Bill Page.

Hi,

Bill Page <bill.page@newsynthesis.org> (2007-09-04 20:23:20) :

This is not correct. Please read it. In short words, GPL requires
availability of source code to *users* of the software. Saying it
requires *public* disclosure is old FUD.

(By the way, licenses that discriminate between users are commonly
considered neither free -- as in freedom -- nor open source licenses.)

This is not correct either. This is only for *binaries* that you
*distribute*, because the right to redistribute the (GPL parts of the)
software is given to you *by* the GPL. But if you do not redistribute
and only *use* the software, you are not bound by anything. You do not
even have to accept the GPL license (it is only needed if you want the
right to redistribute).

APL2 is neither free (as in freedom) nor open source software. I do
not understand what makes you so enthusiastic about it. Nothing new
under the sun.

I don't understand the distinction you are making. To me you have just

Of course. That is trivially true. I am talking about "use" in the
sense of incorporating some GPL software into a new package which I
assume that one intends to distribute - otherwise these comments are
just empty. The end user is free to use this software for their own
use. GPL does not place any restriction on whether or not that use
includes using the software for commercial purposes. APL2 does include
such a restriction.

I do not know what definition of "open source" you are using but I
certainly agree that it is not free (as in freedom). But neither is
GPL. You are not free to use GPL software anyway you like. It is
specifically limited so that you may only use GPL software in a manner
which is considered to be beneficial to making more software open in
the same way via the copyleft provisions. As far as I can see, the
lack of freedom in APL2 is similar in magnitude but quite different in
intent.

I am enthusiastic about the fact that Aldor source code is now easily
available under a license that will allow me (and presumably other
interested people) to make improvements to it and to use it in my work
without the fear that someday my investment in this work may no longer
be available to me. Prior to APL2 this was only possible by making a
special request to aldor.org and the future was much less certain. Now
all I have to do is go to the aldor.org website and download it from
the svn repository. The rest of this license stuff is mostly
irrelevant until or unless it actually gets in the way of some thing
that I or some other new Aldor  or Axiom developer really wants to do
with it. At this time I am certainly not interested in any possible
commercial uses Aldor. Perhaps other people are...

Bill Page.

Maybe I misunderstood what you wrote. The distinction I am making is
that the GPL does not require you to make a *public* disclosure of the
changes you made to the GPLed program. I can think of scenarii where a
company (or other) makes changes to a GPLed software. It does not have
to publish the changes *on the web* but can keep them private. And if
it distributes the software to its clients, in compliance with the
GPL, it has only to give the source to its clients (and not to the
public). (Of course clients have the right to disclose the software on
the web, if they want, but it might not always be their best
interest).

Saying GPL requires public disclosure is a common misconception about
the GPL and often used as FUD against the use of the license. Maybe
you were not meaning this at all. Sorry then.

Well, I suppose I shall read "use" as you said above. Otherwise, you
can use (not distribute) a GPL software the way you want. The major
restriction of the of GPL is that you cannot *distribute* a GPLed
software in a proprietary way. Or, in other words, you cannot
distribute the software with less freedoms than the ones you were
given by the GPL (hence its incompatibility with licences more
restrictive than the GPL). Or, in short, you cannot 'take away'
freedoms from GPL software.

I disagree. APL2 puts more restrictions on use (not only distribution)
and discriminates between users.

It prevents integration of Aldor in free software distributions as
Debian or Fedora. (The kind of things I am interested in.)

Anyway, Aldor is by no standard open source or free software. I have
personally been trapped in the past in such non-free licences. I will
never consider again non-free sofware for scientific work. But it is
my personal choice and I can understand you make others.

It makes me simply stronger in my mind that we (the Axiom community)
had nothing good to expect from Aldor and from *waiting* for its
release as (real) open source software (that has not yet occured).

Best regards,
Frédéric Lehobey

Could you give an example of how you think you might be "trapped" by
using Aldor under APL2?

Who was waiting? The various incarnations of Axiom have all made
improvements to Spad (to a greater or lesser degree).

Still Aldor is still by far very much superior to Spad and in my
opinion is very likely to remain so provided that it can attrack an
active developer community.

They are not really part of Debian but provided as a courtesy to
Debian users: http://www.debian.org/social_contract (#5)

And I can tell you that technically it makes a real
difference. Packages in non-free do not take advantage of all the
benefits of the Debian infrastructure (autobuilders, etc.).

The scenario I gave in my previous message is not possible. I cannot
either distribute Aldor alongside many other free software libraries
(can you link Aldor with free libraries?). I agree you can
rethorically view this as a symmetric problem with the free libraries
that have incompatible license with APL2. But I do not want to run
into that game: Aldor is the bad non-free player.

Dear Tim,

I just realised that you are possibly breaking Copyright in your pamphlet.  See

Ok. I'll withdraw the change and see if I can understand what it takes to
be in compliance. I read the license over once and I'm not sure what it
means. It will take several readings to guess. Thanks for the heads-up.

In any case, I think it would be a lot better to describe what the algorithm
does instead of writing a treatise on Pfaffians.  I'd presume that most peo=
ple
have access to the internet, so a link to the wikipedia entry on Pfaffians =
and
a link to G=C3=BCnter Rote's paper, including the section numbers (i.e., 3.=
2 and
3.3), and corrections thereof (the leading coefficient of \lambda^2 in equa=
tion
(22) should be 1 rather than -1) would be more apropriate and more helpful.

Finally, if I read

\author{Timothy Daly, Gunter Rote, Martin Rubey}

(it's G=C3=BCnter, by the way) I'd think that the three of them implemented=
 the
algorithm, but that's maybe only my personal view.  And I must say that I w=
as a
bit surprised that you claim copyright for pasting text from wikipedia, but=
 did
not state the fact that most (all?) of the material is from that site.

That's why I use Wikipedia for just a starting point - often their
references are useful, and I try to write my own pamphlet based on the
original source material.

GFDL is a bit of a mess, IMHO - I've never cared for it, and literate
programming is going to confuse the issue even more.  The Debian
distribution doesn't put stuff with unmodifiable sections in Debian main:

Please send a reference to Gunter's paper.
Please post a plain-text latex for the way you expect Gunter's
name to be spelled. All of my mail readers render it with a 'u'.
Please document your algorithm.

In total number of characters and time, the source text TeX, the
regression test case generation, the system merge issues, the testing
and the patch generation exceed the number of characters posted in the
algorithm. And the wikipedia text, despite appearances, is not "cut
and paste" but is hand written in latex format. In total I spent quite
a few hours on making the pamphlet.  If you had posted the final
pamphlet documentation with regression tests as a diff-Naur patch
I would have had nothing to contribute.

According to my first reading the wikipedia license appears to specify
the page layout of the final document which WAY exceeds the bounds of
common sense. I plan to change the content using other sources.

The fact that you understand the pfaffian enough to write a program does
not mean that the next person who has to maintain/extend/rewrite the
pfaffian has the same understanding. The point of the game is to make
the code live beyond the original author. Otherwise, what is science for?

Characters maybe, time I doubt.  It took me quite a while to figure out that
there is a misprint in the article.

So what?  If you retype a copyrighted book, you are still breaking copyright.

I'm sorry about that.

Yes, that's what I think, too.  Although I hurry to say that I do *not*
understand the Pfaffian enough.

Maybe for you.  I just needed a Pfaffian to do some experiments, and couldn't
find an implementation.  So I looked for an algorithm I thought I was able to
implement.  If you can use it, fine, if you can't, leave it.

It is an excellent piece of work and I thank you for doing it.

I hope to merge it into the SQMATRIX domain, since it requires
the matrices to be square. It looks like I can use the antisymmetric
function to replace some of your code. But I'll have to do more
reading to gain a better understanding of the algorithm.

Thanks,
Tim

I do not know of such a function.  However, you can use antiSymmetric? to check
whether the matrix is antisymmetric, which is required.

I guess you should follow the implementation of determinant.  Just grep for

"determinant.*=="

to get the picture.

By the way, SQMATRIX not being a domain of MatrixCategory is a sad limitation
of SPAD (not present in Aldor, fortunately).

If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask.

Martin,

I've been studying Pfaffian systems (related to robotics, a field I
know a bit about). It seems that your algorithm does not work for
embedded matrices as in:

z:SQMATRIX(2,INT):=[[0,0],[0,0]]
m:SQMATRIX(2,INT):=[[0,1],[-1,0]]
m2:SQMATRIX(4,SQMATRIX(2,INT)):=[[m,z,z,z],[z,m,z,z],[z,z,m,z],[z,z,z,m]]
which should be 1*1*1*1 = 1

Am I doing something wrong?

Tim

Ah, Gaby, while I've got your attention....

It appears that installing OpenAxiom interferes with an already
installed Axiom. Alfredo looked into the problem and it appears 
to be a collision using the AXIOM shell variable.

Could you please rename the shell variable to use to be something
other that "AXIOM", say "OPENAXIOM"?

Many thanks,
Tim

OpenAxiom installs its binaries in a directory distinct from
any other Axiom flavors.  It sets its internal variable AXIOM *within*
its own script and does not depend on external setting of it. 
The fact that Axiom seems to need external setting of the AXIOM
environment variable sounds to be like a bug that should be fixed in Axiom.
