Greetings!  I've been mulling this over and think I have the beginning
of an idea which I hope will make everyone happy.

Here are my preliminary thoughts:

1) In an ideal world, GCL can do for lisp what gcc has done for C.  I
   see a strong parallel here, and would like to strengthen the
   connections between the projects to the benefit of lisp developers
   and free software users alike.

   As pointed out before, C development in the free software world
   looks like this: a GPL'ed compiler and linker, an LGPL'ed libc
   'runtime', and user object code/executables licensed as they wish,
   as long as they just reference the LGPL'ed libraries.  I think that
   everyone is happy with this situation.  I know I am; and I believe
   it has served the cause of free software development in C
   outstandingly well.

   The problem when extending this to lisp is that, in typical usage,
   each executable has the compiler, the linker/dumper, the 'runtime'
   and the users code all dumped into one image.  This is of course
   not the only way in which binaries can be produced and distributed,
   but is very convenient.  One could also distribute one or more .o
   files, and have the user load them themselves.

   So say we followed the C model, and GPL'ed the 'compiler', which
   includes the linker and dumper, LGPL'ed the 'runtime', which are
   all the other functions specified in the common lisp spec, and
   maintained that user produced .o file have the license of the
   user's choosing.  As GCL produces these via .c, .h, and .data
   files, and in some cases writes some of itself into the .c files,
   (specifically cmpinclude.h), we might apply the 'bison exception'
   in this case if needed.  What would this mean for GCL users?  Here
   is how I think it would work:

     1) Someone ships a 'traditional' image produced by save-system
        with all of GCL and their code in it together.  This
        distributed 'combination' image would be GPL, and the user
        must supply the source.  The user supplied non-GCL source
        could be more permissively licensed under BSD as in the case
        of axiom, as BSD is compatible with GPL.

     2) Someone ships a 'new' image produced by an (as yet to be
        written) save-system variant which would leave out the
        compiler, linker, and dumper from the image.  This
        'combination' image would be treated the same as someone
        statically linking in libc.  I'm not sure of the details, but
        the gist would be that user source which did not directly
        affect the 'runtime' GCL code would not have to be supplied. 

     3) Someone ships binary only .o files according to the license of
        their choosing, as long as they reference only the LGPL'ed
        'runtime' functions and not the compiler, linker, or dumper.
        This is closest to the model of proprietary binaries shipped
        for GNU/Linux systems today.  Here the user's running GCL is
        analogous to the OS, their execution of the 'load' command to
        load the .o files analogous to the action of ld.so in
        GNU/Linux, and the .o files' invocation of the common lisp
        runtime functions analogous to proprietary binaries' calling
        libc functions.  

     4) Someone ships the program in source form according to the
        license of their choosing for the user's GCL to compile.
        Can't see a problem here.


    It is my preliminary opinion that this would inconvenience no one,
    make everyone happy, and be arguably fairer all around than the
    current setup.  In particular, it would free GCL to build upon the
    excellent GPL'ed compiler/linker infrastructure from the C world,
    which I think is critical for GCL's long term future.  As I've
    stated before, I'd like to eventually have GCL act as a gcc
    frontend in addition to its current mode of operation.  These
    license issues would doubtlessly only get worse as such a project
    would unfold.

2)  I think that unexec is a nice feature in GCL, as is the bfd
    linking, and I don't want to have to get into the business of
    emasculating the program for licensing reasons, especially as I
    have yet to hear from anyone who needs/wants a closed source GCL
    binary.  I don't even relish the idea of trying to reconstruct
    what happened more than 10 years ago with unexec and Dr. Schelter,
    though my opinion is that it is very likely he got some permission
    to uses these files in GCL.  But these files are being continually
    developed under the GPL, making 'grandfathering' exceptions a bit
    messy from unexec developers' points of view.  I hope the setup
    outlined above would enable us to focus on quality, and leave these
    matters behind us once and for all.

3)  I would like to hear from as many GCL users as possible regarding
    their opinions on how this would affect their work.  My
    understanding is that it would not affect GCL's current main
    users -- maxima, acl2, and axiom, at all.

Take care,

This puts it quite clearly.  The GPL is not about defending our work
(against proprietary forks etc.), it is about constraining others to
license *their* work under the FSF's preferred terms whenever possible.

The LGPL defends our work very nicely without constraining others'
work.  That is good enough for me.  I do not claim to have such a
superior ethical and moral compass as to decide for others what an
appropriate license for *their* work is.

    I have no trouble agreeing with Richard (and the FSF) about
    the undesirable nature of closed source software

This seems to be a misunderstanding, because my views are not about
"open source" or "closed source" software.  Those terms were
formulated by people who disagree with me, and are closely linked with
views that disagree with mine.

What we say in the free software movement is that non-free software is
antisocial.

    Philosophically it
    does not make sense to me to use legal means (software licenses)
    to "enforce" freedom.

The GNU GPL uses legal means to protect users freedom from middlemen
who might wish to pass along the software without the freedom.  We've
been doing this for many years and it works well.

    I agree with the FSF that the use of copyright law is *not*
    appropriate for software.

That is not what we say.  We say that software should be free.
Abolishing copyright would not have this effect.  Rather, its
effect would be that contracts would be used to make programs
non-free.

    This puts it quite clearly.  The GPL is not about defending our work
    (against proprietary forks etc.), it is about constraining others to
    license *their* work under the FSF's preferred terms whenever possible.

The GPL is about protecting our work from misappropriation, and
leveraging our work so that others who wish to incorporate it in their
published programs must make those programs free as well.  (See
http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/pragmatic.html.)

However, it is inaccurate to say that the GPL requires someone to use
"the FSF's preferred terms" for his code; the GPL does not do that.
Your changes do not have to be licensed under the GPL specifically.
They can be released under any GPL-compatible free software license.

I have no trouble agreeing with Richard (and the FSF) about
the undesirable nature of closed source software and I also
agree about it being an ethical issue. But I disagree
completely with the proposed solution. Philosophically it
does not make sense to me to use legal means (software licenses)
to "enforce" freedom. This is inherently self-contradictory
and risks weakening the original argument in favour of freedom
in the first place. In my mind it is similar to "fighting for
peace" - a concept that as far as I am concerned has been
amply disproved by our generation. (Please pardon me if this
seems like an inappropriate allusion to some of you.)

But I think we can, with no contradiction use legal means to
*enable* freedom. Then we can use education and example to
encourage people (and commercial software developers) to choose
freedom. I think that the GNU foundation, through tools like
gcc and linux have already demonstrated (to many people's
surprise) that this strategy actually works very well.

We can (and do) also use legal means to protect the rights
of authors (developers, designers, etc.) in return for free
access to their creations. The intent of the law is to
encourage free innovation and accessibility by making the
work public.

I agree with the FSF that the use of copyright law is *not*
appropriate for software. Writing a program is not like
writing a book. Authors (usually) do not want their work
plagiarized. (Most) artists want access to their work
controlled and do not wish it to be copied and used as the
basis of the art of other people. And certainly not without
due credit.

Developing software on the other hand is rather more like
"invention" or industrial design. Inventors do want their
work to be used by others (but of course usually wish to be
paid for their efforts). And the government and the public
do want to encourage this kind of innovation which has so
clearly contributed to our collective quality of life over
the last few centuries. However I am not really convinced
of the appropriateness of software patents either.

Pure mathematicians, theoretical physicists and many other
scientists (usually) do not try to patent or copyright their
theorems and results. But they want to publish their results,
sometimes simply for their own sake, and sometimes to
establish their credentials among their peers (and thereby
help to ensure their personal job security, etc.). But they
do want "credit" and recognition for there work, both
academically and socially. There are well established social,
cultural and even economic conventions which make this
possible.

I think it is one of the great social innovations of the
Web is that it makes attribution of authorship and allocation
of "credit" so straight forward and equitable. We simply
"link" to other people's web pages. In a sense it is easier
to reference someone else's work than it is to copy it and
mis-represent it as your own. And of course this has become
part of the Web culture. I think this is one of the reasons
that the Web grew (and continues to grow) at such an
unprecedented pace.

I think the motivations of those who develop free software
is most similar to the motivations of the scientists. And
I think they need a similar kind of social and cultural
protection and encouragement for their efforts. Luckily,
it seems to me, the Web is just the kind of tool that makes
this possible.

Of course there will be people who use software for
unethical purposes just as their are those scientists who
use science in this manner. But public awareness and
established cultural norms should help to limit this
harmful activity. But I still do not wish scientific
ethics to be enforced by law because I think science
requires exactly the same kind of freedoms that the FSF
argues is required for (ethical) software development.

So the bottom line: For axiom and for GCL I am very much
in favour of the status quo. I think going to GPL would
be a mistake (though probably not a disastrous mistake).
Camm's recent proposal that GCL follow the gcc model
makes the most sense to me. I think the modifications
required to GCL to make conformance to the gcc developer
model possible (i.e. make it possible to use GCL to
develop applications which do not by default inherit the
full functionality of GCL in the resulting product)
would not be difficult. So GCL can be more like BSD in
that respect, i.e. it should be legally possible to
use GCL to develop software that is not free provide
of course that it no longer embodies GCL itself.

On the other hand, I am a little worried about Axiom's BSD
license - especially since Axiom (as it exists now) makes it
possible to "escape" to the underlying GCL lisp environment
and this environment is (apparently) an integral part of the
usual means for the extension of Axiom through the compilation
of the algebra code library. Does the design of Axiom also
need to change to be compatible with Camm's proposal for
GCL i.e. can Axiom be used successfully with the version
of GCL that does not allow the GCL functionality itself to
be cloned? Will the GCL functionality that is embedded in
Axiom be sufficiently well separated and/or separable from
the Axiom code itself that separate and somewhat incompatible
licensing terms coexist for the two parts?

Apparently the terms (BSD) under which Axiom was released
specifically include the possibility that closed source
extensions of Axiom might be developed for commercial or
other purposes. If Axiom must be viewed as an extension
of the full underlying lisp environment, then such closed
source development would presumably only be possible for
the version of Axiom based on a lisp with a compatible
licensing scheme (e.g. CCL, but maybe not GCL).

Perhaps the best approach would be to do nothing at all
and to allow the social and cultural mechanisms that I
mentioned above develop along the lines that already
seem rather well established and in the "right direction".
I think it is reasonable to expect that the availability
of an advanced and well supported open source computer
algebra systems like Axiom (and of course like MAXIMA
and YACAS and a few others) will establish new examples
that will encourage the traditionally closed source
computer algebra developers to become more "open-minded"
themselves. In fact I think there is some evidence that
this is already happening.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I totally agree with you on the ethical or moral point of view. I do not
claim that the "all software should be free" claim is ethically
superior.

However, as a GNU GPL proponent, I do not like at all that some people
could do some proprietary software (i.e. their work) using *my* free
software work. If they don't want to play the free software game, ok,
that's their right. But then, they should redo (or buy or wathever) all
the hard work that has been invested in free software.

That's said and regarding Axiom current BSD licensing, I agree with
Bill's status quo proposal. The most urgent now is to have a strong and
working Axiom system, with its community. Time will tell if the BSD
licensing is an error. At that time, we will take the appropriate
measures.

Best regards,
david

That is precisely the difference between your position and mine.  Though
I would *prefer* that others contribute free software, I am happy to
have them write proprietary software on top of my free software.  In
fact, that is part of its freedom.  Similarly, I expect to be able to
use proprietary modules in my free software.  I would consider it
grossly unethical (and probably illegally anti-competitive) for a vendor
of proprietary software to forbid me to link my free software to their
proprietary software.

All that being said, I am not really interested in pursuing this
discussion further.  I think everyone has laid out his or her position
clearly.

If anyone wants to hear my counter-quibble about the meaning of
"preferred terms", let me know (I sort of doubt it).
