Ooops. Wrong list. This discussion should go to axiom-legal
which was created for the express purpose of keeping legal
issues out of the developer list. Please use that list instead.

I had an email discussion with Richard Stallman about the issue of
using GPL and BSD licensed programs together in a non-commmercial
setting. His statement is that the two licenses are compatible and he
sees no license problems that arise in either direction.

That said, I beg of you not to continue a legal discussion in
the developer list.

Nothing. 

The Modified BSD allows anyone to do this.

Compatible just means what is written here:

http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatIsCompatible

What does it mean to say that two licenses are "compatible"?
------------------------------------------------------------
     In order to combine two programs (or substantial parts of them) 
into a larger work, you need to have permission to use both programs in 
this way. If the two programs' licenses permit this, they are 
compatible. If there is no way to satisfy both licenses at once, they 
are incompatible.

     For some licenses, the way in which the combination is made may 
affect whether they are compatible--for instance, they may allow linking 
two modules together, but not allow merging their code into one module.



So this says something about whether the code can be combined.

As you can see, there is another paragraph right after it.


What does it mean to say a license is "compatible with the GPL".
----------------------------------------------------------------
     It means that the other license and the GNU GPL are compatible; you 
can combine code released under the other license with code released 
under the GNU GPL in one larger program.

     The GPL permits such a combination provided it is released under 
the GNU GPL. The other license is compatible with the GPL if it permits 
this too.



As I read the last paragraph, it is exactly as Gernot wanted to say. The 
resulting program must be released under GPL. I cannot read that the GPL 
allows to distribute the combined work under modified BSD.

Just curious: What _exactly_ would forbid to distribute Axiom under GPL?

I think I remember that you said that you had a special agreement with 
NAG about that, ie you cannot change the license.

I guess sooner or later we will have GPL'ed code inside Axiom. So what 
you are saying is that we should not bother too much with GPL'ed code 
but rather use it and thus change the Axiom License to GPL.

Would be interesting to hear what other people think about Axiom under GPL.

On the other hand the side-effect would likely be a fork in the axiom
project. I've seen discussions for and against going GPL. I argued for
GPL before axiom was released but accepted the MBSD as a reasonable license.

Consider that the real point of licensing is that you can sue people
who violate the license and that the point of bringing suit is to
get money (ask any lawyer... I have) you'll see that axiom's license
is uninteresting. Any lawyer worth his $250/hour will tell you that
you don't sue people "on principle". Such suits are considered "harassing"
and are generally thrown out. Threatening to bring such suits without
actually following up is called barristry and is grounds for being sued.

After 6 years, endless debate, several books, and a few conversations
with actual lawyers I'm completely disgusted with the whole debate.
It is unproductive in the extreme. That's why axiom-legal exists.

Oh, and another point of fact... In order to bring a suit you have to 
have "standing" and you have to show actual damages. Thus you can't
just march off to court without showing that your suit has "merit"
and that you believe you can win. Doing so will get you a court fine
and open you to counter-suit. This is why you can't sue Microsoft.

A suit against an open software project for mixing GPL and MBSD code
is unlikely to cause "actual damages" and since you are not directly
impacted financially you're unlikely to have "standing". Further since
the MBSD requires you to hold NAG free from responsibility you can't
sue them. And since no-one owns axiom (I certainly don't) there isn't
an organization to sue and there can be no monetary gain. No lawyer
is going to take the case and no judge is going to hear the case.

Since the MBSD and the GPL are "spiritual sisters", differing in details
only a lawyer knows, it is unlikely to be a point of legal debate. Both
fulfill the spirit of the GPL.

It will, however, be a point of religious debate. Software people
think they can read a license and understand what it means, what
it implies, and how it will be interpreted by the courts. That's
like giving a C++  program to a lawyer, asking them to read it,
understand it, and state how it will be interpreted on an
unspecified machine running some unknown operating system.

Law terms do NOT mean what laymen think they mean. I can tell you from
experience because I consulted a lawyer about my employment contract
and got a great lesson in humility. It's not about intelligence, it's
about education in the field.

Without legal advice debating the issue of single or dual licensing of
axiom under the GPL vs MBSD is an argument about the number of angels
that can dance on the head of a pin. All religion and no facts.  Facts
cite case law. I'm clearly not capable of citing case law with authority.

So my view is that either we hire a lawyer (don't look to me for a
donation) or we simply agree not to debate things we don't understand.

"So my view is that either we hire a lawyer (don't look to me for a
donation) or we simply agree not to debate things we don't understand."

Second the motion.  No decision we can arrive at will mean anything if
someone tries to make an issue of it.

GCL's approach seems sensible to me - use the GPL bits, but make it
optional - e.g. it is possible to build and use GCL without only LGPL
code.  Axiom is buildable and usable now without GPL code, so retain
that functioning core and use GPL code to add additional functionality
(eg GSL).

In the world today, it seems that risk of legal action is like risk of
getting hit by a car - you can drive sensibly and minimize that risk by
not speeding, obeying traffic signs, (e.g. don't pirate software and
knowingly steal code) but you can't plan ahead by knowing every
direction a car might come at you along the whole of your trip.  You
can do everything right and still get hit, so beyond a certain point
you have to conclude you've done your best and start driving.

Cheers,
CY

I think Tim's comments about licensing are "right on".

So in this light, how should we view the current situation with
Aldor? Last March I proposed that we (or I) simply go ahead and
license Aldor source as GPL (or under the Aldor Public License).
The benefits for Axiom are obvious and I can see not negative
affects on Aldor and the people who current depend on it via
aldor.org. At the time Mike Dewar convinced me to "wait until"
summer with the promise that it would be discussed when he met
Steven Watt at one of several meetings. He also said that NAG
"would likely approve any reasonable proposal". Again in August
we heard that it had been discussed. But there has been no news
of any kind sense then.

Do you think I should resurrect my plan to just unilaterally
release Aldor as open source and see what happens?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Please don't be stupid.  You can't release Aldor as open source because
you don't have any right to do so.  Any illegal distribution of Aldor
sources will, however, almost certainly scupper any chance of of it
ever being released under an open-source licence.

I understand your frustration at the slow progress on this, but that
doesn't give you the right to take something that isn't rightfully
yours.  The current situation is that NAG has agreed in principle to a
proposal from Stephen Watt to release Aldor under a new licence.  We are
now waiting for him to provide details of what that licence should be.

Mike.

I realize that I have no "right" to do so. The point was that
(perhaps) doing so would not have an negative consequences -
at least not more negative than the current situation. Plus it
continues to make the point that many people consider it critical
to the future of both projects.

Could you explain why you say that? What consequences do you see
for an unauthorized distribution? Why would it stop Aldor from
being properly licensed as open source? Once it is open source
there is a possibility of many different distributions (provided
of course that they compile with the licensing).

Is "slow progress" the same thing as "no progress"? ;)

As I see it I would not be "taking" anything. If the desire was
clearly stated that the current owners did not want and did not
intend to make Aldor open source, then the situation would be
different. Anyway there are good reasons for me not to proceed
with what I suggested besides the legal ones. Clearly it would be
much better for everyone if aldor.org would simply proceed with
an open source license.

Really, how difficult is that for someone who really cares about
the future of Aldor and Axiom to release Aldor as open source?
I can not help but think that the delays are either deliberate or
indicate a lack of interest on the part of the current owners.
But I guess I am just being stupid...

Isn't that exactly the situation that you described in March last
year?

To release it you would need to select a licence.  How do you know it is
the licence that the owners of the code would choose?  

Its clear that some people (including, despite what you imply in the
rest of your message, myself) are keen to see Aldor open-sourced, but
you need to keep a sense of perspective.  Nobody has any right to demand
an open-source Aldor, and the kind of tactics that you seem to be
advocating are just going to alienate the very people who you need on
your side.

You are asking NAG and the other owners of Aldor to do you a favour,
which will take time and effort.  Do you really expect us to release
Aldor as open source if you try and force our hand with illegal actions?

No.  There has been progress as I explained.

Why do you say that?  If we weren't interested in an open-source Aldor
then we'd just say so.  Then I wouldn't have to respond to emails on the
subject every few months :-)

No.  The proposal from Stephen was received at the beginning of this
month.

Kind regards,

Mike.

Mike, is it realistic to think that the public sees an open Aldor before 
Christmas 2006?

I'm a bit confused.  The Aldor distribution currently available is
already under the Aldor Public License.  My original understanding was
that there are certain core bits of Aldor (the compiler?) that are
binary only in the current publicly available distribution.  The binary
only bits are clearly NOT released in source code to the general public
under ANY license at this time.  Did I misunderstand the situation?

Nevertheless, they are still the only ones who can make that decision.

Which is why the discussions of improving SPAD have gained momentum
recently.  If we don't want to wait on Aldor, improving SPAD or
starting anew are the only viable options.  Taking unapproved action
with Aldor would be an unmitigated disaster legally and public
relations wise, to say nothing of how it would be viewed by the
copyright holders (who have already been very generous.)

NO.  The distinction between fairly subtle questions of license
compatibilities and releasing code without the concent of the copyright
holders is night and day.  In the former case the questions are
reasonable - is this OK or not under these conditions?  It is generally
accepted that the Modified BSD license permits code to be used in GPL
programs, and this has been done many times in practice without issue. 
Releasing code without approval from the copyright holder under ANY
license is another matter altogether, and is not reasonable under any
interpretation I have ever heard of - NAG and Aldor.org own the code.
The response would be negative in the extreme - people may decide to
give away code, but it is THEIR decision to do so. 

Also, when people don't use Modified BSD or GPL there is generally a
reason they choose not to, so incompatibilities must be respected.  The
proper thing to do in such a case is contact the authors/copyright
holders and discuss the issues.  Tim is correct that only lawyers can
render really useful opinions on these issues, but that doesn't mean we
don't need to make a good faith effort to respect the license to the
best of our abilities.  Aldor I think is very clearly NOT GPL or
Modified BSD, and unless and until they decide to change that we are
obligated to respect that decision.

No, of course I really don't have any way of forcing anyone's "hand"
even if I were to make the rash move to distribute Aldor source code.
The legitimit owners of Aldor could certainly assert their rights no
matter what action I take. The best I can hope to do is to make it
clear how important I think this issue is.

Nor do I think of this as asking for a personal favor since I
probably have less intellectual investment and certainly less
financial investment in Axiom than many other people. I do however
expect that any rational person with the stated motivations would
have resolved these licensing issues long ago. Resolution is in
everyone's interest and open source licensing is clearly the best
option. By now this has been proven in many different situations.
Continued delay is harmful (maybe even fatal) to both Aldor and
Axiom.

Correct.

Yes.

That is entirely unclear to me. The Aldor Public License does not
distinguish between binary versus source code formats. It does state
specifically what one's obligations would be *if* one were to make
modifications to the source code. If you read the intention of the
Aldor Public License and the history section of the aldor.org web
site, it gives the distinct impression that Aldor in toto is publicly
available.

But as Tim said in his earlier message: we are not lawyers so
arguing about wording is rather pointless.

As far as I can see it was aldor.org's decision simply to withhold
the source code from the distribution, possibly with the (good)
intentions of controlling modifications to the source. I think this
happened before the open source development model became as well
established as it is today. People just did not know how well it
would work to allow open updating of publicly accessible source
code repositories. Contrary to some fears, it has not resulted
in "chaos". Instead we now have versions of linux that are more
than competitive with both closed source unix and Windows. And
companies like Sun are scrabbling to open their previously closed
source products at quickly as possible.

I still don't consider it viable in spite of the fact that (finally!)
we do have some developers (Gaby and Waldek) who are capable and
perhaps motivated. After all, some estimates say that it took over
$1,000,000 and more than 3 man-years to develop Aldor and this was
done by people directly involved in the Axiom/ScratchPad project.

I think you greatly exaggrate. Everyone has already publicly stated
that they agree with making Aldor open source.

We have been doing that for some time now.

Have you read the Aldor Public License? It looks pretty much like
GPL to me.

However, since this is apparently not the case (I assume the compiler
source code is somewhere other than in the distribution) it must be
assumed that this omission was intentional until proven otherwise.  The
fact that there is a lot of work going on behind the scenes on this
would seem to confirm the issue is not straightforward.

True.

Which is probably why there IS still work going on to make it happen. 
I can readily accept that the legal aspects of this are not simple to
work through.  Mike Dewar's update that there is still work in progress
is very encouraging to me.

True.  Whether open source could duplicate such an effort is in my mind
an open question.

Yes, but the viability of open source rests on a healthy respect for
copyright and legality.  Morally, re-licensing the code willy-nilly
would be about the same as taking GPL code and incorporating it into a
commercial product.  Even if the original authors had said that might
be acceptable under the right conditions, doing it without their
explicit approval would be a Bad Idea.  Aldor.org and NAG MUST be
allowed to do as they please with their work, the same as we are
allowed to do what we please with our own.  Any violation of that trust
and respect is very dangerous to the community, to say nothing of
relations with NAG (who after all didn't have to do any of this in the
first place.)

I would have to hear a professional legal opinion to convince me there
is any other option here.  It seems quite straightforward - if
Aldor.org and NAG say "not yet", that's the last word.  It's their
code.

This part looks like it might not be GPL compatible:

(b) you grant Aldor.org a royalty-free license to use, modify or
redistribute your modifications without limitation

"without limitation" would seem to me to mean you are granting rights
to Aldor.org over and above those of the GPL.  Again though, this is
one of those lawyer questions. (Sorry Tim.)  Let's say Aldor.org wants
to release a commercial version of Aldor - under this license, they can
incorporate any work based off the Aldor code into a closed source
binary distribution.  (That's not to say they would do so, of course,
but legal documents are where people are supposed to consider worst
case scenarios.)

Anyway, Mike Dewar and Dr. Watt are still working on it, which is
excellent news and may render this whole discussion moot.

Cheers,
CY

Yes, there is a cvs source archive on another aldor.org machine
that is accessible only to users with an account on that machine.
The binary distribution (several versions) is available for free
download as a tarball (after you agree to the Aldor Public License).
The tarball *does* not include the C source code of the compiler
nor the source code of some runtime libraries.

The copy of the Aldor source code that I obtained after I contacted
Steven Watt last year (August 2005) when I wanted to re-compile
Aldor for use on x86-46 hardware did not come with any license
statement nor a non-disclosure agreement of any kind. However I did
not obtain it through "normal" channels (assuming that such does in
fact exist) since Steven himself did not reply to my request until
several months later (October 2005) at which time he wrote:

"I've taken a bit longer to respond than planned because we are now
contemplating adopting a complete open source license for everyone.
This might take a bit of time, however, so it might make sense to
go ahead on an individual basis with you beforehand."

> it must be assumed that this omission was intentional until

Yes, of course it was intentional. A plausible reason for this
in spite of the existence of the Aldor Public License and that
Aldor is freely and publicly available in binary format is the
desire to control the official source. Unfortunately aldor.org
did not seem to realize that such control kills almost all desire
for innovation on the part of others. Very little has been done
to Aldor since it's release by aldor.org - even bug fixes seem
to be mostly ignored.

What gives you the idea that "there is a lot of work going on
behind the scenes"? I see no real evidence of that. Can you give
any example other than the communication to which Mike Dewar
recently referred? Remember that it has taken more than a year
since Steven Watt first said publicly that work was underway
to make Aldor open source for the process to reach this stage.

Also, I fail to see why the issues is not straightforward.
Everyone involved has already indicated they are in favour of
making Aldor open source. No one has spoken in favour of keeping
Aldor source code closed.

Could you give an example of such a "legal aspect"?

Yes, to me too. But the delay is really deadly. In my opinion we
(the Axiom project) would have been much better off if we had
known two or three years ago whether or not Aldor was going to
be part of Axiom or not. If the answer had been "no", we would be
struggling but at least work would now be well underway to improve
SPAD and to write new algebra code. If the answer had been "yes"
then the work to re-write the Axiom algebra library would likely
be near completion and many people would be involved in writing
new algebra code. But because there has been no decision for so
long, the result is that nearly everything concerning the algebra
is "on hold" and otherwise enthusiastic people (such as those
developing Sage right now) don't want to touch Axiom because of
the overwhelming amount of legacy code and uncertainty about
Aldor - the only interesting part to many people with a computer
science orientation. (Gaby being a fortunate exception :-)

I doubt that. It seems to me that the original open source projects,
especially those originating from the Free Software Foundation,
were driven by people who wanted to change the existing status quo
of legally proprietary software. There are many philosophical
arguments about why software should be free of the constraints
of usual copyright and licensed in such as way as to impose this
condition on anyone willing to modify and re-distribute it. Many
people considered this borderline illegal. Witness the Unix law
suite only just recently resolved.

As far as I am concerned the viability of open source rests on
volunteers. I expect that what motivates volunteers ranges widely
but none of those whom I have spoken to had much respect for
anything that prevents them from working on their chosen project
or for that matter any commercially motivated group who uses
licensing and copyright to limit open access to source code
(currently Microsoft and Apple, formerly Sun and IBM), which of
course is not to be interpreted as my saying they are willing to
do anything illegal.

I think the apparent preoccupation with licenses and legal opinions
of people working in open source is only in response to challenges
to this freedom by commercial proprietary interests.

There is nothing legal about using GPL code in a commercial product.
Of course it carries the obligation that the source code of the
commercial product must be open source, but contrary to most
"corporate expectations", open source code has not proven to be
a detriment - quite the contrary. "Commercial" should not be
confused with proprietary or "closed". For example consider Red
Hat Enterprise Linux, Sun's StarOffice (aka. OpenOffice) and IBM's
webserver products based on Apache. This is likely to be the norm
in the future rather than the exception.

Well, yes copyright law does require the permission of copyright
holders. Violating the wishes of the copyright holders could
leave one open to a law suit but Tim has already explained why
such action is very unlikely.

There is a risk I suppose that, since NAG retains the copyright on
Axiom (see Axiom license), that they might choose to re-license
Axiom at some point in the future. But that would not retroactively
affect any versions of the Axiom that had already been released
under the existing license.

Which license? As far as I can tell, what I was proposing in terms
of releasing Aldor source under the Aldor Public License would
conform perfectly with that license. Releasing Aldor under GPL
would be more restrictive but compatible with the Aldor Public
License.

Well, this is posted on "axiom-legal" which is the place where Tim Daly
says we should keep confine such discussions. As such I feel more free
to speak of these issues here than I would in any other Axiom forum.
I am not a lawyer but I can argue about how many angels fit on the head
of a pin just as well as the next guy. :-)

I think you should not take "without limitation" out of context. This
is part of the Aldor Public License which specifically makes such
modifications public. That would be similar to what is already allowed
in Axiom under the current modified BSD license (which is considered
compatible with GPL). The rights assigned to Aldor.org are compatible
with GPL in the same sense in which BSD is compatible.

I certainly hope so. :-)

Or even kills the ability to use it.  I'm running GNU/Linux with glibc
2.4; that isn't one of the four OSs that Aldor runs on.  Unless I
downgrade the software on my computer, I can't use Aldor.

Well, I don't know the company policies, contracts, or other issues
specific to NAG so anything I say would be no more than speculation. 
However, things I can see as being possibly relevant would be business
agreements licensing source to include in the compiler, agreements in
the past not to release some of the code, trade secret concerns,
liability concerns, and probably others I'm forgetting.  Axiom itself
would suggest the possibility that business agreements with IBM might
be relevant.

Are any of these a risk?  We don't know - insufficient information. 
But before proceeding I can see it as being quite reasonable that such
issues need to be thoroughly checked.  Remember, there is no revenue
stream here to help pay for any sort of legal activity.  IF lawyers are
being consulted (who knows?) then a time frame of a year wouldn't
surprise me in the least, particularly when the issue at hand is not
critical to the revenue stream.

Well, we would be further along anyway.  I think a truly literate
re-write of the Axiom algebra library (e.g. make each pamphlet into a
publication worthy summary/paper/history as well as code) would be the
work of decades, but that might be just me overestimating the effort
involved (even if it is that long of a project, I still view it as
worth doing).  I still think a lot of that work is probably doable even
without knowing the final language (paper writing can precede code, and
perhaps it should anyway in order for the author to have the knowledge
to write the code well) but the uncertainty over project direction does
tend to have a harmful impact.

I think the legacy code is its own problem, Aldor or not.  There is
lots of really smart code and design ideas in Axiom - the problem is
recognizing it and separating that from things like that hideous lisp
packages nightmare.

Sure, but the legal system is the ultimate trump card - they are the
only ones who can say "stop doing that" and back it up.  Naturally such
power is treated with respect.

My mistake - make it closed source and commercial.  The situation I had
in mind was not commercial open source software, but software that
wishes to remain closed incorporating GPL code and selling it without
releasing back the changes.  This has been done before - I think PearPC
had some problems with that in the past (CherryOS?), to name one
example.

I think releasing code that has not been released under any license
would provoke a MUCH stronger response than subtle issues about Aldor
Public License vs. GPL.  Nor would I fault such a response - while
questions about APL vs. GPL are in good faith, releasing unreleased
code is an unambiguous affront to the copyright holder.

Well, look at it this way then - if the Aldor source were to become
available under circumstances where it was not clear NAG approved, no
one would develop it or use it.  Nor would they release it through
legitimate avenues, effectively killing ANY chance for a truly free
Aldor compiler short of a rewrite.  ReactOS had some problems with the
means people were using, and had to do a full source tree audit.

Debatable.  Anyway, stated intent to release code is not the same as
actually doing it - the assumption cannot and should not be made that
it can be released.

As Mike has already mentioned, if people weren't interested in getting
this done a simple statement that it wouldn't be done would keep their
inboxes neater.  There may be reasons for the delay that they can't
talk about legally, and given that they have released Axiom to us in
the past I think we owe them the benefit of the doubt.  Yes the delay
is harmful but there are things we can do in the meantime - writing the
academic papers needed to describe the existing mathematical domains in
Axiom doesn't necessarily need to wait on the language decision, at
least to start.

Cheers,
CY

Do not blame others for your own mistakes. From day one in Axiom
community I am advocating using and enhancing (and fixing) the already
existing Axiom (old) *free* compiler. (To my eyes non-free code does
not even exist and is doomed to join the trash.) I have been
constantly contradicted by people like you (and Ralf if I do not
mistake) who where 'waiting for Aldor', the 'future' of Axiom. Now you
measure the failure of your option. This way of seeing things (not
fixing the current compiler) has pissed me off and has (for the
moment) much lowered my interest in Axiom ('waiting for Aldor' as it
seems it ever has been since I known it, commercially or as a free
software project, but more than 10 years have passed since then...).

For your own information, I have looked into the old compiler to see
if I was able to fix things I consider critical (being able to have
variables instead of constants in domains and category calls,
something Aldor is able to do). I felt very alone at that time (it was
before Gaby's involvment and everybody was looking for a wiki, and /
or a graphical interface in Java at that time). I have to confess I
have not been able to understand sufficently well how the old compiler
does work to be able to fix it (I am not the right person for this
kind of job). Future will tell if such tasks will be achieved and will
resurrect my interest for Axiom.

I find your own attitude (petition, threat of violating their rights
on the code) with respect to NAG and other Aldor copyright owners very
rude and unacceptable. A very bad example from the free software
community that does to encourage companies to participate in free
software project and communities.

So you have never spoken to me.   :-)

I think you think wrong. So let's conclude we disagree.  :-)

I suppose you meant 'illegal' or 'proprietary' (otherwise, it is
nonsense).

So let's do it? You will never been followed by the rest of the larger
free software community.

(It is already their right as copyright owners today.) And that would
not affect the contributions they would not be able to keep without
explicit consent of their respective authors.

Releasing a code under GPL with binary blobs without their source is
contradicting the GPL itself (and makes the code undistributable).

Honestly I only look at what they have already achieved (actually
publish Axiom as open source). The promises do not count. Only for
those who want to believe them and they may hurt more than those who
dwell on them.

ok. you may be legally right or legally wrong. 
i have no opinion about that.

"legal" actions and resorting to lawyers has always felt to me
like being threatened, pushed, and shoved. it's about fear of
being sued. fear of consequences from "reasonable actions" being
turned against you. lawyers are in the fear producing business.
licensing and "legality" are childhood ghosts with no substance
except your own fear that "someone" will steal all you have.

but that's not the issue at stake here. it's not really about law.
it's never about the law.

when i contemplate your action it really comes down to this....

respect.




if it frustrates you enough to want to publish the source code
send Stephen a note and tell him that you plan to do this. give
him the courtesy of notice and a chance to respond. and if he
explicitly says no then you need to respect his decision.

in theory he could sue you. he won't. NAG won't. nobody will,
for all of the reasons i gave.




gentlemen respect each other. Stephen may respect your opinion
and agree with you. but if Stephen decides to disagree you need
to respect his opinion.

Stephen's failure to respond to the community is costing him
dearly on a professional level and he is gradually losing the
respect he richly deserves, losing it one day at a time. but
publishing the code without direct request will cost you also.
you will lose the respect of the community.

frankly, it isn't worth it.

respectfully yours,
t

Aldor is "almost free" (perhaps you will claim that there is no
such thing?). Many people have copies of the Aldor source and
binary versions are publicly available.

Actually Aldor is the past of Axiom. Aldor was developed by the
same IBM research group that developed Axiom. And Aldor (then
named AXIOM/XL) was a part of Axiom the last time Axiom was
available as a commercial product. And a significant amount of
work has already been done to convert the Axiom library to Aldor.

But you are wrong that I am against the improvement of SPAD. I
just believe that it is too difficult a problem for a volunteer-
based open source project. Apparently it was even too difficult
for the original Axiom developers. That is why they wanted to
develop Aldor.

Is Aldor really able to do that? Wouldn't that violate the principle

But you are making a mistake. Petitions for open source are very
common. That more than 50 people have stated publicly via the online
petition that they think open source Aldor is a good idea (including
Steven Watt, the primary developer of Aldor). As to "threats of
violating their rights", I think you greatly overstate the situation.
Since everyone agrees that Aldor should be open source, I was only
proposing a way to proceed - open the code now and fix the licensing
issues later.

To me it is a matter of making best use of (potentially) available
intellectual investment. Right now both Axiom and Aldor are suffering
because what was meant to be together was "sold" separately.

I do not have any. And am I not interested in having it *as it is not
free software* (what could I do from it, not having enough interesting
rights).

Note that in the past (1999) when Axiom was "almost free" (we had
access to all the libraries but not the source of some binary parts in
the core system) I have been severly beaten (during the last months of
my PhD) by some (faulty) binary only parts. At that time I have
sweared (thanks to my Axiom very bad experience) to ever use again
only *really* free software. Please understand why I am so picky about
freeness of anything. It is not a goal. But a prerequisite from where
anything is possible.

See how much time you are waisting with non-free Aldor.

Have you used Aldor at that time? I have been waiting from 1995 to
1999 for Aldor to become usable for reasearch which it has never
achieved (and by far). Aldor might be a funny pet project (as could be
Mathemagix or SAGE) that could grow into something interesting (as is
SAGE today). But as it is not free software, I DO NOT CARE (and I
deeply regret it is favored instead of Axiom old compiler in the Axiom
community). It is now too late for Aldor. It has missed its time frame
and opportunity (now filled by SAGE). I would be sad it were the same
for Axiom because everybody has its eyes (wrongly) focused on
Aldor. Maybe it is already too late...

Many "failed" projects during their commercial life turn into free
software (this is what occurred to Axiom). Maybe Aldor is not failed
enough to become free sofware (but, ironically, I believe you actually
never had so much chance to have Aldor finally released as free
software).

I am actually sad we have not driven enough lisp gurus to fix the
compiler. But (re)writing a compiler from scratch is an industrial
project the (free) Axiom community is far from being able to consider.

It is supposed to. What I mean is being able to create domains in
compiled code with variables in their parameters (not change the value
of the variable after instantiation). With this much of the Galois
field factorisation of Axiom would be much easier to write *and
maintain* (currently, it is a kind of hack using the integers and
contradicting the grounding principles of Axiom).

I think it boils down to what Tim has summarized better than I
could. It is only a matter of respect. Respect THEIR choice and draw
you own conclusions from it.

In French we have =AB un tiens vaut mieux que deux tu l'auras =BB which
sounds like "better now than tomorrow" and "promises are for those
willing to believe them". The reality is what we really have. The rest
is literature.

Aren't there any binary blobs. It is even sadder for them (not to be
free)...  :)

This is where we differ. You are taking into account potentialities
(which make you not to move on the old compiler front) whereas I am
only considering reality.

By waiting long enough, you increase your chances to finally be
right. But the delay might be much too long to go anywhere on the road
to the 27 year horizon. (Time flies, you know?)

You could compile your own binary for the hardware of your choice.
(I did this for x86-64 bit linux.) You could read and learn more
about the compiler. You could fix bugs in the compiler for your own
use. Only (apparently) you cannot re-distribute it to others. Although
that seems to depend on how you interpret the Aldor Public License.

Yes in 1999 I used the Aldor compiler that was part of the Windows
version of Axiom that was distributed by NAG. However I only had a
copy of the promotional Cdrom which contained a time-limited license
manager. I was comparing it to Maple which I already knew fairly well.
I nearly purchased Axiom at that time from NAG but compared to Maple
Axiom seemed too slow. (On common hardware available today and the
changes in Maple since that time I am sure that it would now seem
much faster than Maple.) But I really liked the Axiom language and
the Windows TeX browser interface.

I think you just missed the time.

Aldor was packaged commercially with Axiom by NAG. I do not think
it is accurate to describe it as a "pet project".

Maybe. As you know I am also very interested in SAGE. I wrote
an interface for Axiom in SAGE. SAGE uses Python as the main
development language and that has some big advantages as well as
a few drawbacks. I am concerned however that the SAGE developers
are not learning as much from past experience as they should. As
a result they are re-inventing some wheels (despite their motto)
and repeating some of the same mistakes. If they had open access
to Aldor I think it might be possible to influence some of their
design choices.

Still, I think SAGE is an exciting project and the AXIOM project
should plan to work with them. I agree that SAGE sets a good
example by insisting that every part of SAGE is open source.

No, there are some Axiom people who are not waiting for Aldor.

I agree. When you compare Lisp to Python (as used in SAGE) - not
the languages but rather the community), then it is clear that
Lisp is part of the problem. When I spoke to SAGE developers about
Axiom and I mentioned Lisp their eyes "glazed over" and then smiled
until I pointed out that when Axiom was originally developed Lisp
was about as old as Python is now during the development of SAGE.

I think you could expect a lot of help on this from Ralf Hemmecke
and Martin Rubey. I am not entirely sure what you mean by "variables
that do not change value after instantiation". I think this is the
definition of a constant. So what you want to do should be possible.

My conclusion is that their choices (or actually rather lack of
choice) has had a very negative impact on Axiom. I want them to
stop this and license Aldor properly.

Yes, I am sympathetic to your point of view but for me right now
this is too conservative. I want more and it is close enough that
I feel it.

You will recall that when I first proposed this last March, I did
in fact send exactly such an email to Stephen. He did not reply.
I was prepared to proceed with the plan until Mike Dewar responded
to my email which contained a copy of what I sent to Stephen. I
understand that Mike has as much right to object to this course
of action as anyone else associated with aldor.org. Right?

Actually I think his publications speak extremely well of him no
matter what the situation with Aldor. I do deeply respect his work
on computer algebra and his research group at the University of
Western Ontario. I think they do very good and interesting work.

Ok, that's makes it at least 5 against my proposal and none for
it. I lay it to rest. But I am not finished yet...

--------

I know there are quite a lot of people who actually already have a
copy of the Aldor source code. Perhaps some even still have access
to the original cvs archive. Probably many don't. Suppose that we
were to try to establish an "amnesty" for all people who currently
hold copies of Aldor? Some people may even have local changes which
fix some bug or add some new feature that was needed in their own
work. For whatever reason they may not have wanted or may not have
had the chance to contribute these changes to aldor.org.

We could invite them to join a new "Aldor for Axiom" Developer Group
and provide a new closed source code repository containing a copy
of the Aldor sources in /trunk from which developers could establish
their own branches. The stated purpose of this group would be to
prepare new binary versions of Aldor specifically for use with Axiom
on the various platforms on with Axiom runs. This version of Aldor
would be included in binary form with the Axiom source code
distribution in order to allow all Axiom users the option to use
Aldor as the library compiler.

Verification that someone already had a copy of Aldor could be
done for example, by asking them to provide some selected phrase
from the source referenced only by location as a password to the
repository.

The source code itself would not be publicly distributed outside of
the Aldor for Axiom developer group but under the terms of the Aldor
Public License, all changes to the code would be made available to
aldor.org and also made available for public access in the form of
changesets against /trunk. Of course authors of the changes would
be properly accredited with the changes that they submit.

I believe that this new proposal would not violate in any way either
the spirit or the letter of the existing licensing conditions for
Aldor. If or when aldor.org does release an official open source
license for Aldor, the Aldor for Axiom repository could then be made
available under the terms of this new license.

Actually, I have absolutely no idea how many potential developers
and Axiom users would be willing to accept these conditions, but I
think it might be worth a try. At the very least it would keep alive
the possibility of using Aldor with Axiom.

Hi Bill,

I believe I am starting to be slightly off-topic for axiom-legal with
this message, so I think it will be my last contribution to this
thread.

Hence others cannot fix bugs for me and I cannot fix them for
others. Seems very far from free software to me and above all far from
scientific research.

Time spent in a free sofware project is never wasted (most of the
time) as long as you have other people using it.

Yes at that time it was after Axiom moved from the (faster) AKCL
(because of is GPL licence) to the other Lisp that allowed porting to
Windows. This move from one Lisp to an other caused Axiom to be more
than twice as slow as it was before (even worse in some
operations). This slowness was the cause of the (dirty) workarounds in
the (old) compiler that caused the (several) breakages I experienced.

Most of the efforts of NAG at that time were on porting Axiom to
Windows (with more work on the interface). So my experience as a Unix
user (as were most of the Axiom users in France at that time) of Axiom
was:

  * a slower compiler (twice as slow as a few months before) for
bytecode compiling
  * development effort all focused on Windows (and Aldor)
  * a compiler subtly (and secretly) broken (it took me some time to
figure out what was actually happening).

And you wonder how the French Axiom community was killed? Fortunately,
this turn of events killed (old) Axiom as a commercial product and NAG
made a great contribution to free software by freeing Axiom (thanks to
Tim and other people involved).

Funnily, one of the first patches of the new free Axiom was to put
back GCL as compiler. But it was several years later...

And the libraries (I should have written... or rewritten as did late
Manuel bronstein), and the debbuging, and... Sorry, I am ready to do
this for any free project, but not for a non-free project with an even
more unclear roadmap.

And so what? Aldor has been announced in the symbolic community since
1995. Its technical (and licensing) choices and merits have been much
discussed and challenged. I know of at least two projects that wanted
to design and achieve the same goals as Aldor in a more proper way (to
their eyes):

  * Mathemagix (Joris van der Hoeven)
  * Focal (Renaud Rioboo et al.)

(Those people come from the -- old -- Axiom community.)

Nowadays, SAGE seems to be the closer to achieve the same goals as
Mathemagix (and Aldor) but with very different technical choices.

I completely agree with you on this (and appreciate the work you are
doing there).

I completely disagree. Aldor design (it is already publicly available)
might be interesting as food for thought. Aldor as a compiler is
closer to what should not be done. So I am not starving from it. (And
I do not think people with Python background will be...)

So do I. I would not disagree Axiom should try to keep Aldor
compatibility (when possible) but we should NEVER dwell on or wait for
it.

I do not read in their minds. I simply check the facts. It reminds me
of an other project: Scilab (of INRIA) which is constantly claimed to
be free software (which it is not). I bet it is a strategic choice of
INRIA (and that it will never be free). I would not be surprised for
Aldor to do the same, so I do not hold my breath (actually, it is what
it is already doing).

It seems that their eyes do no "glaze over" Maxima, though.  :-)

Let's beeing specific:

    PrimeField(7)

and

    PrimeField(p)

both work in interpreted mode whereas the second one is not compiled
by the old compiler (it has already been discussed some time -- years
-- ago on axiom-dev).

No. Only your wanting to (wait for and) fix this has had a negative
impact on Axiom (and might still have more).

You cannot blame others for your own choices. Still the question of
respect.

If you get Aldor as free software, You will have one more source of
waste of time (and debbuging, and integration, and so on...). It will
not speed up the Axiom developement pace but lower it much on the
contrary. (I do not believe there is a valuable Aldor only community
ready to join us, otherwise we would already see them in Axiom.)

There is not any issue that cannot be finally solved by doing nothing.
