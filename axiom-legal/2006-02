Hmm.  I guess that's true, so long as Aldor.org didn't want to ever
release a commercial binary only version using someone else's
derivative work.  My recollection was that they do have that right
under the Aldor license, but IANAL (as they say on slashdot).  And of
course it's unlikely they would exercise it in that fashion,
particularly given the current state of the Aldor project...

I think Aldor.org has complete rights to any derivative work based off
of aldor, not just the right to open up the code.  GPL wouldn't work
there, since it would allow derivative work code to prevent its
inclusion in an commercial Aldor.org release w/o source code.  While
Aldor.org might not have intended things to have this meaning, if I'm
not mistaken thats the effect the license has, and GPL is definitely
incompatible with that.  A more informed opinion than mine would be
welcome here.

Well, there is that of course, but I was mainly thinking that we could
get more "core" work done with both design decisions and coding if we
hedged our bet that Aldor will eventually be released.

Unfortunately, I agree.  Yuck.

It makes sense, but if I'm reading that right the Aldor license just
doesn't permit it - maybe GPL + full rights to Aldor.org would work.

Definitely true.

> The question is: what is the greater risk for the Axiom project?

For the moment, I would say we make it easy to install against an
existing Aldor, provide good instructions how how to get it installed,
and leave it at that, I guess.  Anybody messing with Aldor at this
point will have the skillset to get it working from the instructions to
begin with.

Cheers,
CY

P.S.  I don't suppose we could try to decompile
(http://boomerang.sourceforge.net/,
http://www.backerstreet.com/rec/rec.htm) Aldor?  Does the license or
legal situation forbid that?  It wouldn't be pretty but at least it
would be source code.

Well as I understand the license it says. If a person A distributes 
modified forms of whatever you take from aldor.org, he must follow the 
modified BSD that is stated in the first 3 items of the Aldor Public 
License 1.0.

The additional fourth item says that A has to submit the modified work 
to aldor.org and let them do with it whatever they like. They could 
release it under any license close it and/or sell it.

If A chooses to release the modifications (and the orignal source code)
again under APL1.0 (I think the fourth item carries over) in source 
form, then whatever aldor.org does with the modified work, it stays open 
source. That basically sounds like a fork or like distributing identical 
software under different licenses.

I am not really agains giving back modifications to aldor.org. The idea 
probably is that there should not be diverging versions of the Aldor 
language. Note that the aldor language could still be slightly modified 
to meet peoples needs. Stephen Watt already had some ideas when I last 
spoke to him two years ago. (Unfortunately there are no people who 
implement that.)

Aldor has the concept of libraries and there is libaldor and libalgebra, 
basically which are under APL1.0. If one changes them, then the code 
currently must be given back to aldor.org. If you write another library 
which just uses those libraries, then this new library can be released 
without the need to hand it to aldor.org. So that basically says, if we 
turn libaldor and libalgebra into pamphlets (correct bugs, add a 
testsuite) that should be given back to aldor.org. If we build libaxiom 
on top of libalgebra, then aldor.org cannot claim any rights on that code.

Who interprets the Aldor Public License differently?

>> The issue might eventually be who can incorporate Aldor into

Anyone can do this (close the source) under the APL1.0 as long as they 
give the sources to aldor.org. However, aldor.org is allowed to release 
these sources.

> I think Aldor.org has complete rights to any derivative work based off

No. the APL does not state derivative work, only "modifications". A new 
library (libaxiom) based on either libaldor or libalgebra is not a 
modification of of them.

Given that Stephen Watt is in favour of opening the Aldor compiler, we 
should discuss of how the Aldor library sources could be integrated as a 
basis of Axiom. I would like that.

But even if the APL allows us redistribution, I would inform aldor.org, 
in particular Stephen Watt that we are going to do this. The Aldor and 
Axiom projects should stay on good terms with each other and eventually, 
maybe, become just one project (consisting of several subprojects).

>> But I think we have to consider this strategy carefully - 
>> particularly the licensing issues.

Leave the code from aldor.org under the APL, that doesn't hurt. But we 
modify it by putting it into pamphlet form. Oh, I'd love to see ALLPROSE 
be of some help here. :-)

I think that one could assume that people who want to program in Aldor 
know how to install it. But it would also be possible to take the .tgz 
files from aldor.org and install the right binaries (the Aldor compiler) 
during the installation of Axiom. The library sources would be in a 
separate aldor/src subtree of Axiom as .pamphlets. The APL would allow 
that as I see it. But it would always be friendly to tell Stephen Watt 
about what we are going to do.

I am against decompilation. Not that I see that APL would forbid it, but 
the aldor compiler surely has some bugs and they would remain there for 
centuries probably because the source code is then even more unreadable 
as it is now, I guess.

Yes, that is exactly what I meant. Of course we cannot and do not
wish to interfere with any of the rights currently held by
Aldor.org. What Aldor.org does with Aldor would still be up to
them. What I am contemplating is the parallel distribution of Aldor
sources as part of the Axiom project. In that case I am arguing
that we might be able to safely do this provided that we choose
an open source license that is compatible with but more conservative
than the current Aldor license.

So far all we know about the Aldor license is what applies to the
binary and (some source) parts of Aldor. But the license specifically
states that there are some source parts of Aldor that are not part
of that distribution. The implication elsewhere on the Aldor.org
web site is that a separate "source license" is also available
(only by special request) which covers the rest of the Aldor source.
As I understand it, it is this latter source license which will
eventually be converted to some form of open source license for
all of Aldor and available publicly.

*If* we were to distribute Aldor source code as part of or in
parallel with the Axiom open source distribution then we would
just be doing this in advance of the actual "official" open source
release of Aldor by Aldor.org.

Regards,
Bill Page.
