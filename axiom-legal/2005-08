Open source I do not know (depends on the chosen definition) but free
(as in freedom) software certainly not.

If no rights are given to you by a license coming along the software
then you shall read it as "all rights reserved" by the traditional
copyright laws.  Which prevents you, among others, from redistributing
it.

If the author wishes to share is software but has no clue about
licensing issues, then you might suggest him to pick a free software
license (like a 3 clause BSD license -- like axiom -- or GPL or
whatever in http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html, prefer the
most common ones).

By the way, software implemented in Java are usually quite complicated
to make working with free software Java compilers (somewhat lacking).

Best regards,
Frederic Lehobey
