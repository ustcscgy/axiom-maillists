Dear Axiom Users and Developers;

Earlier in October Tim Daly asked me if I would be able to move the Axiom wiki:

    http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

and the Axiom portal:

    http://portal.axiom-developer.org

web applications to a new server. The server where they have resided
for the last three years is a shared virtual server located at a
privately operated ISP. During the entire time Tim has paid for the
operation of this server from his own personal financial resources.
Meanwhile Tim's priorities for the original Axiom project have been
clarified and two new forks of Axiom (FriCAS and OpenAxiom) have been
created as a result. As implementer of the wiki and portal
applications on the axiom-developer server (based on the 'mathaction'
and 'LatexWiki' extension of ZWiki), I have argued that these
applications should actually support all of the existing Axiom-related
projects (Axiom, FriCAS, OpenAxiom and Aldor on Axiom) developers and
users as well as continue to provide interfaces for Reduce, Maxima,
and Sage. But Tim has decided that he would rather devote the
resources of the axiom-developer.org server to more Axiom-project
specific activities and also (if possible) reduce the cost of
operation of this server. This is certainly his prerogative and it is
my intention to help him meet that goal with as little disruption to
people who current use these applications as possible.

As most of you probably already know, William Stein offered to host a
version of the Axiom wiki and Axiom portal applications on the large
multi-processor computer system that supports the Sage project. So I
have spent some time over the last couple of months re-implementing
mathaction and related software there. The software is not identical
to the software on axiom-developer.org but rather a long-needed
software upgrade based on the most recent release of ZWiki. As a
result, the specific look and feel of the new web sites is not
identical to the old ones. There are some missing features some of
which can be restored by special customizations of ZWiki (e.g. the
lefthand sidebar, the comment preview function and the Axiom menus at
the bottom of the edit page). Some of these I have not yet had time to
do and others I am considering alternative ways of doing something
similar but with less special customization. Also, due to lack of
time, I have moved only a subset of the web pages from the old sites
to the new one. This is true of both the wiki and portal sites.

In spite of this and in view of Tim's desire to complete the move as
soon as possible, I would like to invite everyone to begin using the
new sites now. They can be found at:

    http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org

and

    http://axiom-portal.newsynthesis.org

Don't be fooled by the domain name "newsynthesis.org". This is a
domain name that I own but the names 'axiom-wiki' and 'axiom-portal'
are actually mapped to the 'sage.math.washington.edu' server supplied
by William Stein. I intend to continue to make these names available
for Axiom-related use over at least the next 10 years. I chose this
approach in order to provide as conveniently short urls as possible
and also to permit the urls to remain the same and be remapped in case
of any possible future move of these applications.

For the time being, the applications at 'axiom-developer.org' will
continue to operate but at some point (final details still to be
determined) the old url names may be re-mapped to point at the same
site as the new ones (for search engine compatibility) before they are
eventually phased out altogether and the applications and associated
database removed from axiom-developer.org.

So I would like to encourage everyone who cares about Axiom (and/or
it's forks) and who is interested in wiki and portal support for these
projects to help with testing and re-populating the new sites as soon
as possible. After three years of operation of the Axiom wiki there
are a fairly large number of out-dated, poorly organized and possibly
irrelevant pages which probably should not be simply copied over to
the new site. I would be very very happy if some other Axiom users and
developers would agree to assist with this "shifting" and
re-organizing effort. Copying missing content between the sites can be
easily done by cutting-and-pasting the text from the 'edit' of the old
site to the corresponding 'edit' page of the new site. I would be
happy to discuss details, make suggestions and general try to help
anyone who wants to try this. These web sites are intended to be
community supported web sites and everyone is welcome and encouraged
to participate in making them as useful as possible to all Axiom users
and developers.

The most serious missing component at the new Axiom wiki site is the
existing database of IssueTracker reports. I have tried unsuccessfully
to copy to the old database to the new server. In any case it is also
true that a number of these reports may be obsolete or may not apply
equally to all of the Axiom projects. Also some of the Axiom projects
(forks) have their own way of tracking problems, e.g. OpenAxiom simply
uses SourceForge. So I am open to suggestions on how to proceed with
this transferring this information (and/or comments about whether this
is really necessary or not).

At this time Aldor is the only computer algebra program that has not
yet been installed on the new server. (Axiom, Maxima, Reduce, and Sage
are also working.) My current priority is to complete the build of
Aldor for Axiom so that it will be possible to run the Aldor example
code on the wiki pages again. My intention is to use the newest
version of FriCAS and the new open source release of Aldor. Some
things have changed since I did this last, so it may take a little
more time but this should be completed in the new few days.

And as usual, if you have any questions, comments, suggestions or
criticisms I would be glad to hear them.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear Bill,

I'm very grateful to you, even though I'm unhappy that axiom-developer.org will
not have the same contents in future.  Oh dear, I link to it in a paper...

These names sound quite good to me.  "new synthesis" has something optimistic!

Oh dear, that's too bad.  In fact, I'm quite shocked.  

I wanted to make the following suggestion already some time ago: If the three
projects intend to cooperate, I think it would be a very wise thing to have
only one database for bugs.

I like IssueTracker a lot, mainly, because it is so easy to demonstrate the
bug.  Since we have several projects now, it would be necessary though to be
able to select any subset of

fixed in Axiom
fixed in FriCAS
fixes in OpenAxiom

Since FriCas and Axiom refers to the IssueTracker numbers in the logfiles and
in source, it is a must (if possible) to keep the database numbering as is.

Do you know already whether transferring is a fundamental problem?


Many thanks again and good luck,


Martin

Right now on 'axiom-developer.org' email sent to
'mathaction@axiom-developer.org' containing a prefix in the subject
line such as

  Subject: [Moving] ...

is automatically added as a comment to the page named 'Moving' on the
Axiom Wiki. This works well for people who are subscribed to the wiki
so that that receive notices of new pages and edits with this same
return address.

This includes Names that begin with numbers, eg. [187 trouble with
tuples] which refer to issue tracker reports.

Doing this requires a special alias in the configuration of sendmail
on the server to pipe the content of the email to a particular method
called 'mailin' at the wiki url. I have not yet asked William Stein if
he is willing to allow this sort of 'mailin' processing on the
'sage.math.washington.edu' server. If so, then we can at least
temporarily redirect the old email address to the new one at for
example: 'mathaction@axiom.newsynthesis.org'

Alternatively we could just redirect 'mathaction@axiom-developer.org'
to some appropriate mailing list.

Any preferences?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill, I must admit that I have doubts concerning your migration
tactic.  AFAU there are two goals:

1) Primary goal: migrate content and users from the old site
   to the new site.
2) Secondary goal: update software and the content.

As you wrote: Axiom wiki is a comunity site, so migrating users
to the new site is crucial.  But to migrate users it is
essential to migrate content.  I took quick look at the new site
and I see that a large part (most??) of content is missing
-- for example most links on AxiomContributions page does not work
and many positions from the page on the old site are missing.

IIUC you propose to transfer rest of the content via cutting-and-pasting
from the old site.  I think this is problematic: without proofreading
almost any automatic procedure will work better.  You probably hope
that volunteers will proofread the content while copying.  However,
it seems that creating current content took about 3 years.  I would
expect that proofreading the site will take month or two and
proofreaders will be slowed down by the need to copy things --
I am not saying that proofreading itself takes a lot of time,
but simply that our volunteers are in general busy, and can spend
only a short time doing this.

During that time the new site will be more or less broken, so many
users will try to use the old site -- since only old site will
be "complete".  Similarly links will continue to point to the old
site.  Another problem is that users may come to the old place and
add content there -- migrating additions will cause extra trouble.

I would suggest to migrate content as much as possible in automatic
way.  Once the new site is fully functional I would made first
stage of transition:
-- put prominent notice about new site on the front page of
   the old site
-- change old site to read-only and display notice about new
   site on any attempt to edit
-- redirect all links to the new site.

In the next stage (two weeks or maybe month later) I would replace
all pages on the old site by a notice about move and link to
the corresponding page on the new site.  I would handle updates
to the content separately.

Rationalle: without proper action users will continue to come
to the old site: it shows in search engines, it is in bookmarks,
there are links to it.  The first stage is intended to shift
critical mass of links and users to the new site.  To avoid loosing
users old site should be operational.  Making old site read-only
should avoid problems with synchronization.  Redirecting links
should help with search engines and bookmarks -- search engines
should notice new site, new bookmarks to links will point to
the new site.

Concerning update of content: the move may cause some loss of
users.  Operating both sites in paralell is intended to minimize
user loss.  However, it is essential that new site is fully
operational -- otherwise users will go to the old site or we may
loose them.  IMHO trying to update content during migration
slows down migration and causes extra work.

FriCAS also has a bug tracker at SourceForge.  As a person reading
bug reports I find bugzilla format preferable compared to current
IssueTracker format.  More precisely:
-- bugzilla is more restrictive when comes to edits, for example
   for normal users is append-only and does not allow unautorized
   changes to metadata (bug classification)
-- IssueTracker shows Axiom output as images which is unsearchable,
   does not work on text terminal and may hide some important
   information 


However, I feel that access to old reports is important, so I certainly
would like to see old reports at the new site.

I belive that common bug tracker for all Axiom forks would be good.
In the past Tim said that he does not want FriCAS bugs in Axiom bug
tracker, so FriCAS bug tracker was created.  Certainly, common
bug tracker make sense only if one can restrict view so that
only bugs reported against given fork are visible.  Technically,
this should be not a problem...

Waldek, I very much appreciate your taking the time to comment. I also
have doubts as I will explain below. But I would state my own goals
with respect to the migration somewhat differently:

 Primary goal 1: Support all versions/forks of Axiom at one website
 Primary goal 2: Reduce the operating costs of the axiom-developer.org website
 Secondary goal 1: update software
 Secondary goal 2: migrate critical and selected content

The first three goals are well served by re-installing the web
applications at another site.
Notice I do not mention either updating content or migrating users.

I think we should be quite honest: There are very few users. Only
about 3 or 4 people have ever made any effort to actually use the web
site in the way it was intended - as a wiki, a community maintained
web site. I do not think there will be any problem convincing these
same people to continue to contribute to the new site.

On the other hand, from the log statistics we can see that the Axiom
wiki website does have quite a large number of visits by people who
want only to read something about Axiom and is also very actively
crawled by the major search engines. From my point of view, I think
the partial content that I have already copied from the old site to
the new is sufficient to sustain this sort of use of the site.

I do not understand your comment about proofreading. I suspect that
probably my reference to cut-and-paste was not very clear and that you
probably are not very familiar with how the content of the Axiom is
created and maintained. Cut-and-paste is simple. It involves only a
few steps and the entire content of a page is transferred and
re-created in essential one step by clicking Save.

Here is what I was hoping that you would do:

When you looked at the AxiomContributions page and noticed that some
apparently useful content was missing you could have added it with
less than 30 seconds effort. For example in detail:

1) At the new site

   http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/AxiomContributions

2) You see

  [CommonDenominator for polynomials]?

  where you would like to see a link to this web page that existed on
the old site.

3) Click on the blue ? to begin (re-)creating the page.

4) Open the source for this page at the old site in a separate browser window

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/CommonDenominatorForPolynomials/src

  Notice /src at the end of the url and also the rule of removing
blanks and capitalizing the first letter of each word.

5) Click Edit/Select All, Edit/Copy

6) Place the cursor in textbox in the page creation form and click
Edit/Paste to move the enter text of the page

7) Click the 'Create' button to render the new page. The link on the
AxiomContributions has been automatically updated.

Maybe during this process you notice that something is out of date so,
now you might continue by clicking 'edit' (upper right corner of page)
and make the correction.

> However,  it seems that creating current content took about 3 years.

I think a lot of this content is of out of date and no longer
interesting. I would prefer to place the emphasis on generating new
content and updating the old (if still relevant).

What is the purpose of proof-reading? Keep in mind that this is a
*wiki* web site. The content can be edited by anyone at any time and
this use is strongly *encouraged*. Editing and extending the content
is an ongoing process.

A wiki web site is never "complete". It is there to be changed,
updated and extended as time and motivation allow.

We can easily disable updates to the old site and direct the user to
the new site in the resulting error message page.

Because of the change in the underlying software I do not know any
easy way to accomplish this sort of automatic migration for the Axiom
wiki site. I have already done as much automatic migration to the
Axiom portal site as possible using the ZSyncer tool. If you have some
ideas about how to do more automatic migration I would be very
interested in this.

> Once the new site is fully functional I would made first
> stage of transition:

I do not know what you mean by "fully functional" except if you refer
to content as we discussed above. Other than that, I think the new
site is (almost) fully functional as a wiki and as a portal. The only
missing part right now that I know about as I mentioned in my previous
email is support for Aldor.

That is done now.

I can do that today if everyone agrees that is the right approach.

I think this would be inconvenient. The old site must remain
accessible for some period of to allow content to be transferred.

I do not think we have the luxury of spending this much time and using
this sort of more structured approach.

I do not know what is the required "critical mass" of links or users.
So far as I can see we have never reached this "critical mass" stage
in either links or users yet even on the old site.

Yes, but I do not expect the sites to every be anything except
approximately synchronized.

I think eventually redirecting links is definitely a good idea once
the old site is no longer accessible at all. In fact I can tell from
the web logs of the new site that the search engines have already
noticed and started to crawl the new site. They are very agressive
these days.

As I explained above, I think that this is quite normal for a wiki-based site.

Of course I have no problem if you chose that as the preferred method

Why do you think that is important? Do you expect such changes?

If desired Axiom output can be displayed in text form by including the commands:

)set output algebra on

But I do not understand why you would wish to use a "text terminal".

There are many good alternatives when it comes to bug tracking. For
example the Sage project is using the Trac system.

http://trac.edgewall.org

that includes it's own integrated wiki and interface to subversion.

Do you think we should try to operate something like this as a common
bug tracker for all the Axiom versions/forks?

Bill Page.

We are using different terminology here: for me people visiting the
site are users.  But I do not want discuss names here.  For me
important point of wiki is that content may be viewed by large
number of visitors.  And I belive that you want visitors to go
to the new site.

You wrote about obsolete pages: to find out if a page is obsolete
you need to read it.  And my impression is that 100% obsolete
pages are rare, rather part of a page is obsolete.  So to
eliminate obsolete pages and/or improve content you need
proofreading.

However below you explain that you just want mechanical copy...

OK, so we have easy way to grab sources of all pages from the old

This sound like work for Perl WW::Mechanize module.  However, since
you have direct access to the machine there should be easier way
to submit pages.  Note: I never used Mechanize module.  Since
I may need it for other purposes I am willing to try mass upload
using it (assuming you have no easier way).

I have no experience with Zwiki.  But I would be very disappointed if

Yes.

I think it is important to store _exactly_ the report: frequently
little details does not mater, but sometimes give very important
clue.  I saw report which looked like somebody later edited them
and reports were it was hard to distinguish what original reporter
wrote and what later folks added.  Which means that in _all_
cases there is danger that report was changed.  I guess one can
trace history of the page to check this, but it seems much
simpler to use append-only mode.
 
Concering metadata: there is a lot of bogus metadata in current
IssueTracker.  Part may be due to simple errors, but it seems
that wandals frequently change metadata.  I would say that
anuthorised people have no business changing metadata and
that maintaining metadata is less work than correctiong wrong
changes.

But that means that I would have to edit original report.  Beside
extra effort I would like to keep original report "as is".

BTW:  I _definitely_ prefer to store output of orignal report to
recreating it on page change.  Note that storing output avoids
all tricky issues with changing versions.

I have no experience with Trac.  I really have no strong preference
for specific software.  I mentioned Bugzilla because it is known
and works "good enough".  I belive that changing IssueTracker in
specific aspect I mentioned would not be very hard.  So, now
it is mostly question what other versions want.

Well, currently, there is no domain specially geared towards symbolic matrix
calculations, however:

* if you know the dimensions (and they are not too big), you do not have a
  problem at all, just use generic matrices

* otherwise, you can use a noncommutative polynomial ring, for example XPOLY:

(1) -> p1:XPOLY INT := x+y

   (1)  x 1 + y 1
                                                    Type: XPolynomial Integer
(2) -> p2:XPOLY INT := x-y

   (2)  x 1 + y(- 1)
                                                    Type: XPolynomial Integer
(3) -> p1*p2

   (3)  x(x 1 + y(- 1)) + y(x 1 + y(- 1))
                                                    Type: XPolynomial Integer
(4) -> p2*p1

   (4)  x(x 1 + y 1) + y(x(- 1) + y(- 1))
                                                    Type: XPolynomial Integer
(5) -> p1*p2-p2*p1

   (5)  x y(- 2) + y x 2
                                                    Type: XPolynomial Integer


* if you need more general expressions in variables, you will probably have to
  build your own domain, unfortunately.

Hope this helps,

Martin

Could you make your question more precise. I guess you already know what

Hello Martin, I test your new axiom.el mode.
And all *...

I can get the axiom.el file by :=20

cd /usr/local/axiom-local/mnt/linux/bin/lib/
./notangle ~/Axiom/AxiomEmacsMode.pamphlet > ~/Axiom/axiom.el

But I can't get the latex file by :

cd /usr/local/axiom-local/mnt/linux/bin/lib/
./noweb ~/Axiom/AxiomEmacsMode.pamphlet

I get the error. And I don't understand it...

<<*>> is not a good chunk name for noweb; use notangle instead
./noweb: line 31: cpif: command not found

So I don't know what is the [newline] key and the [compute-now] key...
When I test [ctrl-return], [alt-return]=A0and so I get errors :

Do you imagine what is wrong ?

Francois

(1) -> 11111     -- the return key is right.

      Perhaps you should use "@" to indicate the required return type,=20
      or "$" to specify which version of the function you need.

Try

noweave -n -delay AxiomEmacsMode.pamphlet > AxiomEmacsMode.tex

Martin, I don't understand why you give

   noweb axiom.el.pamphlet

as a suggestion in

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/AxiomEmacsMode.pamphlet

Francois, you can look at a precompiled file... (click on pdf)

Bill, why is that ....

yes, by default [return] is bound to evaluate.

> (2) -> )read /tmp/axiom44459nt.input    --- the [ctrl-return] key make errors

[ctrl-return] puts the front item of the kill ring in a temporary file and
")read" s it.  That way you can re-define easily function definitions you save
in an input file, without having to re evaluate the whole input file.


Of course, I'd be happy to have better - more emacs-like - keybindings,
although I must say I found them pretty much OK so far.

There is one important glitch in the mode currently:

I want to be able to override old input-output combinations. Several people
said that this would be useful.  However, it is quite difficult to detext, when
a computation has finished and new input is to be accepted.  In particular, I
do not really want to rely on the prompt appearing, since it might be desirable
to have "interactive" axiom commands, like pause() somebody (was it
Constantine?) is using already.  Also there are some system commands like 

   )di op 1

that ask the user a question, without displaying a prompt.

Ideas welcome.

Martin

Dear Axiom Fans,

The move of the Axiom Wiki and the Axiom Portal that was announced
last month is now nearly complete. Monday, November 26 is the official
date for the release of the new Axiom Wiki:

  http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org

and the new Axiom Portal

  http://axiom-portal.newsynthesis.org

which is now hosted on the Sage server operated by William Stein at
the University of Washington. On Monday the old urls:

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org      ** obsolete **

and

  http://portal.axiom-developer.org   **obsolete **

will be automatically re-directed to the new sites. Later that week,
all wiki and portal files will be removed from the axiom-developer.org
server. Tim Daly has plans that he will announce separately for
re-allocating resources on this server to focus on the goals of the
original Axiom project.

The new site is intended to support all three Axiom-related projects
(the original project plus OpenAxiom and the FriCAS forks), as well as
Aldor as a library compiler for Axiom. In addition to Axiom the wiki
and portal include interfaces for Reduce, Maxima and Sage. It also
supports pages containing noweb literate programs (pamphlets) and
graphics generated by graphviz.

All bug reports and issues from the old wiki site have been
transferred to the new site and an updated version of the customized
Topic navigation has been implemented at the new site (left sidebar).
The only feature that has not (yet) been implemented at the new site
is the point-and-click assistant extension of the edit and comment
forms. I am not certain whether this feature is really desirable since
in increases the size and there for the rendering time of every page
on the site. I would be glad to receive opinions about this.

If find any of your favorite pages from the old site are missing at
the new site, there is still time to transfer the page source from old
to the new. If you need help with doing this just let me know. Some of
the pages on the new axiom-wiki site do not yet reflect the current
state of the Axiom-related projects. Your help in updating the pages
at the new axiom-wiki site would be greatly appreciated.

If your were registered as a user of the old Axiom Portal site, your
account has *not* been automatically transferred to the new site. If
you have some files or other content that you wish to preserve and
transfer to the new site, please register at the new site:

  http://axiom-portal.newsynthesis.org

and if necessary ask me for help in transferring the content.

Regards,
Bill Page.
