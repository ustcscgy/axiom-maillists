All,

The Axiom type lattice is 20 layers deep (so far) and has roughly 800
of the >1000 domains classified. It is actually a graph rather than a
lattice as there are cycles (which have been flattened). We need to
check the correctness of the lattice once the algebra compiles. Does
anyone know of a program that can graph such a lattice?

Well, the primary documentation on Axiom is the book by Richard Jenks
and Robert Sutor "Axiom, The Scientific Computation System" 
Springer-Verlag, 0-387-97855-0 1992

The language used in Axiom is called Spad (a contraction of Scratchpad,
the original name for Axiom). During the Scratchpad days we decided to
rewrite the compiler (for the nth time, as both Axiom and its language
have always been an ongoing, evolving research effort). The result was
both the current internal spad compiler, that lives in the interpreter,
and an external stand-alone compiler written in C. The external compiler
accepts the spad language (modulo some constraints based on the fact
that it (a) doesn't have the lisp runtime and (b) can link to non-lisp
code). The external compiler went thru its own name evolution, called
A-sharp (A#), AxiomXL, and now Aldor. Aldor programs will run in Axiom
(assuming you don't use various non-axiom libraries, etc). Look at the
site www.aldor.org for details. www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap21.html
will bring you to a tutorial I wrote which shows how to create a
simple stand-alone polynomial type in Aldor.

The appropriate words you might want are at
http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap1.html#1

The {spad,aldor} language supports parameterized types (e.g. 
Matrix(Polynomial(Fraction(Integer))) , that is, an object can
be a Matrix of Polynomials with coefficients which are Fractions
of Integers) which are most useful in mathematics. In fact, types
carry all of the meaning of expressions. The expression 

G82322 (1) -> x:=matrix([[2,2],[2,2]])

        +2  2+
   (1)  |    |
        +2  2+

                                                         Type: Matrix Integer
creates a matrix of integers. Computing (x-x) should give you
the zero matrix, not the integer 0, as you will get in some systems:

G82322 (2) -> x-x

        +0  0+
   (2)  |    |
        +0  0+
                                                         Type: Matrix Integer


Strictly speaking, Axiom is not really an object oriented system in 
the sense of Smalltalk. In Smalltalk computing 2+3 means that you send the
"object" 2 the message "+ 3". In Axiom, 2+3 is computed by deciding that
"2" is of type PositiveInteger, 
"3" is of type PositiveInteger
"+" is a function that computes 
"+(PositiveInteger, PositiveInteger) => PositiveInteger"
and so it applies the function. 

Axiom, unlike Java, matches not only the argument types but also the
result type so the matching is much more explicit (that is, painful).

I would tend to argue, although not with much religious fire,
that Axiom is not an object oriented programming system or language.
However, it is entirely possible to think of the spad programs as
"classes" (in the java sense) with "methods" and a private data
representation. The whole type hierarchy, including all of the
dozens of data structures, can be thought of as an object-oriented
type hierarchy. Whether you want to do this depends on your religion.
I'm a hardcore lisper for most of my career and could care less :-)

As to the homepage of Axiom, yes, it lacks everything at the moment.
It will all be there eventually. I got a box of "system parts" from
NAG with various things missing due to legal constraints. The build
procedures and a general system cleanup are in progress and nearing
completion. Soon....

Hope this helps. If you have further questions, feel free to ask.

BTW: two questions:

1. Is there an estimate when there will be a first axiom (alpha :-°) 
release?

2. Why is axiom NOT part of the gnu project? Wouldn't you at least ask 
for something similar as (from aldor)

If you distribute a modified form of either source or binary code (a) you
must make the source form of these modification available to Aldor.org (b)
you grant Aldor.org a royalty-free license to use, modify or redistribute
your modifications without limitation, and (c) you represent that you are
legally entitled to grant these rights and that you are not providing
Aldor.org with any code that violates any law or breaches any contract.

(if there was a choice, I would find it great if axiom would become gpl, 
but presumably there are lots of legal issues I do not know about...)

I don't know but I'll check into that. Thanks.

The first release that includes compiled algebra code will happen this
weekend. I've finished the remaining domains and, except for a few
that failed to compile, the whole interpreter/compiler/algebra code
will be available to developers. Once some developers have
successfully compiled it I'll turn my attention to releasing the same
codebase on savannah. I've been working on a private CVS so I can make
my initial mistakes there. Now that Axiom compiles algebra from
scratch it is becoming usable. Of course, "usable" is questionable as
it is nowhere near the version that NAG shipped. Much work needs to be
done both to fix up the algebra layer, to build the rest of the code,
to clean up the docs, etc. However, the algebra is the important part.

I've done almost no checking of the code at any level except that it
compiles and builds properly. There is a tremendous amount of work
just to remaining to check the code so don't assume that this is a
finished release in any sense.

The code was released under modified BSD. That makes it both free and
open source in the technical sense. The GPL license was not chosen because
of various issues. Some of the discussion about the license still exists
at the original axiom site (www.earthlink.net/~jgg964/axiom.html).

Aldor is under its own license. Contact www.aldor.org for details.
The Aldor software is a separate effort of which, so far, I'm not a
developer.

I'm confused about the intent of the above parpagraph. Axiom source code
is (or will be) freely available to everyone. It isn't usable in the
current state as it is just a "box of parts". I'm automating the build
process so anyone can build a working system. This involves many (8, so far)
layers of code, some of it self-referencing and circular.

As the build procedures begin to work I'm releasing the code. Aldor
developers, as well as anyone else, are free to do anything with that
code including NOT making their changes available (per mBSD). I expect
to work closely with the Aldor group in the future.

Axiom code is 30 years worth of work by about 100 people and went thru
two companies (IBM and NAG). Both have been extremely generous in open
sourcing the code. The choice of modified BSD makes the code as free as
it can be.
