I am still struggling with the basics of Axion. 

E.g. I am trying to create formulae for products with, say, p sub k as 
symbols. These are the results from two, at least naively identical formulae:

(5) -> (1+p[1])*(1+p[2])

   (5)  (p  + 1)p  + p  + 1
          1      2    1
                                                     Type: Polynomial Integer
(6) -> product(1+p[k],k=1..2)

          2
   (6)  p   + 2p  + 1
         k      k
                                                     Type: Expression Integer

How could one use "product" (or "sum" for that reason) and an indexed way to 
denote variables?


Cheers, H.P.

Hello,

Perhaps you could try expressions such as :

(1) -> reduce(*,[eval(1+j, j=k) for k in [p[i] for i in 1..2]])

   (1)  (p  + 1)p  + p  + 1
          1      2    1
                                                     Type: Polynomial Integer
(2) -> reduce(+,[eval(1+j, j=k) for k in [p[i] for i in 1..2]])

   (2)  p  + p  + 2
         2    1
                                                     Type: Polynomial Integer

Sincerely,
Steve

Hans,

Perhaps the following pages on MathAction will be of some use
to you

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/UseProductAndSum
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/CreateIndexedVariables

Please let me know if what I have written is clear.

I would like to expand this HowTo section as new questions are
asked or better answers are created. If anyone feels like helping
with this task, it would of course be greatly appreciated.

Regards,
Bill Page.

PS. If you subscribe to MathAction (as a whole or to an individual
page), you will receive notices whenever a page is added or updated.
Right now, MathAction is set to send notices for all additions or
changes and this sometimes generates a lot of messages if someone
(like me :) makes a lot of small changes. The only alternative that
I know of right now is to set an option so that only new additions
(and not changes) are sent as notices. I would be interested in your
opinion about whether I should choose this less verbose alternative.

Too many for my taste.

I would prefer such a solution, but the current setting is tolerable.

I was just browsing http://page.axiom-developer.org/ and I'd like to make a few
suggestions -- apart from repeating that I find it just great!


* I like http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage a *lot*
  better than http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone

  I find it easier to read and use, better structured and
  simpler-looking. Since it seems that there are things on zope/Plone which are
  not on zope/mathaction, I suggest that you move those things worth moving to
  mathaction and make mathaction/FrontPage the principal page, which really
  should become axioms main homepage, I think.

  [This part I cannot do]

  In the same spirit, the links to the mailing lists and to savannah should be
  added to mathaction/FrontPage and the page should be tidied up a little.

  [I can do this, if somebody tells me: go ahead]

* The table of contents needs cleaning up. I suggest:

  - mathaction/AxiomAlgebra should contain (as subpage) the various layers as
    it does now

  [I can do this, if somebody tells me: go ahead]

  - each layer should contain the docs for the types it provides. (as layer0
    contains attreg and dhmatrix now)

  [I can do this, if somebody tells me: go ahead]

  - it would be great if these pages would be *identical* to the pamphlet
    files. It should be possible, shouldn't it? Maybe you could make a new
    style called "pamphlet", which produces LaTeX in the background using the
    "document" command and then applies "latex2html"? This way, we could move
    the complete src/algebra directory at once into the wiki!

    I believe that this would considerably speed up the transition to
    documented code!!!

  [This part I cannot do, but this would be number one priority]

Well, that should be enough for the moment.

thanks again,

Martin

I probably not understood everything but I think you need a second
translator to transform the edited html wiki into latex code, no?

Yes. And then an infrastructure to export that edited tree into an Arch
or similar CVS-like repository.

I'm personnally more interested to work on a Axiom browser which would
understand noweb markups and Common Lisp call tree but I haven't found
time yet to code my few ideas.

Yours,
d.

I agree, however from my point of view the Plone portal
environment plays a rather different role than the pure wiki
environment (MathAction) even though some of the functionality
of these two environments is the same. Some the differences
are purely technical design issues, some are historical and
some are more fundamental.

Plone (www.plone.org) originates from a web content management
development stream. The idea is to provide a way to maintain
a certain "corporate look and feel" but to allow the content
of a web site to be created and managed in a distributed
manner. Plone provides a number of different kind of "objects"
(only some of which are currently implemented in the Axiom
portal). Objects can be things like "file folders" that
contain other objects, then can be "documents" that display
as nicely formatted HTML pages, they can be structured things
like bibtex entries, events of news items that are linked by
time and date to a calendar, or they can be external files such
as PDF documents or binary files such as programs that need to
be downloaded to be accessed by the user.

Plone does this in a integrated and controlled manner that
enables "draft" content to be created by users and to be
"published" by a site manager etc. Objects in Plone have a
"state" that is related to the workflow associated with the
lifecycle of an object. Users of the portal have associated
"roles" and the combination of object state and user role
determines what can be done to/with each object. It even
allows a developer to create new object types to be created
and managed entirely through the web. Yes, this is a rather
complex environment.

*One* of the object types in Plone is a 'wiki page' that has
the same functionality as the pages that you see in MathAction.
This is where the main overlap between these two environment
exists. Unfortunately, technical limitations mean that it is
not possible for the actual content from one environment to
be directly accessed from the other.

The wiki web interface has a very different origin than content
management - considerably less 'structured'. In a wiki the
emphasis is on collaborative web page authoring. But many
wikis do not even require the authors to identify themselves.
Besides just "for the pleasure of communicating and sharing",
wikis have been used with at least moderate success for joint
distributed authoring of documentation.

The wiki that implements MathAction and that also provides
wiki objects in Plone is called ZWiki (www.zwiki.org). Both
Plone and ZWiki are implemented using the object-oriented
database and application development environment called Zope.
Besides Plone and ZWiki there are many other web applications
that have been built using Zope. Zope in turn is implemented
in Python. And oddly enough, the Python language bears a
great similarity to the Axiom programming language. ZWiki had
already been extended by Bob McElrath to include rendering of
LaTeX coding, so the extension of ZWiki to provide the Axiom
and Reduce interface was as they say "almost a match made in
heaven".

I am very glad that you are thinking about this. It is
possible (I think) to make the first page that you see in
Plone a wiki page. Then, besides all the other bells and
whistles provided by Plone, the initial interface between
these two systems would be the same. But there are many
things in the Plone that are not possible (or at least
awkward) in the pure wiki environment - for example, the
bibtex literature references and management of event
notices etc. What specifically would you like to have in
MathAction that is now currently only in Plone?

*If* we continue to maintain two different environments
like this, then I think the most natural progression would be
for some things to be developed *first* in the more open
and less structured MathAction wiki environment, and then
if they have a more lasting relevance, to move into the
Axiom Portal Plone environment for longer term access and
management.

Yes, I have very glad you are interested in this. I think
it has a lot of potential to make Axiom's algebra more
accessible to everyone. And also to make it possible to
cope with the complexity and get on with making improvements.
It seems to me that one thing that has happened to Axiom
(and some other computer math systems) is that it has reached
a kind of "plateau of development" that is constrained by
the available tools. Maybe (just maybe) this is one way to
move ahead.

Yes, I agree completely and I am actively working on this.
More details later and probably on the Axiom Portal itself.

You are welcome. And thank you for your contributions so
far.

I do not think there is any advantage in maintaining both a plone and
non-plone wiki.  It confuses users.  On the other hand, it should be
possible to copy or link wiki pages from one folder to another...and
present both interfaces for one set of pages.

In Plone there is often confusion as to where exactly users can write
latex, axiom, or reduce code (since there are so many document/object
types).  But Plone is more powerful, if users are organized by an
effective manager.

Keeping both interfaces might be useful, but they should not have the
same content.  Personally, I think a Plone site should be managed as a 
semi-professional face for Axiom.  A wiki can be maintained as a place
for users to "play", but should not contain official documentation.

As you know, moving documents from one to the other is trivial if
someone writes something great in the "play" area.

Of course it is possible to copy wiki pages from one folder
to another *within Plone* where folders appear as just another
type of object. But wiki users within a pure wiki environment
do not set folders, not even the Zope folders that appear at
the lower level of the Zope Management Interface.

And one can create links from and to the Plone to MathAction
the way I do now.

If you mean the stand alone (standard) ZWiki interface and the
Plone interface to ZWiki pages within Plone, then this does not
seem to be possible with the current version of ZWiki even when
both the ZWiki and Plone instances are hosted within the same
Zope instance. Have I missed something?

I agree and that is both the problem and the advantage of Plone.
To some degree I think that it just that Plone is a more
complex environment and users are not (yet) quite ready for
this more complex environment - they are just now getting used
to the idea of being able to edit web pages through a wiki.
Plone provides many features that probably don't seem relevant
(yet). I say (yet) because I think that perceptions and
expectation of users are likely to change as they gain experience
with this new environment.

This statement seems a little contradictory to your first paragraph.
Could you explain a little more.

Yes. That seems the right way to go to me.

But of course!  I'm just thinking out loud, not proposing a specific
site policy change.  But I think the current situation is confusing.

I'll leave the decisions to the people who are actually working on this
and not just spouting at the mouth, like me. ;)

No, it wouldn't. I propose the following: 

What you see in the form is the original pamphlet file.

Pressing "Save" (depending on the language, of course) invokes a modified
"document" command from the axiom distribution, which does not produce the spad
file and instead of invoking "latex", it invokes "latex2html".

The produced html is displayed, if there were no errors, otherwise you should
be thrown back to the edit form, and get the error messages displayed.

Of course, usually you would grab the pamphlet as a whole, modify it on your
local computer and than paste it back. Even better would be the possibility to
upload a complete pamphlet file.

Bill, you said you are working on this. Did you encounter problems? If you
manage to set it up today, I'd spend part of the weekend working on mathaction!

Martin

Hi people,

I have been reading Aldor recently, which I find very nice, and as a
first project I was happily planning to wrap up some numerical and
graphical code into aldor (since aldor lacks these),  but I was
recently pointed to axiom, and now have some questions:

1.  What is the extent of compatibility between aldor 1.0.2 as posted
in www.aldor.org and cvs axiom?  Does the current version of aldor
always generate code that runs in cvs version of axiom?  If not, maybe
it would be a good idea to post a page with the differences and things
to avoid.

2. If I use aldor's import and export keywords for wrapping C and
fortran code, will it be portable to axiom? Or does axiom have a
separate ffi?

3.  I know some C, f77 and Scilab but no Octave.  I see that one of the
to-do things is translating octave's numerical code into aldor; which
kind of routines are missing from aldor and have higher priority?

Maybe I can make my work compatible with axiom, bye bye,

Z.

I have not read the docs for quite some time, but the `authoritative'
account as given in the aldor compiler user guide at
www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap30.html (aldor.org seems to be down at
this time, so I am unable to verify that this is a proper link) gave a
recipe for interfacing Aldor and Axiom which did not work for
me. Undoubtedly things have changed since the guides writing. 

I am unsure as to when and if Aldor will officially support its former
role as a library compiler for Axiom, or when and if Axiom will
officially support Aldor. Perhaps someone else on this list could
comment on this.

However, I have managed to get Aldor and Axiom to cooperate on _very_
simple examples. I cannot give deep advice on as to why this works
since Axiom internals are still a mystery to me. However, this may
provide a means for you to experiment, and as such I hope it is
useful. 

The following might seem cryptic and not very clear. I apologize for this,
but time is not on my side at the moment. 

Consider the naive factorial function in Aldor:


 #include "axllib"

 fact(n: Integer): Integer == {
    n <= 1 => 1;
    res: Integer := 1;
    while n > 1 repeat {
	res := res * n;
	n := prev n;
    }
    res
 }


Say the above is in the file `fact.as'. If you invoke cvs Axiom from
within the same directory as `fact.as' and try to )compile it you may
very well get an error of the form:

 (1) -> )compile fact 
    Compiling AXIOM source code from file /home/steve/tmp/fact.as 
      using AXIOM-XL compiler and options 
 -O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y $AXIOM/algebra
        Use the system command )set compiler args to change these 
        options.
 
 >> System error:
 #p"/home/steve/local/opt/axiom/mnt/linux/compiler/bin/" is not of type STRING.

 protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)


I do not know how to compile Aldor files from Axiom, but note the
command line arguments given to the AXIOM-XL (now Aldor) compiler. In
particular note the command line argument `-Y $AXIOM/algebra' The sole
purpose of this is to provide a path to the library
`libaxiom.al'. This is contained in the Axiom source tree under
`axiom/src/share/algebra' but not installed with the system after a
build. Thus, try invoking Aldor as follows, assuming $AXIOMSRC points
to the top level of the Axiom _source_ tree:

   aldor -O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete \
	 -DAxiom -Y $AXIOMSRC/src/share/algebra fact.as

This should produce three files: fact.asy, fact.ao, and fact.lsp.

Now, within the Aldor distribution comes a file called `runtime.lsp'
under aldor/linux/1.0.2/lib/runtime.lsp. For me, the full path to this
file is /home/steve/local/opt/aldor/linux/1.0.2/lib/runtime.lsp.

I can now invoke Axiom where fact.as and friends were compiled and
say:

  (1) -> )library fact
     Reading /home/steve/tmp/fact.asy
  (1) -> )lisp (load "/home/steve/local/opt/aldor/linux/1.0.3/lib/runtime.lsp")

  Value = T
  (1) -> fact 4

     (1)  24
                                                        Type: PositiveInteger

I'm sorry, but I do not know the answer to this question. I suggest
experimenting with the technique above, though your mileage may vary.

I am unaware of the Octave -> Aldor translation. The principle Aldor
libraries I am familiar with are libaldor (the standard Aldor library)
and libalgebra (similar in some respects to Axioms mathematical
hierarchy). Both of these are very weak in terms of floating point
numerics. I know there is work underway to improve the
situation. Perhaps with a description of your work I can let you know
how it might fit in with current efforts.


I hope the above is useful to you. 

Cheers,
Steve

The Aldor support was designed to operate with the CCL version of Axiom,
not the new GCL one.  However Stephen Wilson's experiment seems to
suggest that it works fine :-)

The settings will assume that the compiler and the libraries that it
uses are in the same locations as was the case with the original NAG
version.  You can change these settings via ")set compiler" in the Axiom
interpreter.

The answers to these questions are "no" and "sort of".  Axiom per se has
no foreign language interface but the underlying Lisp often does (GCL
does for example).

I'm not sure whether its worth translating existing numerical code into
Aldor.  Fortran, particularly if your compiler has a good optimiser,
will always be much more efficient, and as you know you can access it in
Aldor via the Foreign Fortran interface.  However it might be an
interesting and useful exercise to consider how Axiom/Aldor's type
system could be used to provide a better interface to existing numerical
code.

Cheers, Mike.

I was planning interfaces to DISLIN and some of Netlib routines,
specifically numerical ODE, DAE and matrix routines.  I do not plan to
invent any new algorithm, but to rewrite or wrap enough to reproduce
some of Scilab features needed for optimal control.  My main motivation
for trying aldor was the lack of proper polynomials in scilab.

I think that this is the right way to go.  Unfortunately linking the
runtime probably reproduces unnecesarily a lot of the routines in
axiom.  You also loose aldor native compilation and speed.  On the
other hand you **theoretically** gain all of axiom functions: have you
tried adding a call to an axiom function to your program? For example,
how would you write in aldor a function to evaluate besselJ(1,1),
compile it using the above procedure and run it under axiom? Maybe this
is the nontrivial case.

Unfortunately I believe that aldor people have no interest in axiom
compatibility, mostly because of their ties with maple.  Also, I
remember having read at www.aldor.org that one of their goals or
projects was to rewrite the remaining axiom libraries in aldor.  So it
probably is up to axiom people to export or make available their system
to aldor users, if it proves of any use.


Z.

The Aldor runtime probably does mirror some of the Axiom mechanisms,
though from my understanding the worlds are quite separate, and from a
practical standpoint are mutually exclusive (If I'm wrong here I'm
sure I will be corrected). 

The only way I know how to measure the performance hit would be to
cook up some benchmarks and collect some statistics.

Well yes, you do have access to Axiom from Aldor via the Foreign Lisp
interface. Your right that it is the nontrivial case. I'll give a
short example as to how (your questions have rekindled my own
interest in figuring this sort of thing out).

If you have not already, perhaps you might like to read
axiom/src/doc/DeveloperNotes.dvi.

>From Axiom:

     (1) -> besselJ(1,1)
     besselJ(1,1)

     (1)  0.4400505857449335
                                                            Type: DoubleFloat
     (2) -> bess: (DFLOAT, DFLOAT) -> DFLOAT := besselJ
     bess: (DFLOAT, DFLOAT) -> DFLOAT := besselJ

     (1)  theMap(DFSFUN;besselJ;3Df;8,819)
                             Type: ((DoubleFloat,DoubleFloat) -> DoubleFloat)
     							    

theMap() above gives the Lisp name of the compiled besselJ function,
namely |DFSFUN;besselJ;3Df;8|. It is in the BOOT lisp package.

We can write the following aldor code:

   #include "axllib"

   import {
      BOOT_:_:DFSFUN_;besselJ_;3Df_;8: (DoubleFloat, DoubleFloat, Pointer) -> DoubleFloat;
   } from Foreign Lisp;


   wrapBessel(a: DoubleFloat, b: DoubleFloat): DoubleFloat == 
      BOOT_:_:DFSFUN_;besselJ_;3Df_;8(a, b, nil$Pointer);

If you compile and load this code as I described in the previous email
you can call `wrapBessel' from Axiom. 

Note that in calling |DFSFUN_;besselJ_;3Df_;8| from wrapBessel we are
supplying an extra argument which I rather arbitrarily defined as
having type Pointer. This is a hidden argument which all Axiom lisp
functions accept and is used, AFAIK, to pass a closure to the
function (i.e. `hidden' domain variables). How to use this extra
argument to good effect from Aldor is unknown to me. 

This is a messy but possibly necessary technique in getting the effect
you asked about.

There is definitely a relationship between Maple and the Aldor
folks. I am unaware of any current effort to rewrite the Axiom algebra
in Aldor. 

Aldor is a nice language, but the compiler is not as stable as one
might like. I am of the opinion that Axiom is a more mature piece of
software. As an open source system, I feel Axiom is likely to offer in
time all the features which give Aldor its raison d'etra, and more.


Again, I hope the above is useful to you. 


Sincerely,
Steve

So, i guess this is the kind of glue that axiom should provide for
aldor users in a "libaxiom.as".  Maybe it could be generated
automatically from axiom sources with same function names.

Yes, it has been very useful, thank you Steve.

I'm not in the office at the moment so can't cook up an example, but you
do not need to use the Foreign Lisp facilities to call Axiom from Aldor.
You need to do something like:

#include "axiom"

...

  import {besselJ (DoubleFloat, DoubleFloat) -> DoubleFloat; }
    from DoubleFloatSpecialFunctions;

...

The file libaxiom.al which makes all this work used to be built during
the Axiom build process.

By the way, its not true to say that the Aldor people are not interested
in Axiom because of their relationship with Maplesoft.  I know that some
of the people in that group still use Axiom - both the NAG and open
versions - with Aldor, since ( helped them with some benchmarking/code
optimisations a couple of months ago.  Its just that they have finite
resources and a mechanism for running Aldor code inside Maple fits in
with their current research interests (there are interesting problems
with having two collaborating garbage collectors operating on the same
objects for example) while resurrecting Axiom support doesn't.

Mike.

This makes a lot of sense.  But there is no libaxiom.al in the binary
installation of axiom (Debian).  There is a libaxiom.al in my copy of
axiom CVS sources though, but it is dated 2003-08-28.  Maybe
libaxiom.al is no longer built, or if this version is up to date then
it is not being installed with the binary distribution.  I will try
using this version tomorrow.

Thanks for your comment,

Z.

Dear Manuel, Marc, Ralf, *

recently I have started thinking about a common future of Aldor and
Axiom. I'm convinced that cooperation between the two will be necessary to
attract more scientists and users. Do you agree?

I think that the ultimates goals should be that

* Aldor becomes the extension language of Axiom, thus replacing Spad, and that
* as much as possible of the libraries are shared.

Do you agree that these are the "good" goals?

I have no idea at all how the first goal could be accomplished. Is it correct
that the current Aldor implementation within Axiom is a "proper" subset of
Aldor 1.0.2, i.e., that an Aldor program compiled with Axiom would have the
same semantics as the same program compiled with Aldor 1.0.2?

I had a short look at the documentation of the Algebra library of Aldor, so I
realize that the second goal will not be a quick and easy task either.

However, it seems to me that it is only the wealth of Spad libraries that make
Axiom interesting. Are the Axiom interpreter and the Aldor 1.0.2 interpreter
comparable? Can you tell me about the weaknesses and strenghts of the two
systems?

Martin

PS: is there an Aldor mailinglist? If you know someone who might be interested
in these issues, please forward this mail!

  Could you point a link that says so?  I have not found any on the
site you have given.  All I have found (on
<http://www.aldor.org/faqs.html> is "free of charge for non-commercial
use" which is not really a BSD license.

He probably means this:

http://www.aldor.org/downl.html 

The problem to me seems to be that parts of aldor are distributed ONLY
as binary files.  There is no source only distribution I am aware of,
and if I understand correctly the intent is that there not be one. 
That's why I've personally never viewed Aldor as a logical program to
use with Axiom.

How does one get the aldor source code? It is not downloadable from
the web site and there is no anonymous CVS available.

I suggest contacting those involved as specified here:

  http://www.aldor.org/contact.html

or by email at questions@aldor.org

Unfortunately at this time there is very little visible
connection between the Axiom and Aldor projects. I agree
with the general sentiment expressed by others here that
there *should be* a much stronger relationship.

Regards,
Bill Page.

You do realize of course, that not so long ago Aldor (then called
AxiomXL or the "library compiler") *was* a part of the commercial
version of Axiom? Aldor was "released" by NAG for non-commerical
development a few years before Axiom itself to a different group of
developers and under different conditions at a time when open source
was not so well developed as a concept.

Axiom can and does operate without Aldor but in principle Aldor
would provide better optimized library code and would compile
significantly faster than the compiler that is built-in to Axiom.
Since building Axiom and compiling all of the library code using
Axiom's compiler, on even a fast computer can take several hours,
I think using Aldor with Axiom could provide significant advantages -
especially during development and testing of new code.

There are a few people (and I am not one of them) who would have
to meet and agree on a common strategy, licensing, etc. before
Axiom and Aldor could become one again or at the very least
cooperate for mutual benefit. I think the best thing we could do
here is to demonstrate that there is an active interest in making
this happen.

BTW, I plan to have Aldor running in interactive move available
via MathAction in the next few days - though not linked to Axiom
(yet).

Regards,
Bill Page.

Look at http://www.aldor.org/faqs.html

How do I check out sources from CVS repository?

I said "BSD like license", not "BSD license". Furthermore I am not a la=

"like" may be wrong. Sorry.

My aldor compiler (1.0.2) complains about missing axiom.as. I looked in my
axiom sources and in the aldor installation, without success. There are cryptic
files axllib.as, aldor.as and so on in aldor/1.0.2/linux/include/ but axiom.as
is missing.

Mike, do you have it?

My aldor compiler (1.0.2) complains about missing axiom.as. I looked in my
axiom sources and in the aldor installation, without success. There are cryptic
files axllib.as, aldor.as and so on in aldor/1.0.2/linux/include/ but axiom.as
is missing.

Mike, do you have it?

Hi Martin,

Yes, as you can see its very simple.

Cheers, Mike.

Sorry, I just realised that they ask for a password to check out the
sources. Still, I strongly believe that Axiom and Aldor should coorporate,
since I guess that both communities are not especially big. (This concerns
mainly Axiom, I'm afraid)

Dear Mike, Tim, ...,

thanks for rapidly forwarding axiom.as.

Unfortunately, there are still some things missing. I first compiled

#include "axiom.as"

fact(n: PositiveInteger): PositiveInteger == {
    n <= 1 => 1;
    res: PositiveInteger := 1;
    while n > 1 repeat {
        res := res * n;
        n := n-1;
    }
    res
 }

and said

)lisp (load "/home/rubey/aldor/linux/1.0.2/lib/runtime.lsp")

then

)lib test

finally

fact 4

responded

Cannot open the file /home/rubey/axiom/mnt/linux/compiler/lib/axextend.o.

I found this file in the axiom distro and added it:

)lisp (load "/home/rubey/axiom/mnt/linux/compiler/lib/axextend.lsp")
)lib test
fact 4

24

Great.

However, I could not get to work the example given in
http://www.csd.uwo.ca/~watt/aldor/UserGuide/chap18.html#1

Axiom always responds with

   Caught fatal error [memory may be damaged]

I tried to include all the files from lsp/ccl/src/axbase/compiler/lib, without
success. I also noticed that the file runtime.lsp from there and from the aldor
distro differ, but I don't understand anything...

Would be great if somebody could get such an example to work.

Martin
