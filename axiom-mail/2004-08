Hi all,

I have written a package which calculates coefficients of a certain 
power series. It has a function which calculates the next coefficient, 
given all previous coefficient:

   nextCoeff: List K -> K

(here K is the coefficient domain).

How can I use this to create a lazy Stream of all the coefficients? I 
tried using delay, but cannot seem to get it right. (I am doing this 
inside a package.)

Marcus

The generate function from Stream should do this. See Section 5.6 of the Axiom
book (online-version: pg. 225, printed: pg. 132)

Hope this helps

Dear Axiom Users:

Yes, this is still the Axiom mailing list. But I wanted you to know that a
wiki-based interface for Reduce (similar to the one developed for Axiom) is
now available for testing on the Axiom developer system. See:

  http://page.axiom-developer.org

About Reduce:

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/reducewiki
 
Axiom and Reduce:

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/Members/billpage/TestReduce
 
GNUplot Graphics:

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/Members/billpage/ReduceTest1
 
Now you can access both Axiom and Reduce online - even on the same web page
if you wish!
This new feature is still in the testing stage, so it available only on the
test system. Some features may change as development progresses but please
feel free to try it and experiment (at your own risk of course! :)

It is important to report any problems you notice and if you have
suggestions for improvements or other comments about this work, I would be
delighted to hear them.

I am particularly interested in your views on the pros and cons of having a
"bilingual" online mathematics web site supporting both Axiom and Reduce.
Both Axiom and Reduce are similar in "age" -- or should I say maturity? Both
are now open source systems. But they differ significantly in their approach
to implementing mathematics on the computer.

BTW, a copy of Tim Daly's "Rosetta document" is available online. See:

A comparison of systems:

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/wiki/RosettaStone

Some of the information here is out of date and some is missing. If you are
able to contribute to the completion of the tables in this document your
collaboration will be most greatfully acknowledged. Note that since this is
a "wiki" page, you can edit it simply by logging in to the web site.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Axiom Users:

I know everyone hates to talk about "licenses" and such but
I think I need to make as brief as possible clarification
of what I wrote earlier.

On Wednesday, August 04, 2004 4:57 PM I wrote:

Tony Hearn has pointed out to me that what I wrote is not
correct. Reduce is not "open source". In fact the source
code of Reduce is available (for a fee). For ordering
information see:

  http://reduce-algebra.com/ordering%20information.htm

Licensing information is here:

  http://reduce.codemist.co.uk

and here

  http://www.zib.de/Symbolik/reduce/dist/

But Reduce *cannot* be redistributed to others without
permission from the original distributors. This is not
consistent with the strict definition of open source as
defined by www.opensource.org.

But in the same email Dr. Hearn confirmed that [my
paraphrase]: although one can not give anyone open access
to the Reduce source code, they can of course have free
use of the web interface.

This seems very clear to me and I have no problem continuing
to work with Reduce and Axiom on these terms.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear Axiom (and Reduce) Users:

I have installed the CMFBibliography package on the test
version of the Axiom portal web site. This package allows
you to enter or upload "bibtex" style literature references,
to search for these and to download bibtex format references
for inclusion in papers etc. See:

  http://test.axiom-developer.org/refs

I have loaded approximately 150 entries for Axiom from
Nelson Beebe's circa 2002 bibliography and over 900 entries
for Reduce from the Reduce web site (most of which were
also collected by Beebe). These references include papers
where a research made use of Axiom or Reduce for specific
applications.

You can search for references based on words from the
title, the authors, the abstract etc. For example, keying

  general relativity

into the Search box on the upper right produces a list of
16 references and 2 wiki pages.

These bibliographic entries are editable - if you are logged
in to the portal. Please feel free to update them if you have
new or more complete information about these entries. And
also to add new entries.

-------

You will also notice that it is now possible to set the
user language of the portal to English, French, German,
Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish. Support for
multiple languages is a feature of Plone. You can set the
language preferences in your browser and Plone will
automatically display your preferred language (if it is
available). Additional languages can be added later.
Please let me know if you have any trouble with this or
if you find seriously incorrect or missing translations.

There is another Plone feature called I18N which permits
one to store different language versions of selected web
pages and to serve these pages in the language of choice
of the user. I have not yet installed this feature on the
Axiom portal test system, but if there is some interest in
this I can do so quite easily.

As usual if you have some spare time, I would really
appreciate it if you could try out these new features and
give me some feedback - comments like: good, bad and
suggestions. If there are no major problems, this is will
be migrated to the main Axiom Portal web site later this
week.

Regards,
Bill Page.

The graphics work (src/graph) and the viewAlone program exists that
can view the graphics files that are created. The file format for 
2D graphics files is documented by the current build. The document is:

(path)/axiom/mnt/linux/doc/src/graph/fileformats.dvi

I have yet to document the 3D case. 

Also during the build a test file is created (from the 
src/graph/fileformats.pamphlet) in the (path)/axiom/int/graph directory.
You can see the 2D version of graphics working if you do:

cd (path)/axiom/int/graph
../../mnt/linux/bin/viewAlone parabola

This will bring up a 2D graph. If you click anywhere on the graph the
control panel will appear and you can manipulate the graph. Click on
the quit button twice to end the program.

There are two steps to do:

1. Integrate the graphics with the Axiom system
2. Document the 3D file format and source files
3. Build a 3D test case

Step 1 is in process. It requires recovering the sman program (aka
"superman"). I am in the process of building, documenting and testing
this locally but have not yet put it up on the worldwide server. Once
I complete step 1 I'll move on to steps 2 and 3.

At present I've stopped working on the sman program while I install
a series of long-overdue patches for the freebsd version (as you can
see from the flurry of patch confirmation messages). Once these
get locally tested I have to test them on Mark's freebsd system
so I can see how badly I've broken freebsd. When that completes
and is stable I'll return to building sman.

Tim

Mhhh... I have also a problem with graphics. As I'm very new to Axiom, I=20
did not want to ask any question before having tried many things... but..=
.

I Launch Axiom, and type a "draw" command:
:axiom
:draw(sin(x+y),x=3D0..1,y=3D0..1)

what I get is:
  ....
  Loading /usr/lib/axiom-0.20040705/algebra/VIEW3D.o for domain
      ThreeDimensionalViewport
   Transmitting data...
   Loading /usr/lib/axiom-0.20040705/algebra/COORDSYS.o for package
      CoordinateSystems
   Loading /usr/lib/axiom-0.20040705/algebra/PTPACK.o for package
      PointPackage

   (1)  ThreeDimensionalViewport: "sin y*y+x*x"
                                               Type:=20
ThreeDimensionalViewport


and no graphics at all... What should I do ?

My Axiom version whas shipped with Debian unstable on linux x86.

Yours,

Hello,

Great tool, great work!

I got axiom running of FreeBSD by integrating recent patches and doing

Hi

I'm new to Axiom. Is there some kind of comprehensive and searchable
documentation for what the various packages of Axiom do? The book in the
distribution only contains a little bit about some of the packages. I'm
thinking about a kind of "API documentation" in the style "this function
takes these parameters and does this and that".

More concretely, I want to implement a Groebner basis algorithm in Axiom
(The F4 algorithm of Faugere). However, I cannot find out how to make a
polynomial monic. What is the procedure to find out how to do something like
that?

Given the name of a package, how can I find the pamphlet file that contains
the code for that package?

Hmm, I use trial and error. And I'm lucky, since I've got the book by
Jenks/Sutor, and in the printed version there is a nice summary of many
commands. I don't really know why it's missing from the online version. (It
should be Appendix E...)

However, all the stuff which should be in Appendix E is in the source files,
roughly the comments following "++".

It often helps to look at the available commands of your domain using

)sh UP

for example. Also, if I'm looking for something, I try to imagine which
algorithms could use that something and read the source code there. That way, I
also found quite some bugs :-)

To make a polynomial monic, you can use divide by leadingCoefficient, of
course, but you probably knew that...

I use (at a unix command prompt)

grep ")abbr.* INT " *

since the information by asq is not correct at the moment.

Good luck,

Martin

Dear Axiom User:

I have just completed updating the axiom-developer.org
web site to include some of the new features that have
been under test: 1) You can now use both Axiom and Reduce
on these interactive web pages. 2) The Axiom portal
now includes an extensive bibliography of publications
on Axiom and on Reduce in the "References" section.

Click http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction
to access the MathAction wiki web site.

Click http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone
to access the Axiom/Reduce Portal.

Finally, you can also continue to help with testing and
the development at http://test.axiom-developer.org currently
I am workin on the multilingual user interface, noweb-style
"literate programming" features for creating wiki pages,
and generation of graphical output. 

Regards to all.

Bill Page.

Someone anonymously tried the following command on MathAction.
Is there any interest in a Maxima interface on MathAction? If
so, then I would be willing to work with someone how knows
Maxima to accomplish this. It should be quite easy.

Yes yes yes!

Maxima over Reduce, I say, as Maxima is free.  This kind of integration
and comparison will help to improve all.

I'm sorry I am extremely busy with physics projects right now, but I
still want to consolidate your work on external algebra systems.

Basically you've been copying my ReplaceInlineLatex.py and
latexWrapper.py for each new algebra system.  I would rather have one
ReplaceInline... which does regex matching and HTML stuff (there is much
code duplication currently) and dispatches to some kind of class which
just gets handed the code and returns html.

Also someday I plan to plug this all into the StructuredText class,
which will give it more rigor.  (Since zwiki and latexwiki are a pile of
regexps, it's not too hard to make all this fail)  I can identify
\begin{...}...\end{...} as a block in a StructuredText module, and hand
it off to a plugin to render...  See my StructuredTextLatex.py which is
a start in this direction.

But as you have been doing all the work on this, what I wan't doesn't
really matter, now does it!

Thanks for your work!

Bob,

Thanks for your comments about how to properly implement
the idea of "external algebra systems". Yes, I suppose
a lot of this could be made just "pluggable" but on the
other hand really the duplicated coding is quite short
and simple. At least based on the current sample of two,
it is dealing with the particulars of the target system
that takes up most of the code and I don't see how that
could really change. Fortunately Python's regexp features
are quite powerful and easy to use so in any case it is
only really 10 or 20 lines of specific code.

I would really support your idea to do this all in a
better way if the goal was to immediately support all
20 or so of the RosettaStone systems (such as we are
considering in Tim's "Doyen" project where actually the
number might be closer to 200 if we included all of the
Quantian tools). But that is really a different (: and
hopefully better funded/resourced than the current work :)
Right now I can only see this progressing in small
increments, so it is hard to find the time to "really
do it right"...

So, if/when you get the time and motivation to consolidate
this in the manner you suggest, then I would certainly
appreciate it.

So, back to the Maxima increment:

1) How does Maxima do LaTeX? What flavour TeX/LaTeX?
2) Can we run a command line interface the same way
we do in Axiom and Reduce that processes code in chunks
like this:

   > setup environment
   > read file1
   > read file2
   > read file3
   > ...
   > quit nicely

3) What kind of syntactical delimiters can we depend on
in the output file? For example both Axiom and Reduce
produce appropriate user input prompts which can be
used to separate and match the output chunks to input
chunks.

4) If someone can run Maxima in a "filter" mode like
this

  maxima <inputfile >outputfile

where the inputfile is structured like in 2) and
the chunks would be typical of what one might want
to put in between \begin{maxima} ... \end{maxima},
then I can take a look at the problem of parsing
the output.

5) Of course I *could* do all this again on my own, but
for my goals and purposes there are quickly diminishing
returns so I would prefer if someone else stepped up to
do Maxima and then someone stepped forward to do Yucas
etc. etc.

In fact I would say that with Axiom and Reduce, and the
Reduce interface to gnuplot, I have what I currently
need to do the things that I want personally to do with
this system - except I would really like to include Maple!
Because of damned licensing restrictions of non-free code,
though, maybe I will do that on my own personal "daughter"
system. Really I too just want to get back to simply
*using* this stuff for physics ... :(

Finally, about Reduce and licensing. Yes, it is "non-free".
Pity. But it is "almost free"... and I hope that we can
continue to put pressure on the current developers and
those marketing it, to fully release it as open source.
I have also repeatedly made the same argument to the Maple
developers. So far they do not "see the light" but they
have continued to move in the right direction.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

There are numerous existing problems with ZWiki and LatexWiki that I
know how to trigger with the right code.  In the long run we must move
away from regexes, but this is a long-term project.

Yeah, okay I will do it when I get time.  :)

Here is a little on that:

    http://www.hippasus.com/resources/symmath/maximatypeset.html

You can run the code straight, and then append code to typeset it like:
    tex(C1);
    tex(D1);
    tex(C2);
    tex(D2);
where Ci are the commands run and Di are the results generated from the
session.  Attached is a test file like this.

(C#) and (D#) denote input and output respectively where # is the line
number.

Note that maxima is free and in debian.  (love debian)  'apt-get install
maxima'.

This argument will likely continue for a long time.

But, when bugs are found, we can fix axiom, we cannot fix reduce.  So in
the end it is beneficial to the free systems that are incorporated, and
cannot be beneficial to the non-free systems.  (unless their developers
are paying attention to us)

(Clearly this reply is biased by the fact that I maintain Axiom but...)

Well, at least Reduce includes source code so all is not lost if the
team leaves the field. I worry about MMA or Maple.  It is fine with me
if they are commercial but I do worry about what would happen if they
disappeared. Macsyma fell off the face of the earth (although Schelter
rescued a DOE version). Axiom nearly did. Both were major commercial
systems.  I wish Wolfram and Maple would put their code in a dead
man's escrow so at least the work is not lost if the company folds.
How many companies can you name that are 100 years old?

This is a major concern regarding the 30 year horizon. The loss of
another commercial system, given the high concentration of effort,
would leave a smoking crater in the middle of computational
mathematics.

A lot of computational mathematics is invested in commercial efforts
and because these exist and are currently successful there is no
incentive to invest work in open systems. This seems unwise.
Mathematics may be eternal but programs, like bridges, need to be
maintained.

Tim

Bob,

In the example Maxima input and output that you sent
I do not see any way to distinguish a Maxima code
chunk containing multiple commands, e.g.

\begin{maxima}
FACTOR(x^2+2*x+1);
EXPAND(%);
\end{maxima}

from two separate chunks, like this.

\begin{maxima}
FACTOR(x^2+2*x+1);
\end{maxima}

\begin{maxima}
EXPAND(%);
\end{maxima}

It is necessary to ensure somehow that the output is
appropriately delimited. That is one of the benefits
of structuring the input file in the following way:

> setup environment
> read file1
> read file2
> read file3
> ...
> quit nicely

for both Axiom and Reduce. The other benefits have
to do with the way that these systems treat file-
oriented inputs in a non-interactive mode as opposed
the way they treat sysin. And it seems necessary
also for the case of compiling library modules etc.

Is there a way to do this with Maxima?

Bill.

I can't see a way to get maxima to read a file and echo the file and the
results.  You can just dump all commands to it at once though and then
get the output via the variables d1, d2...

hmmm but I don't know how to tell how many statements are in a given
block...

Bob,

This web site about 'imaxima'

  http://www.ifa.au.dk/~harder/imaxima-manual.html

seems to have some very relevant information to anyone
thinking about adding Maxima as a LatexWiki external
algebra system ... :)

Here is where I also learned about the TeX breqn (equation
line breaking) package for the first time.

> The single most ambitious goal of the breqn package,
> however, is to support automatic linebreaking of

Here are some comments pro and con

  http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2003/005539.html
  http://www.math.utexas.edu/pipermail/maxima/2003/005541.html

  etc. etc.

Note: We do this now for Axiom on the MathAction wiki using
the C language program written by Robert Sutor. The code for
this is now in the updated darcs repository at:

 http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository

Reduce has it's own system for doing this as part of the tex
package.

Still I find this native LaTeX package interesting and
possibly useful for LatexWiki as a whole.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I don't want to be pedantic but I have a high regard for Reduce - I used
it during my PhD and contributed a new version of the Gentran package -
and this criticism is not valid.  Reduce (at least the professional
version) comes with complete sources for all its mathematical content,
just as Axiom used to.  Its very easy for a user to patch their system
if they wish.

Cheers, Mike

But it is more difficult to get your changes into Reduce, and more
difficult for other users to receive those changes.  In the long-time
limit, free(er) systems will see more improvements than restricted
systems.

Anyway, this argument isn't productive so let's end it.  This is a
vi/emacs, linux/windows, binary kernel module/gpl kind of argument that
will go nowhere.

Reduce is here and we have permission, so let's do what we can with it.

Hear, hear!

To me one of the clearest strengths of the open model is the
demonstrable ability to maintain very long time horizons.  I could
never tabulate the productivity savings I've reaped from being able to
use the same editor/compiler/debugger as I did in grad school -- what
a return on one's initial investment in learning to use these tools!

Take care,

Chris,

"don't mind"??? Are you kidding? PLEASE try it. PLEASE,
PLEASE try it! Getting people to use or even think about
it this has been very difficult. I get reactions like:
Gee, that looks really good... They *might* try it once
and then nothing. I am at a bit of a loss to understand
this since I personally think that the collaborative
web interface is easy to use and should be very useful to
almost everyone.

Some days I think perhaps many people have some kind of
mental block against using the Web as an interactive
environment. Perhaps we are now so programmed to think
of the web browser as a one-way means of retrieving
information, that it is hard to conceive of using it for
two-way communication and as an interface to collaborative
programs. In fact, even without the LateX and Axiom interface,
I have had some trouble trying to convince people to use
the other wikis that I have implemented for other projects.
So I have started to wonder a little about the psychology
involved ...

I would be glad to tell you in detail how the LatexWiki
interface to Axiom and Reduce works. All of the code
is available in the online archive at

  http://page.axiom-developer.org

If you ask me questions about it, it will help me do
more of the documentation.

I would like to include Maxima along with Axiom and
Reduce, but I am not really familiar with Maxima and
am having a little trouble with the concept of executing
groups of commands (as opposed to one command at a time).

Can you give me a link to the work that you are doing
with Maxima?

Great. I think we need to exchange ideas and information.

Cheers,
Bill Page.
