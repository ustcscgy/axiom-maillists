To experiment with a little algorithm, I need to generate all subsets of a
set S which have fixed cardinality; for example to generate all three
element subsets of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7}.  Is there an inbuilt command to do this
in Axiom?  Or has somebody written a package to do such a thing?

Thanks,
Alasdair

Here is one possible solution using the subSet operation:

(1) -> subsets(s,n) == set [set map(i+->parts(s).(i+1),j) for j in [subSet(#s,n,
k) for k in 0..binomial(#s,n)-1]]
                                         Type: Void

(2) -> subsets(expand(1..7),3)
   Compiling function subsets with type (List Integer,PositiveInteger)
       -> Set Set Integer

   (2)
   {{1,2,3}, {1,2,4}, {1,3,4}, {2,3,4}, {1,2,5}, {1,3,5}, {2,3,5}, {1,4,5},
    {2,4,5}, {3,4,5}, {1,2,6}, {1,3,6}, {2,3,6}, {1,4,6}, {2,4,6}, {3,4,6},
    {1,5,6}, {2,5,6}, {3,5,6}, {4,5,6}, {1,2,7}, {1,3,7}, {2,3,7}, {1,4,7},
    {2,4,7}, {3,4,7}, {1,5,7}, {2,5,7}, {3,5,7}, {4,5,7}, {1,6,7}, {2,6,7},
    {3,6,7}, {4,6,7}, {5,6,7}}
                                      Type: Set Set Integer

Regards,
Bill Page.

Well, the species package of Ralf and myself does that, of course.  But I'm not
sure whether it wouldn't be overkill for your purpose.  Also, although you can
use it from axiom, you need the Aldor compiler to install it.

If you only need subsets, than

In Aldor you'd say something like

  structures(set [1,2,3,4,5,6,7])$(Combination(3)(Integer))

in Axiom you would have to create the domain Combination(3)(Integer) first
using

  C3==>Interpret([parse "Combination(3)"], ACINT)

since Axiom cannot deal with signatures like the above.  Furthermore, since
Axiom doesn't understand Aldor's extend, you'll have to create the list of your
labels as follows:

  l := set([1,2,3,4,5,6,7]::ACList INT)$SetSpecies ACINT

Now you can indeed say

  structures(l)$C3

and step through the subsets.

Otherwise, and especially if you only need subsets, I'd roll my own, just as
Bill did.  It depends a bit on how far you need to go.  If you google for
"Ruskey, combinatorial generation", you'll find RuskeyCombGen.pdf which
contains algorithms that are relatively easy to implement.

(In fact, Combination from the species project currently also uses a dumb
algorithm.)

If you are interested in the species approach, please do not hesitate to ask
for more explanations.

Martin

It turns out that subSet is a command from the package
SymmetricGroupCombinatoricFunctions (SGCF).  But there seems to be no
mention of it in HyperDoc.  Aside from this mail group, how would a user
find out about this function?

It turns out that subSet is a command from the package SymmetricGroupCombinatoricFunctions (SGCF).&nbsp; But there seems to be no mention of it in HyperDoc.&nbsp; Aside from this mail group, how would a user find out about this function?

Hmm, if I enter subSet in HyperDoc, I get it. What flavour of axiom are you
using?

Apart from that, the first thing to do is to say

  )wh th subset

(what things subset), which spits out a list of all things that have "subset"
in their name (case insensitive).  In fact, HyperDoc should be able to do this,
too, but I find ")wh th" easier to type.

Finally, the mailing lists are an excellent place to ask such questions.  Did
you have to wait long?

Martin

Well, Martin mentioned other ways to find it but I read about in the
way that is most common for me - by browsing Axiom source code on the
wiki:

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

by clicking:

   -> Browse Source -> src -> algebra

Then I entered the word

   subsets

in the search box on the top right and hit enter. There are 9 search
results and 'sgcf.spad' is near the bottom. Click on

 -> sgcf.spad -> pdf (or src, etc.)

to read the pamphlet files.

Of course if you have the source code files on your local system and
are used to using unix commands you can do almost the same thing in a
more primitive just by using grep:

  $ cd src/algebra
  $ grep 'subsets' *.pamphlet

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yes.

(1) -> )set message time on

(1) ->
                                                      Type: List List Integer

This works but obviously it should be possible to write an algorithm
that performs better than this ... :-( Sage can do it in less than a
second (via GAP) and apparently Mathematica can do it in about 0.04
seconds!

Bill Page.

As I said before (but maybe my message didn't get through), good algorithms are
described in Ruskey (google: "Ruskey, combinatorial generation", goto
RuskeyCombGen.pdf)

If you are indeed interested in such things, PLEASE consider joining the
species project.  Much work has already been done, and since Aldor is semi-free
now, I think it was not a wasted effort.  Note also that the framework provided
by the species project is very general - it becomes very easy to build new
structures from old.

We have some big problems, which we probably should be open about:

* apart from Ralf and myself, we have no users so far.  Well, we didn't
  advertise it either.  This is where you could help.

The other problems have to do with Aldor - Axiom internals.  I'll still mention
them here:

* Axiom does not support Aldor's extend construct.  I.e., one cannot say

  #include "axiom"
  extend Integer: LabelType == add ...

  which makes some ugly - user visible - workarounds necessary.  Enabling that
  would be wonderful.

* Axiom does not support general signatures like

  Combination(k: Integer)(L: LabelType): CombinatorialSpecies(L) with { ... }

  Again, we provide a workaround.  I expect a real fix to be rather hard, here.

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted to sci.math.symbolic,gnu.emacs.sources as well.

I just uploaded another improved version of my emacs mode.  The most important
new features - apart from bugfixes and cleanups - are:

* you can now have several axiom sessions in parallel within one emacs, as
  things should be.  Say M-x axiom to start a session, M-x rename-uniquely to
  rename it, M-x axiom to start a second one.

* I used axiom's history mechanism to support saving and restoring worksheets
  now.  M-x s asks you for a file name, supply one and emacs will store
  everything:

  -  myfile.input         ... the lines of input you typed
  -  myfile               ... the buffer as it looks
  -  myfile.axh/index.KAF ... the state of the axiom session

  Visiting myfile, and typing M-x axiom-mode will restore the state of the
  axiom session and display the buffer as it looked before.  I yet need to use
  enriched mode, and somehow store the overlays as well, or make them into
  text-properties, but that shouldn't be too difficult.

Get it from

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomEmacsMode

I'd be very happy to hear whether you find it useful in general, and
suggestions on how to improve it.  Since I don't own MS Windows, I'd be
especially grateful for testing on MS Windows.  An xemacs port would also be
greatly appreciated.

Martin

Sorry for spamming, I just uploaded todays work and I believe it's worth
another mail.

So, 

* goto http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomEmacsMode

* click on tangle

* put the resulting file in a directory where gnu emacs can find it, most
  likely ~/emacs

* edit your .emacs to contain the following two lines:

(setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.axiom$" . axiom-mode) auto-mode-alist))
(require 'axiom)

* start emacs

* issue M-x axiom RET (for non-emacs users: press the alt key and "x", then
  enter "axiom", then hit return)

* do some computations

* try to kill the buffer (for non-emacs users: press the ctrl key and "k")
  but then answer with "no"

* save your file (for non-emacs users: press the ctrl key and "x", then "s")
  and choose a file name ending in ".axiom".

* kill the buffer (for non-emacs users: press the ctrl key and "k")

* visit the file (for non-emacs users: press the ctrl key and "x", then "f", 
  then the filename including ".axiom", then return)

* enjoy.

Send bugs to any of the lists, or to myself.

Martin

That would be truly wonderful.  If there is anything we could do to support
you, please don't hesitate to ask.

But now I have to ask: what is the primary goal for you?  :-)

Now that the aldor source has turned up (thanks stephen, and apologies for 
missing the august  get together), I'm having another go at getting this 
going (although I have to admit it's not really a primary goal for me)..  I 
might have something together in a few weeks with a following wind.

Getting axiom to play nice with aldor is the starting point, then there's a 
few compiler things that I would like to play with - axiom extend will be 
good to have, but may involve more axiom hacking than I have the patience 
for.

Having the interop stuff in at least one of the various axioms that are 
floating around is also on the list.

I have been using Axiom (and also Maxima) this semester for a class in
cryptography.  This subject covers public-key cryptography (RSA, Rabin, El
Gamal) and signature schemes, secret key cryptography (in particular DES an=
d
AES), hash functions, and all the necessary mathematics - mainly number
theory and finite fields.  The students who have chosen Axiom have taken
well to it.

If anyone wants to see how I've managed this subject, go to
http://suzuki.vu.edu.au/moodle2, and login as a guest to the subject
RCM3720/6812, using the login key "C1PHER". (The second character is the
numeral "one").

The subject only has two more weeks to run, but if you are interested, the
lectures are broadcast from our Access Grid Room - you can watch me in real
time if you have the requisite software (which is free).

cheers,
Alasdair

(suzuki) doesn't seem to have a world-visible IP address.
I can get to vu.edu.au but I cannot find the course listed.

I can obtain a hexadecimal number, for example 1000::RadixExpansion(16)
which produces "3E8"..  But how do I enter a hexadecimal number in Axiom?
How do I enter DB6A, for example, and have Axiom recognize it as a
hexadecimal number?

Thanks,
Alasdair

I am not entirely sure what you mean by "hexadecimal number". If you
mean the domain RadixExpansion(16) then perhaps this is not what you
want. But here is one way of converting a string of hexdecimal digits
representing a number to an integer that takes advantage of the Lisp
functionality that underlies Axiom:

(1) -> hex(x:String):Integer == integer(READ_-FROM_-STRING("#16r".x)$Lisp)
   Function declaration hex : String -> Integer has been added to
      workspace.
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> hex("DB6A")
   Compiling function hex with type String -> Integer

   (2)  56170
                                                        Type: PositiveInteger

--------

Maybe that could be of some help.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Here it is:

F:=FFP(PF 2,x^3+x+1)
x:=generator()$F
for i in 0..7 repeat print [i,x^i]

   [0,1]
   [1,%D]
        2
   [0,%D ]
   [1,%D + 1]
        2
   [0,%D  + %D]
        2
   [1,%D  + %D + 1]
        2
   [0,%D  + 1]
   [1,1]

Note that because of the PF 2, the values of i in the lists to be printed
are automatically reduced mod 2.  But this is not what I want - I want the
printed values of i to range from 0 to 7.   How can I do this, given that
print only takes one argument?

Thanks,
Alasdair

The "problem" is not print, but rather that the simplest signature for the
constructor function in [i, x^i] the interpreter can find takes some F's and
returns a List F.  Above I explicitly told the interpreter to use the
constructor function that takes Union(INT, F)'s and returns a list of such
elements. Compare with

for i in 0..7 repeat print([i, x^i]::List Union(INT, F))

Ooops. Anybody else experiencing this?
Clearly, I gave wrong input first, but the error message is frightening.

(I am not sure which revision I used when I built OA.)

Try this:

(9) -> for i in 0..7 repeat output(i::String,x^i)
   0 1
   1 %A
       2
   2 %A
   3 %A + 1
       2
   4 %A  + %A
       2
   5 %A  + %A + 1
       2
   6 %A  + 1
   7 1

Yesterday I was looking for a cartesian product, INT x F
Today Alasdair is looking for a cartesian product.

Cartesian products are very common in mathmeatics 
and axiom seems to have no natural way to work arround this notion.

Hm, at least what you asked on the list is a little different from what
Alasdair needed:

you wanted all elements in [0..9]^4, Alasdair needed a way to bundle two
elements of two different types.

I should maybe mention that what you need is trivial to do with Ralf's and my
species package.

For Alasdair, not even that's necessary.  What would be nice would be Cross as
in Aldor.  Well, in fact, it would be nice to have Aldor replace SPAD...

Although it would be nice to have Aldor replace SPAD (as a language), 
why don't you use Record as a workaround? You can easily produce your 
own domain that models

   Integer x F

Record(i: Integer, f: F)

would be the right thing.

Actually (at least in Aldor) that cannot be printed, but to go around 
this, simply wrap this Record with a definition of a new domain, that 
has the property "CoercibleTo(OutputForm)" and implement that coerce nicely.

Of course, that is some work, but "Cross" wouldn't help here anyway.

Ralf

I just started using Axiom recently and have obtained very useful 
numerical solutions of a set of equations. I am now trying to embed 
the solve in a loop so I can easily try different parameter values, 
and I can't get it to work within the loop.

Appended below is a simple test. The solve within the loop is just 
silently skipped over, while the solve outside the loop gives me the 
expected result. Am I doing something silly? Or, rather, what am I 
doing that is silly?

(The comment lines marked bad1 and bad2 are attempts to make the loop 
more elegant. They don't work, but that's another story.)

Test case

eq1 == p^2 + 2*P + 5 = 0; precision := 1.e-6;
plist == [1000,2000,3000]

--bad1 for ip in 1..3 repeat
--bad1   p == plist.ip
--bad2 for p in plist repeat

-- for some reason the solves don't get executed
ip := 0;
for ipp in 1..3 repeat
   ip := ip + 1;
   p == plist.ip;
   output("p=",p);
   solve(eq1,precision)

-- the following solve does get executed
output("p=",p)
solve(eq1,precision)

Hello Robert,

You need an output operation like this:

 for ipp in 1..3 repeat
    ip := ip + 1
    p == plist.ip
    output("p=",p)
    output solve(eq1,precision)

OAxiom treats the enter for-loop as a single expression and only
outputs the value returned by the last statement executed. The rest
are thrown away unles you do something with them - like explicitly ask
for the 'output'.

Of course there are a lot of different ways to write this sort of
loop. I would probably do it something like this:

  )clear all
  )set message autoload off

  eq1 := p^2 + 2*P + 5 = 0
  precision := 1.e-6
  plist := [1000,2000,3000]

  for i in plist repeat
    output("p=".(i::String), solve(eval(eq1,p=i),precision).1)

---------

Normally == is only used in the Axiom interpreter for defining functions.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill -

Thanks! I'll try that tomorrow. I had read that everything but the 
last thing in the loop would be thrown away, but since the solve is 
the last thing in the loop, I thought I'd see its results. Why do I 
need an output for the solve in the loop when I don't need it for the 
one outside the loop?

Is there a simple explanation for why you need to do 'for i in plist'
then p=i rather than just 'for p in plist'?

- Robert

Contrary to what I implied in my previous email, apparently Axiom's
for loop is defined to return only a "Void" result. In contrast a
sequence of statements does behave as you say so that for example the
value of 'x' after the execution of:

  x:=(1;2;3)

is 3.

The reason has to do with the scope of the variable inside the
for-loop. It is a different 'p' then the one that you used when you
defined the equation. You could write however:

  for p in [1000,2000,3000] repeat output solve(p^2 + 2*P + 5 = 0, 1.e-6)

now with p occuring inside the loop.

Alternatively you might pass p to a function that defines the equation
you want to solve:

  eq1(p) == p^2 + 2*P + 5 = 0
  for p in [1000,2000,3000] repeat output solve(eq1(p), 1.e-6)

Regards,
Bill Page.

That's correct.  Furthermore, that's also the behaviour of aldor.

There is another thing:

    p == plist.ip;

defines p to be a (nullary) function.  You probably meant to say

    p := plist.ip;

It seems that 'output' can be used in the form 'output(...)' or 
'output ...'. For example, 'output(i)' but 'output [x,y]' in the Axiom 
book. What is the difference and where is this actually documented?
I've hunted in HyperDoc, in the Axiom book and in Martin Dunstan's 
tutorial without success.

(I'm still working on digesting the responses to my previous 
questions.)

Robert,

In Axiom there is no need to add extra parenthesis. So both

   sin 1.0

and

  sin(1.0)

mean exactly the same thing. The only time parenthesis are needed is
if there is any ambiguity.

There is nothing special about 'output'. It is just another operation
like all other operations in Axiom. So

  output 1

and

  output(1)

mean exactly the same thing. But if you call 'output' with two
arguments, then you must enclose the argument list in parenthesis like
this:

  output ("test",1)

so that Axiom knows you intend to apply 'output' to both arguments.

(space before the '(' is optional)

'output [x,y]'  is a slightly different case. Here you are asking
Axiom to first form a List '[x,y]' which forms a single value and then
the 'output' operator is applied to that value.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Ah! Very clear. Thanks.

Is this explained somewhere that I should have found?

And is the output operator itself documented somewhere? Not that I 
really need it, but I have a feeling that I'm missing something.

Oooh. Red face.
As embarrassing as it is, I'll explain why I hadn't found that, in 
case there is someone else with the same affliction.

When I run axiom, the HyperDoc window pops up and says 'AXIOM HyperDoc 
Top Level'. I click on, say, Reference to look for something. A second 
window pops up on top of the first window. I poke around for a while, 
using the home and/or up-arrow buttons to get back to the top. At the 
top I see 'Axiom Reference' and no home or up-arrow button, and as a 
very confused newbie forget that there's another window hiding behind 
this one. (I had actually came across a reference to Browse at one 
point and couldn't figure out why I couldn't find it, but then forgot 
about it.)

The lack of a home or up-arrow button at the top level of a 
second-level item like Reference or Browse is a result of wanting 
those things to open in separate windows. Would it be reasonable or 
feasible to have those second-level windows open with offsets from the 
parent Top Level window?

Thanks!  Yes, HyperDoc's behaviour is a little "unusual" given todays
standards.  Unfortunately, it seems that it's not really trivial to modify.
I'd still advise you to use it, since it is a great source of information.
Note that various flavours of axiom provide versions of HyperDoc to different
degrees of robustness.  Thus, if your HyperDoc crashes, ask again.

There is one other command I use frequently, namely, if I do not know at all
where I should be looking:

    )what things somethingiamlookingfor

or, shorther

    )wh th somethingiamlookingfor

(in the axiom console, that is)

It does a case-insensitive search for all operations / domains / packages /
categories for somethingiamlookingfor.  Thus, if I forgot how to spell the
binomial coefficient (LaTeX likes binom, mathematica Binomial, ...) I just ask

    )wh th bino

or so.

If you are interested in how things are actually programmed, maybe you like to
install 

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SPADEDIT

(click on "tangle" and save the result in

/axiom/target/i686-pc-linux/lib/SPADEDIT

(on some flavours of axiom, the path may look a little different, but I forgot
the details.  I think you'd have to replace target/i686-pc-linux with
mnt/linux)

Then you have to adapt it to your needs, i.e., replace

    gnuclient

with the name of your editor of choice.

($number contains the line-number to jump to.)

Finally make it executable.  Then, in HyperDoc

    click browse - enter INT - click constructors - click INT.spad

should open the source file at the right place.

Thanks for the additional information. I'll try the SPADEDIT thing 
when I'm feeling particularly masochistic :-)

My HyperDoc does crash if I try to search the library documentation in 
the Browser. It says
     Cannot open the file /usr/lib/axiom-20050901/algebra/libdb.text.
and kills not only the Browser window but also the top-level HyperDoc 
window. I don't know why that file is missing. I'm using the version 
of Axiom in Debian Etch.

Another surprising behaviour is that if I kill one of the secondary 
windows using the operating system's (GNOME's) close-window command, 
the top-level HyperDoc window also dies. Sometimes this also seems to 
cause the main Axiom command line to stop acting properly, such that I 
can give a )quit command but it doesn't quit, so I have to kill the 
Axiom process from outside. I can't seem to replicate it right now.

In spite of all this whining, I'm very happy: thanks to the great help 
from you and Bill Page, I have managed to write some Axiom code to 
solve my problem, with 4 levels of nested loops to do parameter 
variations, and a bunch of if-then-else's! I even figured out how to 
select the right one of the 3 solutions to the cubic (defined with 4 
equations in 4 unknowns) and squirt all the results into a TeXmacs 
document :-)

Thank you.

- Robert

As a follow-up for anyone who happens to see this thread later: 
installing FriCAS as explained by Martin Rubey in a separate thread 
today does indeed fix my problem with searching the library 
documentation.

The killing of all HyperDoc windows by closing any one of them (with 
the window manager's Close command) still happens.
