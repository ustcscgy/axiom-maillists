Hi all,

I got stuck trying to write a spad function that will take an argument 
of a certain type T, construct from this some other type S, and return 
an object of type S. I am using the "Any" type to do this, but I have a 
problem extracting and using the type and object encapsulated in the Any 
object.

Here is a simplified example (yes, Laurent series again!): The function 
f takes a univariate Laurent series over the domain K, performs some 
calculation, constructs a domain L which is a SimpleAlgebraicExtension 
of K (whose defining equation depends on the computed values). The 
function then returns some other Laurent series over L.

This is some sample code. (It is not tested, I just removed the 
irrelevant parts of my code.)

----------------------------------------------------------------
)abbrev package FOO Foo
Foo(K: CommutativeRing, ULS: UnivariateLaurentSeriesCategory K):
   Exports == Implementation where

   Exports ==> with
     f: ULS -> Any

   Implementation ==>
     f(x) ==
       -- Compute some equation over K.
       eq := monomial(1,2)$SUP(K) _
             - monomial(first coefficients taylorRep x, 0)$SUP(K)

       -- Create an extension L of K.
       L := SimpleAlgebraicExtension(K, SUP K, eq)

       -- Create and return a new Laurent series over L.
       -- The 'zero' variable is necessary due to a compiler bug...
       zero := 0::L
       TS := UnivariateTaylorSeries(L,z,zero)
       LS := UnivariateLaurentSeries(L,z,zero)
       y := map(#1::L, coefficients taylorRep x)$StreamFunctions2(K,L)
       coerce(laurent(-2, series(y)$TS)$LS)$AnyFunctions1(LS)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, how can the caller of f retrieve the domain L and, say, extract the 
first coefficient of the returned series y?

Regards,

Marcus

PS. Please CC me with any replies, I am not subscribed to the mailing lists.

City College is having an Axiom conference to introduce the world
to users of Axiom. If you're using it in any area of science we'd
like to hear from you. The conference is a 1 day event on April 22
in NYC. Some funding is available so if you'd like to visit NYC in
the spring this is the time to suggest a presentation.

Send email to daly@idsi.net.

Axiom *,

Something that probably should have been obvious caught me
by surprize today.

I have been working Axiom developer system configurations
for so long now that I had forgotten to make a distinction
between the types of users and the software that they need
to install. This is especially obvious on Windows because,
unlike linux, Windows is very often configured without
any development tools whatever. Only end-users application
programs might installed and even then these can often be
restricted to support an even more limited set of functions
for certain users. That is really what this message is
about. But first let me tell you the story...

*[This is Microsoft's World and while working intensively
with open source and linux we might sometimes forget what
it is like for the other 90% of the world ... :]*


Users, Programmers and Developers

  Anyway, this afternoon I installed Axiom for Windows

http://page.axiom-developer.org/axiom-windows-0.1.3.exe

on an entirely new machine with *no* other software installed
except the basic operating system (Windows 2000). Now that
we know about the problem of paths with spaces, I also opted
to override the default and install Axiom into the directory::

  c:\axiom

instead of::

  c:\Program Files\axiom

which is the default.

Then I proceeded to test Axiom in the usual way by running
a few selected input files. Everything seemed fine.

Finally since we have been talking about compiling spad
files today, I also tried to compile a src/algebra file.
I was very surprized when Axiom when all the way through
the spad compile and then told me (well GCL told me, really)
that it could not find `gcc'!

Then after I thought about it for a while I realized that
GCL really does depend on gcc and that gcc is *not* included
in the version of GCL that is installed with the Axiom
build. Well, of course not, right? <embarrassment> For
over more than a month now, a total of nearly 1,000 users
have downloaded the pre-release versions of axiom-windows
and it did not occur to me that they would not be able to
compile a spad file! sheesh. That seemed so odd to me since
I have been doing exactly that several times a day over
that same time, experimenting and testing new versions.
But then, I *do* have the full developer environment
installed.

So, who are all these people who are apparently quite
satisfied playing with and using this version of Axiom
that only includes about 1/2 of what Axiom can do?
Well, *Axiom Users* I guess. But certainly not Axiom
Programmers in the natural sense of the word because
they (probably) don't even have the pieces installed
that they would need to compile a program. An Axiom
end User then is someone who is satisfied with just
the contents of the mnt directory. They can do all
the calculations that Axiom is pre-programmed to do
and they can even define long calculations including
function definitions and the kind of program control
that can be written in input files, but then can *not*
compile new library files.

What besides the contents of the mnt directory is
required before one can compile library files? Well,
just the C compiler, of course. On windows the
minimum additional software that has to be installed
is called MinGW ( http://www.mingw.org/ ) and consists
of the "mingw-runtime, w32api, binutils and gcc tarball
packages" from ( http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml ):

http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/mingw-runtime-3.5.tar.gz?download

http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/w32api-3.2.tar.gz?download

http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/binutils-2.15.91-20040904-1.tar.gz?download

http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/gcc-core-3.4.2-20040916-1.tar.gz?download

You need to download each of these files and unzip them
(using a Windows shareware (evaluation version) program
like WinZip http://www.winzip.com/ http://www.7-zip.org/
or other free equivalent will do) directly into the::

  mnt/windows

directory, the root of your Axiom installation. This is
the most convenient place because the Axiom installation
has already added this location to the path that allows
your system to find and execute this programs.

FINALLY, there is one more thing that you need add. One of
the unix compatibility programs called rm.exe is missing
from::

  mnt/windows/bin

Click on

http://page.axiom-developer.org/rm.exe

and choose "Save As". Locate the `mnt\windows\bin'
directory and click Save.

Now at last you have a Windows Axiom Programmer's system
configuration. You will be able to create, modify and
compile spad files to create your own customized mathematical
library.

When you create .spad files, be sure to save them in
path that does not include spaces. This means that you
can not use `My Documents' which is (more or less) the
Windows default location. If you like, you can create
a directory called `local' within your Axiom base
installation directory. For example::

  c:\test\local

Save your files there. In Axiom you should change the
default directory to `local' so that you can easily
compile files like this::

  )cd ../..
  )cd local
  )co yourfile.spad

and::

  )library yourfile.spad

to load a file compiled during a previous session.

**Enjoy!**

In the next pre-release of Axiom for Windows I think it
would be a good idea if we provided at least the above
end User's and the larger Programmer's configurations in
two complete downloads and self-install files. I have
checked the licenses for MinGW and I am quite sure that
including the run-time and minimal compiler programs in
the Axiom install is allowed by the developers. It is
however very clearly a GPL license.

In fact, you should expect that over the next few months
many aspects of the Axiom installation will become easier
and more complete. Stay tuned to the MathAction website:

http://page.axiom-developer.org

or this email list for more up to date information!

---------

Lastly, I will define Axiom Developers as those masochists
who are willing to spend their time configuring and testing
new complete releases of Axiom for others. The development
environment of this on Windows is everything the Programmers
have plus the MSYS developer's tools. See
( http://www.mingw.org/msys.shtml ) for the following files:

http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/MSYS-1.0.8.exe?download

http://prdownloads.sf.net/mingw/msysDTK-1.0.1.exe?download

Download these self-install files and then run them to
create a programming environment under windows that is
in many ways like linux (however, more minimal :). When
you install these programs, make sure to specify that you
also have MingGW installed.

And one last thing. Before you can run::

  .\configure
  make

You should also have the tla arch program installed so
that you can download the Axiom source files and you will
be able to upload your patches and new features. To get
tla click

http://download.sipsolutions.de/tla-setup.exe

Download and run this program to install tla. Once this is
installed, you will be able to run tla from inside MSYS or
from tla's own special command line shell. The rest of
the instructions for developers is as

http://arch.axiom-developer.org

--------

As usual, this is the right place to ask quesitions. We
have a large and growing number of people who will be
happy to answer your questions.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Axiom *

I forget one thing when I described the additional programs
that are needed to support Axiom programming under Windows.
Axiom Programmers should (optional for Axiom Users and
mandatory for Axiom Developers) also install support for
LaTeX. Of course it is essential that developers, programmers
and even Axiom users devote as much effort as possible to
preparing accurate and easy to read documentation, otherwise
a great deal of effort and intellectual investment in can
be quickly lost.

Axiom Users can also optionally use TeXmacs

http://www.texmacs.org

to interact with Axiom and to prepare high quality mathematical
documents.

The standard form for all Axiom programs and documentation is
the noweb extension of LaTeX (called "pamphlet files" in Axiom
terminology). Pamphlet files contain both documentation and the
program code itself. This format is used for all internal Axiom
coding and the entire Algebra library. It is expected that new
Algebra that is intended by it's author to be shared with other
Axiom users will also be prepared in pamphlet format.

Unfortunately pamphlet format is not (yet) fully supported by
TeXmacs.

There are several Windows compatible versions of LaTeX to choose
from. The one that I have used very successfully is MikTeX
( http://www.miktex.org/ ). To install MikTeX click

http://www.miktex.org/setup.html

and follow the instructions. If your computer is connected to
the Internet then the "small" version (small-miktex-2.4.1705.exe)
will be sufficient for use with Axiom.

For Windows users who have no previous experience with LaTeX
(and even if you do) I would also recommend that you install
a good LaTeX-aware text editor. See

http://www.miktex.org/links.html

One of the easiest to use and completely open source is
TeXnicCenter

http://www.toolscenter.org/front_content.php?idcat=26

Click 'download' and select "TeXnicCenter Setup, Version 1
beta ...". This is a self-installing file. If you install
TeXnicCenter after MikTeX, it will be automatically configured
to support MikTeX.

TeXnicCenter is very easy to use for LaTeX beginners and
it is will supported by it's developers and the users group.
It is also quite easily configured to support LaTeX extensions
such as noweb.

Regards,
Bill Page.

The Windows maxima binary package, also built with gcl, includes
gcc.exe, cc1.exe, as.exe and the few header files required. =20
I can provide more details if needed. =20

So this would be the minimum list of files that are needed by
GCL in order to do a compile and where to put them? Yes, please.

I would also prefer to include these files in the Axiom
installation program so that no other software installations
are required by the user to get a fully functional system.

Thanks.

Bill Page.

This is the setup for maxima-5.9.1, using gcc-3.3.1.  There will be
slight variation for other versions of gcc.

First we need to put gcc.exe somewhere in the path.  I think that
the logical place is axiom/mnt/windows/bin. =20

The other files are located relative to gcc.exe

Hello,

I just installed Axiom on my computer (readhat 7.3) and tried to produce a 

draw(sin(x),x=-3.14..3.14)

but no plot is produced. Instead I get:
   Compiling function %N with type DoubleFloat -> DoubleFloat
   Graph data being transmitted to the viewport manager...
   AXIOM2D data being transmitted to the viewport manager...

Has anybody an idea? Do I have to install another package?

thanks

br

Bertrand,

The version you have does not have the graphics integrated into the 
'axiom' command. That will happen with the February 2005 release.

In order to see the graphics you need to start the system with the
sman command. The sman (superman) process sits above the axiom 
interpreter and uses sockets to communicate between axiom and the
graphics program. So sman needs to start first and automatically
starts axiom.

You should be able to start axiom by typing:

sman

(which will give a lot of debugging output. you can also use

sman 2>/dev/null

either command will start axiom. Then you can type

draw(sin(x),x=-10..10)                  for 2D output
draw(sin(x*y),x=-10..10,y=-10..10)      for 3D output


The full integration was not complete by the January 2005 version.

Tim

I would like to try and build axiom under windows/mingw. I already know =
how to:
 - compile gcl-2.6.5 and gcl-2.6.6pre (from CVS)
 - compile, test and package maxima
 - compile and test ACL2

Can someone point me to the latest set of instructions.  I have googled =
around and am quite confused.

David, maybe this web page will help. Where it doesn't,
please ask questions and we (you and I) can update it:

David,

Based on the file list that you see me earlier, here is a list
of MinGW gcc files that I have included in the most recent
Axiom for Windows:

In ...\mnt\windows\

	bin\gcc.exe
	bin\as.exe
	libexec\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\cc1.exe
	lib\gcc\
	lib\gcc\mingw32\
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\emmintrin.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\float.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\gmp.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\iso646.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\limits.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\mmintrin.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\pmmintrin.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\stdarg.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\stdbool.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\stddef.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\syslimits.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\unwind.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\varargs.h
	lib\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2\include\xmmintrin.h
	lib\gcc-lib\
	lib\gcc-lib\specs
	include\
	include\_mingw.h
	include\getopt.h
	include\io.h
	include\math.h
	include\process.h
	include\setjmp.h
	include\stddef.h
	include\stdio.h
	include\stdlib.h
	include\unistd.h
	include\varargs.h
	include\sys\
	include\sys\fcntl.h
	include\sys\file.h
	include\sys\locking.h
	include\sys\param.h
	include\sys\stat.h
	include\sys\time.h
	include\sys\timeb.h
	include\sys\types.h
	include\sys\unistd.h
	include\sys\utime.h

All files come from `C:\MinGW\' of the standard MinGW
installation. As you said it has a slightly different
layout compared to the earlier version. This list seems
sufficient to compile Axiom spad libary programs. I am
not sure whether it can be paired down any more.

See the download information here:

Bill Page.

Axiom Conference Announcement
_____________________________

When:    April 22, 2005
Where:   The City College of New York
Contact: Bernice Ravitz <bernice@rio.sci.ccny.cuny.edu>

There will be a Conference on Axiom on April 22, 2005 at the City
College of New York. The focus of the conference will be to
demonstrate the power and scope of Axiom to a general scientific
audience. The conference is being hosted by CAISS, the Center for
Algorithmic and Interactive Scientific Software. Timothy Daly, a
senior research scientist at CAISS and a Research Associate in the
Computer Science Department of CCNY has been heavily involved in the
development of AXIOM over many years.

Axiom, developed by IBM and released as open source software by NAG,
has now been rebuilt by many developers into its original form
together with a new version for Windows. Preceding the conference, on
April 21st, will be a "sprint" day devoted to defining future
directions and a marathon programming session in the CAISS Open
Software Lab. Everyone is encouraged to participate. Help will be
available for new developers.

The Acting Dean of Engineering, Joe Barba and the Dean of Science,
Maria Tamargo, are sponsoring the conference, which is also supported
by the National Science Foundation. Further funding has been made
available by the Chancellor of the City University of New York, Dr.
Matthew Goldstein and the Provost of the City College of New York,
Zeev Dagan, for both travel and accommodation for some participants
and attendees of one or other or both events.

Details of the talks on April 22nd and the get-together on April 21st
will be posted on the CAISS web-site, www.caissny.org in the next few
weeks.

Anyone interested in attending should email
Bernice Ravitz <bernice@rio.sci.ccny.cuny.edu>.

The conference is being organized by Gilbert Baumslag, Timothy Daly,
Gretchen Ostheimer, William Sit and Douglas Troeger.

I am trying to make Axiom evaluate sum(1/k^2, k=3D1..n).  It returns the =
sum
unevaluated.  I suspect that I should be using the sum functions defined
in package SUMRF, RationalFunctionSum, but how do I make Axiom use those
functions?  For example, I tried

(1) -> sum(1/k^2, k=3D1..n)$SUMRF

    Although RationalFunctionSum is the name of a constructor, a full
       type must be specified in the context you have used it. Issue
       )show RationalFunctionSum for more information.
(1) ->

I don't understand what I have to do here.  My understanding of Axiom's t=
ypes,
domains, and packages is limited, but shouldn't sum(...) be smart enough =
by itself
to invoke the right "sum"?

Kostas,

My previous reply did not address the issue of the reason why
Axiom returns the sum unevaluated. Here is what I could find out:

I expect the reason that it returns unevaluated is because Axiom
is simply incomplete. For example Maple gives:

> sum(1/k^2, k=1..n);
                                      1   2
                     -Psi(1, n + 1) + - Pi 
                                      6    

Axiom does have the Polygamma function, so we can write:

(3) -> f1(n)==sum(1/k^2, k=1..n)
                                                                   Type:

You should follow the instructions that Axiom gives you. :)

)show RationalFunctionSum

says:

(2) -> )show RationalFunctionSum
 RationalFunctionSum R: Join(IntegralDomain,OrderedSet,
    RetractableTo Integer) is a package constructor
 Abbreviation for RationalFunctionSum is SUMRF
 This constructor is exposed in this frame.
 Issue )edit C:/Program =
Files/axiom/mnt/windows/../../src/algebra/SUMRF.spad
 to see algebra source code for SUMRF

------------------------------- Operations =

 sum : (Polynomial R,Symbol) -> Fraction Polynomial R
 sum : (Fraction Polynomial R,Symbol) ->
       Union(Fraction Polynomial R,Expression R)
 sum : (Polynomial R,SegmentBinding Polynomial R) ->
       Fraction Polynomial R
 sum : (Fraction Polynomial R,SegmentBinding Fraction Polynomial R) ->
        Union(Fraction Polynomial R,Expression R)

--------

If you look carefully you will see that RationalFunctionSum requires
a paramter R that is one of IntegralDomain, OrderedSet, or at least
RetractableTo Integer

 RationalFunctionSum R: Join(IntegralDomain,OrderedSet,
                             RetractableTo Integer)

So try this:

(1) -> sum(1/k^2, k=3D1..n)$SUMRF INT

         n
        --+    1
   (1)  >     --

First, it is important to remember that Axiom types often have
parameters. SUMRF is a "constructor" - that means that it is a
"function" that expects to take as a parameter another type,
e.g. RationalFunctionSum(Integer), and returns a new type.

Second, there are many different "sum" functions in Axiom,
each with a different signature. Sometimes you have to specify
exactly which one you mean.

(2) -> )display op sum

There are 6 exposed functions called sum :
   [1] (D1,Symbol) -> D1 from FunctionSpaceSum(D3,D1)
            if D3 has Join(IntegralDomain,OrderedSet,RetractableTo
            Integer,LinearlyExplicitRingOver Integer) and D1 has Join(
            FunctionSpace D3,CombinatorialOpsCategory,
            AlgebraicallyClosedField,TranscendentalFunctionCategory)

   [2] (D1,SegmentBinding D1) -> D1 from FunctionSpaceSum(D3,D1)
            if D1 has Join(FunctionSpace D3,CombinatorialOpsCategory,
            AlgebraicallyClosedField,TranscendentalFunctionCategory)
            and D3 has Join(IntegralDomain,OrderedSet,RetractableTo
            Integer,LinearlyExplicitRingOver Integer)
   [3] (Polynomial D4,Symbol) -> Fraction Polynomial D4
            from RationalFunctionSum D4
            if D4 has Join(IntegralDomain,OrderedSet,RetractableTo
            Integer)
   [4] (Fraction Polynomial D4,Symbol) -> Union(Fraction Polynomial D4,
            Expression D4)
            if D4 has Join(IntegralDomain,OrderedSet,RetractableTo
            Integer)
   [5] (Polynomial D4,SegmentBinding Polynomial D4) -> Fraction
            Polynomial D4
            from RationalFunctionSum D4
            if D4 has Join(IntegralDomain,OrderedSet,RetractableTo
            Integer)
   [6] (Fraction Polynomial D4,SegmentBinding Fraction Polynomial D4)
             -> Union(Fraction Polynomial D4,Expression D4)
            from RationalFunctionSum D4
            if D4 has Join(IntegralDomain,OrderedSet,RetractableTo
            Integer)

There are 5 unexposed functions called sum :
   [1] (D2,D3,Segment D2) -> Record(num: D2,den: Integer)
            from InnerPolySum(D5,D3,D6,D2)
            if D2 has POLYCAT(D6,D5,D3) and D5 has OAMONS and D3 has
            ORDSET and D6 has INTDOM
   [2] (D2,D3) -> Record(num: D2,den: Integer) from InnerPolySum(D4,D3,
            D5,D2)
            if D4 has OAMONS and D3 has ORDSET and D5 has INTDOM and D2
            has POLYCAT(D5,D4,D3)
   [3] (OutputForm,OutputForm,OutputForm) -> OutputForm from OutputForm

   [4] (OutputForm,OutputForm) -> OutputForm from OutputForm
   [5] OutputForm -> OutputForm from OutputForm
(2) ->

----------

But if you don't need to specify which one, Axiom can often make
a reasonable choice based on default assumptions about types.

(2) -> sum(1/k^2, k=3D1..n)

         n
        --+    1
   (2)  >     --
        --+    2
        k=3D 1  k
                                          Type: Union(Expression
Integer,...)
(3) ->

Bill,

Thanks very much for the elucidation.  By way of background, I have been =
using Mathematica
for about 10 years, and I'm contemplating a switch to Axiom.

It seems that Axiom is, let's say, "conceptually", very advanced in the s=
ense of its domains,
types, categories, etc.  Perhaps we could call that its abstract mathemat=
ical knowledge.  This
is notably absent from Mathematica, until at least v5.0, which is almost =
current.

But I was disappointed by the sum(1/k^2, k=3D1..n) example.  I saw that G=
osper's method is
implemented in sum.spad.pamphlet, but this (rather simple) sum needs symb=
olic manipulation
of gamma and psi functions, which is not there.  More generally, special =
functions seem to be
handled only numerically.  At least for my prospective use of Axiom, this=
 points to a rather big
"hole". And I wonder how many others of this sort there are.

I also tried sum(1/(k*(k+a)), k=3D1..n).  That was also returned unevalua=
ted, although Gosper's
method should handle it.  Why is that?  I don't mind reading the book, so=
 if somewhere there is
a discussion of (limitations of) symbolic evaluation, please point me the=
re.

I have been using Maple for more than 10 years and I am also
contemplating a switch to Axiom. Of course you know that I have
been helping to make Axiom available, but I continue to use
Maple for most research. I find that there are many things I
know immediately how to do in Maple but discovering how to do
them in Axiom takes time. However I remain convinced that my
time spent with Axiom will be beneficial to me (and hopefully
to others) in the long term.

I agree. In it's approach to the formal representation of
mathematics Axiom is probably "conceptually" superior to any
other computer algebra system.

I agree. And now comes my pitch: Axiom is open source. This
means that having identified and documented this deficiency

(The best place to do this is:
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage/issuetracker
)

anyone with sufficient knowledge and motivation can extend Axiom
to solve these problems. These extensions will become part of
the free Axiom distribution. That's why creating the environment
where such contributions are encouraged is so important.

> And I wonder how many others of this sort there are.

I am sure there are many. For reasons that have nothing at all
to do with Axiom's "conceptually" advanced mathematics, Axiom
has remained essentially static since about 1995, while during
the last 10 years both Mathematica and Maple have made steady
advances. (But perhaps not as much as we would like. :)

On the other hand, there are also some things which Axiom
implements which have not found there way into any commerical
system yet.

I don't know, but I think this is exactly the kind of thing
that should be reported at

I am not aware of any discussions on the limitations of symbolic
evaluation in Axiom except here, on the axiom-developer email
list and on MathAction:

The February 2005 release of Axiom has been posted to:

 savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom
 sourceforge.net/projects/axiom
 arch.axiom-developer.org as axiom--main--1--patch-29

This is the first "feature complete" release of Axiom. It includes
all of the algebra we have available, working graphics, and a working
hyperdoc browser. Once you build the system you can test it by typing:

axiom

when the hyperdoc browser starts choose

  Basic Commands -> Draw -> A function of two variables -> Continue -> Do It

and a graph will appear. Click anywhere on the graph to get the control panel.

A Source tarball and binaries for several platforms are being compiled
and will be uploaded as they become available.

Please report any bugs at:

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage/IssueTracker

This is a wiki page and you can modify it from your browser to add bugs.
Please be sure to note the 'Version' listed on the banner when Axiom 
starts so we can track which version has the bug.

Questions should be sent to the axiom-developer@nongnu.org mailing list.

The February 2005 release is known to build on RedHat and Fedora systems
including Fedora 3. Be sure to use the ./configure script.

The Solaris 9 merger is still in process and may not yet build correctly
from these sources. A working version of Axiom has been built for Solaris 9
which includes both graphics and hyperdoc. The ./configure script should
properly recognize the solaris system.

The Windows merger is still in process and may not yet build correctly
from these sources. A working version of the algebra but not the graphics
and hyperdoc exists. Efforts are underway to make portable versions of
the graphics and hyperdoc but that will take a while. See
http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/AxiomDownload

The MAC OSX port is being worked on. There is no further news.

The March 2005 release is now open for changes.
Immediate items of work are:
  finish and test Solaris 9 changes
  finish and merge Windows changes
  finish and merge the "fixed-point" changes to the algebra
  automate patch file handling in hyperdoc
  create beta version of MAC OSX
  first steps toward hypertex in common lisp
  create pre-print version of volume 1 (tutorial) of book
  continue bug collection from axiom-developer mailing list to IssueTracker

The --patch-29 change is a simple typo.

I looked in all three sites for the February release, but 
it appears nowhere to my relatively unpracticed eye. Is 
this release really where advertized below?
