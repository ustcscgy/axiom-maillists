Dear Lonnie,

Do you have hyperdoc? there you can simply enter floor or sqrt and you will get
what you want.

Otherwise, issue (at the command prompt)

(1) -> )di op floor

There are 2 exposed functions called floor :
   [1] D -> D1 from D
            if D has QFCAT D1 and D1 has INTDOM and D1 has INS
   [2] D -> D from D if D has RNS

This means: there is a function floor from something which is a Quotientfield
of an IntegralDomain into this IntegralDomain (and this IntegralDomain has to
be an IntegerNumberSystem, too), and

there is a function floor from a RealNumberSystem into the same
RealNumberSystem.

Maybe you could make your question more precise.

Well, there are things you definitely cannot do in Mathematica, but that are
easily achieved in Axiom. These two systems are simply *different* and have
quite different focus.
