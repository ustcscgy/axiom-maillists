Thanks for any information that you can provide on this topic.

I would like to use  the DiophantineSolutionPackage (DIOSP) to solve  some
equations.  I don't know how and the information that I have found is too
cryptic for me to decipher.  A single example would be much appreciated.

You probably already have the source code and associated
documentation but for reference you can access it online here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/SolvedioSpad

The author of the package, Albrecht Fortenbacher has a related
publication:

@article{DBLP:journals/jsc/ClausenF89,
  author    =3D {Michael Clausen and
               Albrecht Fortenbacher},
  title     =3D {Efficient Solution of Linear Diophantine Equations.},
  journal   =3D {J. Symb. Comput.},
  volume    =3D {8},
  number    =3D {1/2},
  year      =3D {1989},
  pages     =3D {201-216},
  bibsource =3D {DBLP, http://dblp.uni-trier.de}
}

http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=3DGUIDE&dl=3DGUIDE&id=3D70576

See also:

http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/249287.html

and related citations. Unfortunately I was not able to find any of
these online.

In Axiom you can use DIOSP like this:

(1) -> dioSolve(x+2*y+3*z=3D4)

   (1)  [varOrder=3D [x,y,z],inhom=3D =
[[0,2,0],[1,0,1],[2,1,0],[4,0,0]],hom=3D []]

Type: Record(varOrder: List Symbol,
  inhom: Union(List Vector NonNegativeInteger,"failed"),
  hom: List Vector NonNegativeInteger)

Hi,

I am new to Axiom, I am studying theoretical physics (4th grade) in
Prague and I want to use the computer algebra system as a physicist
and I understand that mathematicians are looking at the mathematics
from a completely different angle than physicists. But anyway, I want
this:

I have a diagonal matrix:

gdd=Matrix((
    (-exp(nu(r)),0,0,0),
    (0, exp(lam(r)), 0, 0),
    (0, 0, r**2, 0),
    (0, 0, 0, r**2*sin(theta)**2)
    ))

that is a metric tensor on a 4 dimensional manifold with signature
(-,+,+,+), this corresponds to g_\mu_\nu (i.e. the indices are
lowered). No I want to calculate the Christoffel symbols -> riemann
tensor -> ricci tensor.

the x^\mu vector are variables (t, r, theta, phi). The nu(r) and
lam(r) are unknown functions of "r".  I am interested in the
(differential) equations for the unknown functions nu(r) and lam(r)
that I get by setting:

R_\mu_\nu = 0

If you need some more explanation, I'll be glad to explain the details.

In maple I can use the grtensor

http://grtensor.org/

package, but I find the maple not suitable for me, as I want to use
the symbolic manipulation in my programs and I don't want to use the
ugly maple language.

I found all the other symbolic packages unsuitable for me, so I wrote my own:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

And in SymPy I can now do it quite easily:

http://sympy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/examples/relativity.py

SymPy is just a general package and all I am using from it are just
symbolic matrices. (I am lowering and raising indices by myself in the
relativity.py example).

I was curious - how could I do the same in Axiom?

Thanks,
Ondrej

BTW, the resulting equations are:

-1/4*exp(\nu(r))*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)*\lambda'(r)*\nu'(r)+1/4*exp(\nu(r))*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)*\nu'(r)**2+1/2*exp(\nu(r))*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)*(\nu'(r))'+exp(\nu(r))*r**(-1)*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)*\nu'(r)
= 0
1/4*\nu'(r)*\lambda'(r)-1/2*(\nu'(r))'+r**(-1)*\lambda'(r)-1/4*\nu'(r)**2 = 0
-1/2*r*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)*\nu'(r)+1/2*r*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)*\lambda'(r)-sin(\theta)**(-2)*cos(\theta)**2-(-1-sin(\theta)**(-2)*cos(\theta)**2)-exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)
= 0
-sin(\theta)**2*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)+sin(\theta)**2-1/2*sin(\theta)**2*r*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)*\nu'(r)+1/2*sin(\theta)**2*r*exp(\lambda(r))**(-1)*\lambda'(r)
= 0

Hi,

I am sorry for this stupid question - but how can I calculate the limit of:

(3**x+5**x)**(1/x)

for x->+infinity? The result is 5 as you can check by hand:

(3**x+5**x)**(1/x) = 5 * ((3/5)**x+1)**(1/x) -> 5

When I tried that in axiom:

limit((3**x+5**x)**(1/x), x=%+infinity)

or the equivalent problem:

limit((3**(1/x)+5**(1/x))**(x), x=0, "right")

I got "failed".

Also, this works correctly:

simplify(2**x * 2**(2*x))

simplifies to 2**(3x)

but this doesn't simplify at all:

simplify(2**(5*x)/2**(4*x))



Thanks,
Ondrej

Sorry, that seems like an intelligent question to me. ;)
But really there are no stupid questions, just stupid answers.

In fact I think it is a bug or at least a deficiency in Axiom
so I have reported it to IssueTracker here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/345

Thanks for pointing this out. Perhaps this can be corrected
fairly easily.

In Axiom you should write:

 limit((3**x+5**x)**(1/x), x=%plusInfinity)

But if you got "failed" as a result you probably wrote
%plusInfinity and it's just a typo in your email.

Same bug I guess.

In general, expression simplification in Axiom is not as
powerful as in most other CAS and often needs a little help.
Fortunately Axiom does have a fairly simple powerful pattern
matching feature so one way these simplifications can be done
is as follows:

(1) -> reduceExp := rule exp(x*log(y))==y^x

          x log(y)     x
   (1)  %e         == y
          Type: RewriteRule(Integer,Integer,Expression Integer)

(2) -> reduceExp  normalize (2**x * 2**(2*x))

         x
   (2)  8
                                       Type: Expression Integer

(3) -> reduceExp  normalize (2**(5*x)/2**(4*x))

         x
   (3)  2
                                       Type: Expression Integer

If you could suppress your revulsion of the Maple language, then I
could send you information about a package I wrote a few years ago
called TensorLite. I used it to do symbolic manipulation of tensors
in Maple V release 5 for calculations similar to that which you
describe. If you have Maple, you should be able to read this:

http://synthesis.anikast.ca/maple/mathematics/tensor5c.mws

If you have any interest, just let me know. With a little effort
I could probably remember what I was doing at that time...

Yes, isn't that the way things go in computer algebra - everyone
seems to write their own? :-( That's a pity. If what you really
want to do is physics, then it's a trap that many people have
fallen into. It took me a long time to get over that stage.

Actually I looked at SumPy a while back on Google Code. I think
its pretty cool. Do you know anything about Sage? Sage is another
computer algebra system that is written in Python, but they
incorporate a lot of other open source math software packages
such as Maxima, Gap, gmp, mpfr, etc. to do things not implemented
in native Python. Perhaps they would be interested in SymPy for
it's symbolic capabilities.

I would recommend that you consult the Axiom book:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/Mirrors?go=/public/book2.pdf&it=Axiom+Book

section 9.7 CartesianTensor

for some examples of how tensors are currently implemented in
Axiom. In some respects the support is rather primitive but on
the other hand one can take advantage of the symbolic capabilities
of the rest of the Axiom system.

You will also need:

section 1.13 Differential Equations  (introduction)

and

section 8.10 Solution of Differential Equations

Using these two parts of Axiom in principle it should not be
too difficult to do the calculations you want to do.

On the other hand if I ever somehow find some more time, I would
really like to implement much better support for tensors,
differential forms and abstract multilinear operators on vector
spaces in general (see for example related sections 9.14
DeRhamComplex, and 9.10 CliffordAlgebra). But that might be me
just falling into the same old trap again. Maybe it would be
better to wait for someone else to come along and do it for
me. ;)

But I don't think that expression simplification in general is Ondrej's 
point (see subject). In fact, he has implemented the algorithm of Gruntz 
  dissertation (http://www.cs.fh-aargau.ch/~gruntz/publications2.html) 
which is in Maple and there also seems to be an implementation in MuPad 
and Mathematica. Axiom is just lacking that new algorithm. Maybe we 
should also implement it and Ondrej could help to do so. (In fact, that 
would be a good small project for Google Summer.) Any volonteers out there?

Unfortunately, I haven't found a .pdf file of Gruntz thesis, but 
shouldn't we copy it to a section on 
http://portal.axiom-developer.org/refs ?

It's nice. I tried that on maple 9.5 and after a while it says:

Execution stopped: Stack limit reached. Worksheet lost contact with
kernel. You should save this worksheet and restart Maple.

Well, this is exactly a reason, why I find Maple completely unusable...
But anyway, I'll try to learn from your sheet in order to implement it
nicely in SymPy. Thanks.

Well, it depends. You cannot stay at that, you need to get some real
results, otherwise it's of course nonsense to create anything from
scratch. But SymPy, besides fun (which is very important) also allows
me to play with the differential geometry already. And I like it. I
like to play with ideas, so I think it was not a lost time.

Sure. I corresponded with Bobby Moretti quite a lot about the symbolic
manipulation, because he is writting something almost identical to
SymPy in SAGE right now, but currently SymPy is much more mature than
his code.

They are. I guess we'll wait until the summer is over, as I expect
some really good students to take part in. As we have on our webpage:

To sum it up: It would be nice to have an opensource alternative to
Maple/Mathematica, that is reasonably fast (maybe written in C++),
could be easily extended with your own ideas, would be callable from
python and could be used in real world problems (as Maple/Mathematica
can). SAGE is also trying to achieve this goal, but from a different
side - SymPy aims to be lightweight, whereas SAGE aims to glue
together every useful open source mathematics software package and
provide a transparent interface to all of them.

Thanks. I'll look at that. What surprises me, that there are not
already some examples of such usage of Axiom, as I think those are
things that everybody wants to play with at the beginning.

What I can say from my own experience - the time I spent implementing
some particular algorithms (limits, series expansion, gcd or square
free decomposition of polynomials) was completely negligible compared
to time spent inventing and designing the interface. I took GiNaC as a
starting point, but I improved things that I didn't like on it
(removed unnecessary classes etc). From Axiom I can just learn how to
do some particular symbolic algorithm, but as I said - this is not a
problem, as what SymPy does so far is very trivial from the
mathematical point of view.

What is not trivial is how to actually represent everything, and that
is an area, where noone actually knows how to do it. So even if the
only contribution of SymPy is that we actually showed that the CAS can
be done this way, it will be good.

I learned however how not to do things - I am in no way trying to
reinvent some new (better) language, even if that language was
actually better than Python. Actually, all the languages turned out to
be worse (Maple/Mathematica/Maxima). Maybe Aldor will turn out to be
better, but currently, from the technical point of view it isn't (many
bugs, almost nonexistent user base, not opensource, etc.). Your
argument is, that it is not important the language is not widespread,
but rather that it is the best option for a CAS. But then you are
immediately creating an obstacle for newcomers. It has it's
advantages, I understand that, but it also has a lot of disadvantages.

SymPy is going to be a library in a standard widespread language. We
chose Python. So I think we are not reinventing a wheel. We are just
trying to bring the CAS to masses, if I can use this expression. :)

I am not against you having fun. As an end in itself and as a
by-product of something else, that is fine. But even if you do get
some novel results after building a new tool, I would argue that
in almost every case you would be further ahead if you had
invested the same amount of time in learning to properly use
(and perhaps extend) some existing system.

Such open source alternatives already exist, e.g. Axiom and Maxima.
They are both written in Lisp and modern Lisp implementations are
certainly "reasonably fast", arguably perhaps as fast as C++. And
the Sage project demonstrates that these can be made callable from
python:

At the SymPy website

This is true of any large application in any programming language.
If you want to argue that it is a matter of degree, then I think
you are splitting hairs. Compared to advances in computer hardware,
software technology lags very far behind. It is the constraint in
any large project no matter what tools you choose.

That is simply not true. Most standardization in programming
languages occurs by de facto adoption despite efforts by various
standards organizations. Maple has permitted coding in an
object oriented manner since release 9 (see Maple modules). It
could be easily argued that Axiom (alias ScratchPad) applied
the concepts of object-oriented design and polymorphic type
systems almost two decades before these were even recognized
as interesting programming paradigms by the rest of the
computer science and mathematics communities. So up-to-date
is largely a matter of perspective or else Axiom was and
still remains ahead of it's time.

Yet this is exactly the kind of problems that the designers of

I *very* strongly disagree with this statement as the main
purpose of symbolic computation. At best it is only one possible
purpose. Simplification is too ambiguous and subjective a concept.
What is simple and easy to understand by one person may not be
simple or easy to another. As far as I am concerned the purpose
of symbolic computation is to accurately and correctly do by
computer some of what mathematicians do when they manipulate
mathematical objects. In a very real sense all computation done
by modern digital computers is symbolic. The only distinction
that I can make between symbolic computations and numeric
computation is that the former is almost always concerned with
exact results while the later is usually concerned with
approximate results.

This is very unclear. It seems to me that the main reason that
beginners are so interested in simplification is usually because
they wish to show (or even prove) that some presumably unintuitive
equality holds. They rely on the expression manipulation performed
by the simplification routines to be exact in the sense of
preserving the mathematical correctness of the result while
reducing these expressions to some sort of canonical form. The
problem is that it can be shown that this problem is undecidable
in general and can be carried out effectively only in certain
well defined domains.

Actually Axiom takes exactly this philosophy. As a result it's
"simplify" operation is comparatively "weak" in comparison
to most other general purpose computer algebra systems. Instead
Axiom goes to considerable length to represent in detail what
is meant by a "domain" of computation. Equality is one of the
operations exported by particular domains. More on this later.

There is quite a large literature about Axiom. See the bibliography

I am not sure what you mean by "From Axiom I can just learn
how to do some particular symbolic algorithm.". Specific algorithms
are only a part of the problem. Axiom goes very much beyond that.

In fact that is exactly the point that is being addressed by Axiom.
Axiom does provide (at least in principle) the means to represent
everything. I disagree that no one knows how to do it. I think the
Axiom designers showed very clearly how many areas of advanced and
abstract mathematics could be coded and represented in a computer
in addition to the more pedestrian concerns of data structures and
algorithms.

What do you think is novel about the way that SymPy implements
computer algebra?

I think the concept of better and worse are too vague and subjective.
You need to state clearly the objectives and find a way to quantify
the differences between languages. I think this is a very difficult
problem.

Aldor is the 2nd generation Axiom library compiler language but it
is not quite yet available as open source, although many people do
have to it by individual request to aldor.org. SPAD is the first
generation language and it is available with Axiom. Over 1300
mathematical domains are currently implemented in SPAD so I think
there is good reason to believe that it is suitable for very
large scale projects. Aldor improves on SPAD in several ways and
the aldor.org website promises that Aldor will be available as
open source very soon now.

I think SPAD and Aldor are much better suited to describing
mathematics for the purposes of computer algebra than any other
programming language now in common use. Since the accurate
representation of mathematical objects and the efficient coding
of mathematical algorithms is central to the goals of computer
algebra, I do think they are the best option for a CAS.

That is true. But one thing to note that at least in general
form, i.e. syntax and data structures, SPAD and Aldor and the
Axiom library are actually very similar to Python and were
implemented as much as 20 years earlier than Python and similar
languages.

What "wheel" are we talking about? The programming language or
the computer algebra system? Much of what you are trying to do
with SymPy does indeed look like re-invention to me.

No, I doubt very much if this is possible, at least not any
more than it is possible to bring advanced abstract mathematics
to the masses. It takes years to appreciate the value of doing
certain things certain ways and at least part of this is based
on often unstated cultural and historical biases.

Bill Page.

Dear Bill, Ondrej,

I'd like to make two differences between the extension languages of Maple,
Mathematica, MuPAD on one hand, and Aldor on the other hand very clear.

Aldor has semantics which are very well explained (in great detail, see the
"Aldor Compiler User Guide"), and are reduced to very few important
concepts. Most importantly: Types are first class objects and every object has
a type. This implies, for example, that the result of a function may be a type,
as is the case with the "Fraction" constructor, or the "Polynomial" constructor
in Axiom.

The current implementation of Aldor is quite good at following those
semantics. Really, with Aldor one should distinguish between the implementation
and the language. It is quite clear what is a bug and what is a feature,
although, of course, there are some borderline cases.

In other words, the definition of Aldor does *not* go like "Aldor is the
language implemented by the current Aldor compiler", but rather "Aldor is the
language as described in the Aldor Compiler User Guide", and there is an
implementation that tries hard to follow this guide.

If you look at it this way, you can *really* say that SPAD is version 1 of the
Aldor compiler, although this is not true historically. There are astonishingly
few semantic differences and some syntactic differences, but mostly, SPAD
implements simply a subset of what is described in the Aldor Compiler User
Guide.

I left out Maxima on purpose, since I believe that the "true" Maxima extension
language is Ansi Common Lisp, although the current group of developers thinks
otherwise.

If you can come up with a semantic description of Mathematica's extension
language, please tell Richard Fateman, since he tried but failed. :-)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Concerning simplification, I'd like to add that this is really a
non-concept. The real concept behind it is "normal form" or "canonical form",
or at least, "test for zero".  And in fact, Axiom is very strong in those
domains very you have one of those things.  And that's exactly why I'd like to
have my hierarchy "rational - ... - differentially algebraic functions"
implemented in Axiom, since they all allow test for zero, and an incredible
amount of functions occurring in practice falls into one of these
domains. Although, the example you gave for the limit computation does not, as
far as I can see.



All the best,

Martin

Hi Martin and Bill,

I understand your point. You realized you need a well defined
(general) language, and Aldor is it's implementation. This is much
better than Maple/Mathematica, I agree.

I am just addressing the technological point of view - you have a nice
language, tuned to the purpose of the CAS. This is certainly one way
to go.

There is certainly another way to go however, and that is the way I
took - don't reinvent some language, just take already working
language with a specification and a working (open source)
implementation. And a large userbase.

I think those are quite philosophical questions and it's not clear
which approach is better. So you just need to make some decision, and
I did one (with good arguments), you did another (with good
arguments).

Ondrej

I think the idea of "general consumption" computer algebra systems
might be more usefully viewed as domain specific computation.  If you
think about the mathematical abilities that are required for applied
mathematics, they typically consist of a fairly small subset of
theoretical mathematics.  Within those subsets there are still many
difficult problems, but I think the reason calculations work in such
systems is that there are many "hidden" assumptions that result in
operations not possible or useful in general applying for all cases of
interest to a given problem domain.

This might also explain why so many people have tried to create
"variables with types" in Axiom.  I think what at least some people are
actually trying to do there is to restrict Axiom to a domain of
computation where some of the behaviors they are used to in
mathematical calculation from either their other training or other CAS
systems can be applied.  In theory, this might actually be possible.

What would result, in such a scenario, would be "personalities" on top
of the rigorous Axiom core.  The mathematics at all levels would still
be backed by the correctness of the Axiom system, but (say) a physics
professor or student could define or use a pre-existing set of
assumptions that would result in a mathematical environment that is
familiar and more practical.

This is not a new idea, but the details of implementing it are not at
all simple.  Indefinite Types, "provisos", and other such mechanisms
would be necessary, as well as a system wide awareness of those
mechanisms.  I personally think this is very much worth doing, but such
large scale projects must wait on more mundane and practical matters. 
Either an open source Aldor or a more well defined, rigorous and
extended SPAD would be needed for any project of that magnitude, and
while progress is being made it will be a while.

It's a pity there doesn't seem to be much institutional support for
research into these matters.  IIRC the NSF doesn't fund work in areas
where there is commercial activity, but it's rather difficult to argue
that the commercial systems are likely to head in this direction -
there are few immediate commercial incentives to do so.

Anyway, I'm hopeful that someday "CAS for the masses" will consist of
not a whole new simplified system but of defining in Axiom or something
like it a set of assumptions and constraints that creates the
simplified environment.  To me that makes the most sense for both
correctness and "expandibility" - as people need new ideas they can
incrementally add them, examining the consequences of each (for
example, expanding the domain of numbers under consideration from Reals
to Reals+Imaginary).  There's no particular reason I can see to abandon
rigor for simplicity - if the mathematics is valid it should be just a
question of defining the assumptions made to "simplify" the notation
for new users.

Cheers,
CY

Hi CY,

you got precisely to the point. And, getting back to my original
email, my first sentences were about mathematicians looking at the
mathematics completely differently.

I, personally, don't know, if it is possible to have a simple CAS for
masses and also being it able to build on it more rigorous and
abstract mathematics. As you said, what is really needed in physics is
a very limited subset of mathematics (basically just calculus,
integrals on k-manifolds in n-dimensions, differential equations,
matrices, noncommutative algebras like Pauli or Dirac, series, limits,
asymptotic expansion, complex numbers, but that's all). Ok, then some
stuff like recurence relations, tensors, etc., but all of this I just
call a simple calculus. I want the CAS for masses to be really good at
this simple calculus.

If someones finds a way how to do more advanced stuff, why not, but I
am not interested in that primarily, as it is not needed. And if the
more advanced stuff renders this basic calculus less usable, then I am
completely against it. On the other hand, you have exactly the
opposite opinion - if something is not exact, let's not talk about it.
If, as a side effect, the CAS could also be used for masses, then why
not, but primarily you are concerned with mathematical formalism.

So I think this is the core difference between me and most developers of Axiom.

I am not saying that you or me should be wrong - this is just the
basic difference between mathematicians and physicists.

As a simple example - if it is not able to simplify simple powers or
to do a simple limit (see my older emails on that), then it's not for
me.

Sure.  Some of that is probably bugs, and some might be more subtle. 
But in theory, if it is mathematically valid than Axiom can probably be
brought to a point where it can be done.  I suspect provisos and
variables with type would be necessary mechanisms, but we aren't there
yet.  Axiom took the approach (in my view the correct one) of being a
strong system first, with convenience being built on top of the strong
foundation.  That approach stands a chance of working in the long term,
but obviously has convenience consequences in the short term.

That's why I think both Maxima and Axiom have a place in the open
source computer algebra world.  Maxima is very much about getting the
job done, and does fairly well.  Axiom is about Doing It Right, and
eventually getting to the point where the more "applied" or "casual"
use modes might be supported as special cases.  Maxima means people
don't have to wait, and Axiom is working on the long term viable
approach.  It's like using a wagon to cross the US vs. building a
railway across it.  Yes, if you only want to cross once and start
farming you can use the wagon, but in the long run the railway will
open up a lot more possibilities and it's worth the extra pain to build
it.

Cheers,
CY

I agree with you. So SymPy is rather competing with Maxima than with Axiom.

Maybe you would like The Zen of Python (by Tim Peters), it's something
like an anthem of Python and it's actually built in the Python
interpreter :). I share this philosophy in SymPy completely:

ondra@syslik:~$ python
Python 2.4.4 (#2, Jan 13 2007, 17:50:26)
[GCC 4.1.2 20061115 (prerelease) (Debian 4.1.1-21)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import this
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

I'm very iteresting by the question.
   Is there a CAS for "masses" ?

Let me tell my point of view...

I must use Maple with my beginning graduate students. 
About 1 hour per week for them.

Maple isnot a great idea because the language isn't typed.
There is only one type of matrix, 0 in Integer = 0 in Float, and so.
This makes problems almost at every course. 
Computations with Mupad was more right because the language was typed.

My exercices uses both algebra and calculus abilities.

By example study the Tchebytcheff scalarProduct :

<P,Q> = integrate (P(t)*Q(t)/sqrt(1-t^2), t=-1..1)
  creates matrix in LinearAlgebra                   (1)
     uses Risch method for Integrate                (2)
      and eigenValues in linearAlgebra 
     calls polynomialSolve in polynomial algebra    (3)
  or calls numericalSolve in numerical analysis.    (4)

I don't forget differential equation (5) for orthogonal polynomial 
or recurrent (more or less) linear sequents         (6)
I'm also looking for combinatorial analysis         (7) 
power-series with theses coefficients (8) or Fourier series (9), 
and plots (10) abilities.

So I need a large CAS which all theses 10 domains. 
If only one is missing I only can do 70% of the exercices, 
        two are missing ... .... ... 0.7x0.7 = 49% 
       three ... ...                 35 %, and so.

Little systems as derive or maxima hasn't all these chapters.

Maybe it's easiest to write a naivePackage which uses big algorithms 
for axiom than to improve a too little systems.

So axiom has advantages ! but... hasn't yet all these purposes.
By example Expression are irrelevant with analysis course.

The axiom/aldor/spad interpreter allows to choose the package we prefer.
For this use, Expressions isn't right. I might write a Calculus domain 
which uses almost the same code that Expression and then call the 
axiom Risch algorithm or the standard limit functions. 
I'll don't have to rewrite these functions They are already in Axiom.

But...

Find the good domain in the typed language as axiom isn't so easy.

It's quicker to insert the good test in a low typed language
(see the maple or the mupad code...) 
Of corse there are more bugs by this way, 
but we get quickly an often(?) right result.

I'm impressed how axiom results are right 
(as other typed languages, caml is fine also)
but it's really complex to analysis. One example : 
In almost all CAS abs z = sqrt (z * conjugate z) without any question.
but I don't find so obvious the use of abs in axiom if there is no sqrt 
function in the domain. 

Many reefs in axiom force me to use axiom less I would like :

My code isn't pretty because I write it line after line with a lot of
assigment after each operation. It's the only way I found to get a compiled
package. 
When I use functional way with map, select or composed functions,
my functions don't compile. I make too errors and don't find them.

After this, I must enter in pamphlet files tricks, it's not nice.
Of corse pamphlet files is a good idea in order to keep an homogenous 
system.
    
So Yesterday when I was working arround
cos (4*a), cos a^4 + sin a^4,... , I used axiom with 
subst (expand cos (a+b+c+d), [b=a, c=a, d=a]) 
even if others CAS allows the expand (cos (4*a)).
Lacks as this one make axiom not interesting for my colleagues.

My work isn't to be an axiom developper, 
I only use few hours CAS per weeks in my work and 
I can't bid pehaps around 100 hours for improving expand.

I suspect that arguments about typed language  in CAS may be more
convincing by studying cases where the type system does add value,
greatly help solve problems that are much more difficult to tackle
with a weakly typed language.  Otherwise, I suspect we'll get lost in
"computer scientists" discussions about advanced type systems.
