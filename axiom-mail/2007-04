The Caley-Hamilton theorem is for me a very good example.
I admire the Martin reponse.

               Parallel Symbolic Computation 2007 (PASCO 2007)

                   July 27-28, 2007 -- London Canada

                http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/pasco2007

                         Second Announcement and 

                      C A L L   f o r   P A P E R S

  Extended Submission Deadline
  Invited Speakers
  ACM Proceedings

Overview:

  The pervasive ubiquity of parallel architectures, from SMPs to multi-core 
  laptops, has led to a new quest for mathematical algorithms and software 
  capable of exploiting these computing resources. Symbolic computation 
  offers exciting, but highly complex, challenges to scientists aiming to 
  contribute to this quest.

  The goal of the present workshop is to stimulate the development of 
  parallel algorithms and software for achieving high performance in symbolic 
  computation from grids to home computers. Earlier meetings in this series  
  include PASCO '94 in Linz, Austria and PASCO '97 in Maui, U.S.A.

  PASCO 2007 is affiliated with the 2007 International Symposium on Symbolic 
  and Algebraic Computation (ISSAC 2007). Co-located with this workshop will 
  be SNC 2007, the 2007 International Workshop on Symbolic-Numeric Computation.
  SNC and PASCO will be held immediately prior to the ISSAC 2007 meeting, both
  at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. ISSAC 2007 will be held nearby 
  in Waterloo, Canada.

Invited Speakers:

  The conference is pleased to announce the following invited speakers.

    * Michael A. Bauer, Univ. of Western Ontario
    * Matteo Frigo, Cilk Arts
    * Thierry Gautier, INRIA
    * Anthony D. Kennedy, Edinburg Univ. (Jointly with SNC)
    * Katherine Yelick, Univ. of California at Berkeley 

Call for Papers:

  The program of PASCO 2007 will include invited presentations, contributed
  research papers and posters. Specific topics include, but are not
  limited to:

   * Parallel computer algebra
   * Design of high performance software tools and interfaces
     for exact and approximate procedures
   * Design and analysis of parallel algorithms for algebraic
     computations
   * Parallel computing for number theory, geometry, automatic 
     theorem proving, combinatorial and discrete methods
   * Distributed data-structures for matrices and polynomials
   * Implementations of solvers on multi-cores, SMPs, clusters,
     supercomputers and grids
   * Interactive parallel symbolic computation
   * Volunteer computing for symbolic problems
   * Applications of parallel symbolic computation

  The conference invites submission of papers presenting original research,
  either in the form of extended abstracts (2 pages) or full papers
  (up to 10 pages) in ACM format.  A LaTeX class file is available at
  http://www.orcca.on.ca/conferences/pasco2007/site/submission/submission.html .
  To submit a paper, visit http://www.easychair.org/PASCO2007.

  Conference proceedings will be published by ACM and also be in the 
  ACM Digital Library.  (To do this we have had to revise the due date for
  the camera ready version of accepted articles.)

I would recommend that you run Axiom with i/o redirection
like this:

  $ AXIOMsys < MyInput > MyOutput

The file MyInput can contain all interactive commands
even including:

  )set output tex on
  )read MyFile.input
  )quit
  yes

if you wish.

Is this the kind of script you mean? If you need a "cleaner"
output, on Linux it is possible to run Axiom via Python or
Perl and parse the output as you need it.

Bill Page.

I've just started experimenting with Axiom (under Linux); I have two
questions:

1) is there any help other than HyperDoc?  So that, for example, I can find
out about "integrate" within Axiom?

2) are the only two interfaces the text interface and TeXmacs?

Thanks very much,
Alasdair

I&#39;ve just started experimenting with Axiom (under Linux); I have two questions:<br><br>1) is there any help other than HyperDoc?&nbsp; So that, for example, I can find out about &quot;integrate&quot; within Axiom?<br><br>2) are the only two interfaces the text interface and TeXmacs?

a) HyperDoc is tightly integrated with Axiom.  Do you have trouble using it?
(If so, please indicate which distribution of axiom you are using. Currently,
wh-sandbox, an axiom distribution maintained by Waldek Hebisch, fixes - as far
as I know - all troubles previously encountered with HyperDoc.  In particular,
the buttons "users" and "uses" work.)

In HyperDoc, you should click on 'browse', then enter "integrate" and click on
'operations'.  You should then obtain quite detailed help.  I strongly
recommend that you make yourself familiar with HyperDoc.

b) Otherwise, you can get some help within the axiom shell. But really, I'd say
that this sort of help -- except of the very first one below -- is rather for
experts...  Issue one of the following:

)what things integrate
)what operations integrate
)what packages integrate
)what domains integrate
)what categories integrate

)display operations integrate

all commands may be abbreviated as long as they remain unique. I.e., you may
also issue

)wh th integrate

instead.  If the resulting information doesn't tell you much, go back to
HyperDoc :-)

c) possibly you could use "asq" as follows from the axiom shell:

)sys -op integrate

but it didn't work on my box, I'll have to check that.

> 2) are the only two interfaces the text interface and TeXmacs?

Sort of.  Personally, I use emacs shell mode, which I find very comfortable.
As far as I know, there is a specialised emacs mode available, too, please ask
Cliff Yapp <smustudent1@yahoo.com>.

All the best

Martin

It's not what I would call finished, but it should be functional.  The
pamphlet is at http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxAxiomEmacsMode

Install it like any other emacs mode - usually
/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp is where I put it.

I stick this in my .emacs file:
(autoload 'axiom-mode "axiom" "Axiom mode" t)

and then launch with 

emacs -f axiom-mode  (handy if you want to make a menu entry starting
up Axiom in emacs, for example - obviously you can start it in Emacs as
well).

I have run it successfully on Windows (except for a bug in overlays
which prevents turning the input red on alteration from working as
expected) but I don't have a handy install.exe with it all bundled -
that might be something worth putting together the next time we get
around to a Windows release.  (Given we don't have hyperdoc for Windows
and the Windows command line is not likely to be comfortable for most
users...)

Cheers,
CY

Hi there,

I'm sorry to keep harping on about this same issue, but I do find it a real
sticking point.  When I attempt to learn a new software system (such as a
new CAS) I spend a lot of time in the help pages, looking at examples,
seeing how things are done; reading online tutorials and introductions.  I
find help in Axiom very hard to access.  To use HyperDoc, and to enjoy the
benefits of decent typesetting in TeXmacs, it seems I need two instances of
axiom running.  And there is no functions/commands help available from the
command line (such as there is with Maxima, Maple, Mathematica, MuPAD etc).

And even in HyperDoc, there are very few examples.  For instance, I was
trying to find the defining polynomial of a finite field.  I discovered that
there is a command definingPolynomial, but I couldn't find any examples on
its use, nor a comprehensive help page about it.  There are some simple
examples in HyperDoc (calculus, graphics, linear algebra etc), which is
incredibly helpful, but there doesn't seem to be this level of help
available for ALL commands, as I believe there should be.

>From my limited understanding, it would seem that Axiom is superb for the
development  and implementation of mathematical algorthms (such as Martin
Rubey's Guess package), but that it would go even further, and have greater
reach in the mathematical community, with more comprehensive, and more
easily accessible help.

Please don't take my comments as overly critical; I am speaking from a
beginner's perspective.  But sometimes it's hard for experts to see things
through a beginner's, or learner's eyes.

cheers,
Alasdair

Alasdair,

Let me address your last comment first:

Quoting Alasdair McAndrew:

> experts to see things through a beginner's, or learner's eyes. 

On the contrary, I think your views as a beginner are VERY
valuable to us. The more verbose and critical you are willing to
be (within reason of course :), the better.

That is not quite true. There are commands like the following:

(1) -> )summary
  )credits      : list the people who have contributed to Axiom

  )help <command> gives more information
  )quit         : exit AXIOM

  )abbreviation : query, set and remove abbreviations for
                  constructors
  )cd           : set working directory
  )clear        : remove declarations, definitions or values
  )close        : throw away an interpreter client and workspace
  )compile      : invoke constructor compiler
  )display      : display Library operations and objects in your
                  workspace
  )edit         : edit a file
  )frame        : manage interpreter workspaces
  )history      : manage aspects of interactive session
  )library      : introduce new constructors
  )lisp         : evaluate a LISP expression
  )read         : execute AXIOM commands from a file
  )savesystem   : save LISP image to a file
  )set          : view and set system variables
  )show         : show constructor information
  )spool        : log input and output to a file
  )synonym      : define an abbreviation for system commands
  )system       : issue shell commands
  )trace        : trace execution of functions
  )undo         : restore workspace to earlier state
  )what         : search for various things by name

------

I find the )what, )show and )display commands especially useful. 
But unfortunately in the current versions of Axiom )help is not
so helpful. :-(

I think Hyperdoc is sort of neat, but I have to admit I learnt
everything I know about Axiom without using it at all. Other
people have different opinions about it.

Yes, there should be. But Axiom is now a volunteer-based open
source project, so if there is going to be this sort of
documentation it will have to be written by these volunteers. 
Part of the implied obligation of using open source software is
the user's willingness to eventually "give something back" but
contributing in some manner to the project. Writing new and
improving old documentation is one way that new users can easily
contribute while they are learning Axiom at the same time. 

The Axiom Wiki

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org

is an especially easy way to contribute to this process.

+1. I agree 100%. 

Thank you for your comments.

You are quite right.

Your best bet for examples is, I guess, to look into the Axiom Book by Jenks
and Sutor. It has many examples and comes with the distribution, or online:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/Mirrors?go=/public/book2.pdf&it=Axiom+Book

Waldek: I didn't find the book in wh-sandbox? How come?

I found "definingPolynomial" on page 359, Section 8.3 "Manipulating Symbolic
Roots of a Polynomial." using the search facility of my pdf viewer.

Since this is probably not the thing you had in mind, I looked for "finite
field", and found that section 8.11 is the right place. Thus,

F ==> FiniteField(2,12)
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> definingPolynomial()$F

         12    3
   (2)  ?   + ?  + 1
                                Type: SparseUnivariatePolynomial PrimeField 2
should be what you want.

I do agree however, that the examples of the book should be integrated into
HyperDoc. This should not be too difficult, only, it has not been done (yet).
There is a short tutorial within HyperDoc on how to write new pages: Reference
- HyperDoc. RECLOS has an example page, RECLOS.ht in hypertex/pages shows how
to do it.

If somebody has time, it would be great to make the various sections of the
book example pages in HyperDoc. I think that Waldek is the one who knows how to
do it properly.

Waldek: RECLOS.ht says at the beginning:

% Copyright The Numerical Algorithms Group Limited 1992-94. All rights reserved.
% !! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE BY HAND !! Created by ht.awk.

So, which one is the source file?

I think you are quite right. For me, personally, the inversion of a matrix is
quite a neat example why axiom could succeed in teaching.


All the best, and PLEASE don't give up,

Martin

There is also an emacs interface as a maple sheet.

And I can send you an other emacs mode which allows several lines commands, 
with the syntax of input files.

Have a nice day !

It was playing around with finite fields which got me to investigate Axiom
in the first place.  Here are a few questions, arising from this input:

(1) -> F16:=FiniteField(2,4)

   (1)  FiniteField(2,4)
                                                                 Type:
Domain
(2) -> random()$F16

          3     2
   (2)  %A  + %A  + 1
                                                       Type:
FiniteField(2,4)
(3) -> definingPolynomial()$F16

         4
   (3)  ?  + ? + 1
                                Type: SparseUnivariatePolynomial PrimeField
2


All well and good, but

- how to I get output in terms of a nice variable (say x) rather than "?"
and "%A"?

- is there any way of forcing a particular defining polynomial?  (This is
good for working through examples.)

Thanks,
Alasdair

   (1)  FiniteField(2,4)
                                                                 Type: Domain

         4
   (2)  x  + x + 1

this one I do not know (currently), since

(10) -> p := random()$F16

           3     2
   (10)  %A  + %A  + 1
                                                       Type: FiniteField(2,4)

is *not* a polynomial. It's an element of FiniteField(2,4). But maybe you like:

(12) -> minimalPolynomial(p).x

          4    3
   (12)  x  + x  + 1
                                            Type: Fraction Polynomial Integer

(It would be rather easy to modify the output of FiniteField wo use something
else as output, but I don't think this would make sense)

Is this what FiniteFieldExtensionByPolynomial is for? I guess one would have to
do a little maths here. I'll look into it today afternoon.

Just to explore Axiom a little further, I was trying to do a Lagrange
interpolation on two lists:

LagrangeInterpolation([1,2,3],[4,5,-6])

This doesn't work - I get an error message which I (as a beginner) don't
understand.  So then:

1)  How do I do this?
2)  Without asking this mail group, where can I find this information in a
manner which I can understand?

Thanks yet again,

Alasdair,

Thanks for the question!

This is what I get:

(1) -> LagrangeInterpolation([1,2,3],[4,5,-6])
   There are no exposed library operations named LagrangeInterpolation
      but there is one unexposed operation with that name. Use HyperDoc
      Browse or issue
                      )display op LagrangeInterpolation
      to learn more about the available operation.

   Cannot find a definition or applicable library operation named
      LagrangeInterpolation with argument type(s)
                            List PositiveInteger
                                List Integer

      Perhaps you should use "@" to indicate the required return type,
      or "$" to specify which version of the function you need.


> So then:

> 1)  How do I do this?

I recommend first of all using the suggested command:

(1) -> )display op LagrangeInterpolation

There is one unexposed function called LagrangeInterpolation :
   [1] (List D3,List D3) -> D1 from PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms(
            D3,D1)
            if D3 has FIELD and D1 has UPOLYC D3

Hmmm.... what should I assume about what you can understand?
That is a difficult problem and the answer will change over
time.

With the above information you should be able to see that
at least that:

- the LagrangeInterpolation function does exist in Axiom
  but it is "not exposed"
- that it expects two lists as arguments
- and these lists must consist of elements of a Field
- and that it will return a polynomial over this Field
- and finally that what you passed as arguments to this
  function did not meet these requirements.

The first thing I would try is to look in the Axiom book by
using the search function in your PDF reader. No luck. But
at least you should be able to read there about what the phrase
"not exposed" means. Essentially it means that you must call
the function explicitly from the package where it is defined.

The second thing you might try is to look this function up
in HyperDoc using Browse, enter the name LagrangeInterpolation
and click Operations. Unfortunately this only tells you what
you know already plus the fact that it is "not documented
yet"...

You should also ask Axiom about 'PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms'

(1) -> )show PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms
 PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms(F: Field,P: UnivariatePolynomialCategory
F)
is a package constructor
 Abbreviation for PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms is PINTERPA
 This constructor is not exposed in this frame.
 Issue )edit c:/Program
Files/axiom/mnt/windows/../../src/algebra/PINTERPA.spad
to see algebra source code for PINTERPA

------------------------------- Operations --------------------------------
 LagrangeInterpolation : (List F,List F) -> P

So now take another look at the last point and what you
actually passed to the function:

                            List PositiveInteger
                                List Integer

So Axiom thought the first list [1,2,3] was a list of
PositiveInteger and the second list [4,5,-6] was a list of
Integer. Lets ask Axiom if these are Fields:

(1) -> PositiveInteger has Field

   (1)  false
                                          Type: Boolean


(2) -> Integer has Field

   (2)  false
                                          Type: Boolean

but at least

(3) -> Fraction Integer has Field

   (3)  true
                                          Type: Boolean

Oh! So how can I tell Axiom that these numbers are actually
from some Field? Try this:

(4) -> [1,2,3]::List Fraction Integer

   (4)  [1,2,3]
                               Type: List Fraction Integer

Ok, now lets try LagrangeInterpolation again:

(9) -> A:=[1,2,3]::List Fraction Integer

   (9)  [1,2,3]
                                 Type: List Fraction Integer

(10) -> B:=[4,5,-6]::List Fraction Integer

   (10)  [4,5,- 6]
                                 Type: List Fraction Integer

But how does one call the specific package where this function
is located? The command ')show PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms'
gave use this information:

 PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms(F: Field,P: UnivariatePolynomialCategory
F)

So now in my example above the Field is 'Fraction Integer' but it
may not be entirely obvious to you what

 UnivariatePolynomialCategory F

means. To make a long story short: Axiom groups it's mathematical
domains (types) into groups called "Category". This is almost (but
not quite) like a category in mathematics. Anyway let me suggest
one such domain that will work for us: The univariate polynomials
over the variable x with coefficients in the same field:

  UnivariatePolynomial(x,Fraction Integer)

so the final result looks like this:

(11) ->
LagrangeInterpolation(A,B)$PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms(Fraction
Integer,UnivariatePolynomial(x,Fraction Integer))

             2
   (11)  - 6x  + 19x - 9
                            Type: UnivariatePolynomial(x,Fraction Integer)

There, that was easy! Right? ;) Well, perhaps not for the
beginner...

As you get a little more experienced with Axiom you might look
in Axiom's source code itself. In principle this source code is
supposed to consist of both code and the complete documentation
of the code. here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra

This is a searchable online copy of the source code for the
entire Axiom Library. Enter 'LagrangeInterpolation' in the
search box at the top right of the page, hit enter and you will
see all the places where LagrangeInterpolation is used in the
code. Usually there is also at least some minimal documentation
included in the code, but in this case we are out of luck - the
original Axiom developer did not even leave us any hints. The
best we get is a quite readable algorithm written in SPAD -
the Axiom library high level programming language.

        LagrangeInterpolation(lx, ly) ==
            #lx ^= #ly =>
                error "Different number of points and values."
            ip: P := 0
            for xi in lx for yi in ly for i in 0.. repeat
                pp: P := 1
                xp: F := 1
                for xj in lx for j in 0.. | i ^= j repeat
                    pp := pp * (monomial(1,1) - monomial(xj,0))
                    xp := xp * (xi - xj)
                ip := ip + (yi/xp) * pp
            ip

---------

Which I think is actually quite readable, but perhaps too much
for the beginner.

Another important place to look online is the Axiom Input test
files. There are a lot of useful (but sparsely documented)
examples here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/input

But searching for 'LagrangeInterpolation' here we are again
out of luck.

---------

I am sorry that this email reply has gotten rather long, but
I wanted to illustrate the kind of help that I wish that one
day will be available on the Axiom Wiki and other Axiom
publications.

If you have any questions or comments about this please
continue.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear Alasdair, Dear Vadim!

Vadim: sorry I haven't sent you the paper by Gemignani yet. It turned out t=
hat
I do not have a pdf. If you are still interested, please send me a postal
adress and I send you a collection of papers today.  See below on a tiny
demonstration what FFFG can do.

If you do not want to ask on axiom-mail, you should ask on axiom-math. :-)

Seriously, I think the best and most rapid source of information is=20

axiom-math or axiom-mail for "how do I do interpolation, symmetric function=
s,
                              limits, plot graphs, etc."

axiom-developer for "why doesn't axiom compile on my machine" and "I have a
                     week spare time, and I'm sooo bored, what shall I do".

I'd advise you to spend roughly fifteen minutes=20

* browsing HyperDoc,=20

* using )what things interpol

* searching the pdf version of the book

* searching the mail archives and the wiki

If you are not successful, send mail.

interpolation:

Lagrange interpolation as implemented in Axiom is fine for toy demonstratio=
ns.
But if you are interested in interpolation in general, I suggest that you u=
se
my implementation of Bernhard Beckermann and George Labahn's FFFG (Fast
Fraction Free Gaussian) elimination algorithm. It is faster in exact domains
and much more general.  The same file also features (in a separate package)
polynomial interpolation using Newton, albeit in an extremely specialised
setting:

      ++ \spad{newton}(l) returns the interpolating polynomial for the valu=
es
      ++ l, where the x-coordinates are assumed to be [1,2,3,...,n] and the
      ++ coefficients of the interpolating polynomial are known to be in the
      ++ domain F. I.e., it is a very streamlined version for a special cas=
e of
      ++ interpolation.=20

You will have to install my package manually though, or use wh-sandbox. Here
are the docstrings:

    interpolate: (List Fraction D, List Fraction D, NonNegativeInteger)=20
                -> Fraction SUP D
      ++ \spad{interpolate(xlist, ylist, deg} returns the rational function=
 with
      ++ numerator degree \spad{deg} that interpolates the given points usi=
ng
      ++ fraction free arithmetic.

    generalInterpolation: (List D, CoeffAction,=20
                           Vector V, List NonNegativeInteger) -> Matrix SUP=
 D
      ++ \spad{generalInterpolation(C, CA, f, eta)} performs Hermite-Pade
      ++ approximation using the given action CA of polynomials on the elem=
ents
      ++ of f. The result is guaranteed to be correct up to order
      ++ |eta|-1. Given that eta is a "normal" point, the degrees on the
      ++ diagonal are given by eta. The degrees of column i are in this case
      ++ eta + e.i - [1,1,...,1], where the degree of zero is -1.
      ++
      ++ The first argument C is the list of coefficients c_{k,k} in the=20
      ++ expansion <x^k> z g(x) =3D sum_{i=3D0}^k c_{k,i} <x^i> g(x).
      ++
      ++ The second argument, CA(k, l, f), should return the coefficient of=
 x^k
      ++ in z^l f(x).


So, polynomial interpolation is interpolate([1,2,3],[4,5,-6], 3), Hermite-P=
ade
is, for example

The last line demonstrates that we have indeed found a solution to the given
(Hermite-Pad=C3=A9) interpolation problem. For example, let [c1, c2, c3] be=
 the
first column of M, then

ord(c1*f + c2 * D f + c3 * D D f) >=3D 4.


Note that, although seemingly different, interpolate and generalInterpolati=
on
use exactly the same algorithm, with slightly different parameters.


Possible future project:  I have implemented several interpolation algorith=
ms,
each useful in it's setting.  It would be good to design a general user
interface, that is more natural than I currently have.  Unfortunately, I do=
 not
have the time...

Second project: implement Peter Olver's ideas about multivariate interpolat=

I am not entirely sure I agree with Martin that this code is
"very poorly done". Perhaps that is true, from the point of view
of the Axiom interpreter because it requires that the user
provide some additional information - the type for the underlying
field. But given that, the interpreter is pretty smart about
deciding on the types. It is actually much easier than my
previous reply might have suggested:

(1) -> )expose PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms
   PolynomialInterpolationAlgorithms is now explicitly exposed
   in frame initial

(2) -> LagrangeInterpolation([1,2,3],[4,5,-6])@SUP(FRAC INT)

            2
   (3)  - 6?  + 19? - 9
              Type: SparseUnivariatePolynomial Fraction Integer

The critical part the interpreter was missing was just the choice
of field. But without a good knowledge of the Axiom type system
this solution would probably be rather hard for a beginner to
anticipate.

I would like to give you an unsolicited caution regarding the
use of pattern matching rules in Axiom. Although the application
of rules work fairly well within the Axiom 'Expression' domain
really this sort of symbolic manipulation of expressions is
rather foreign and unnatural in Axiom.

People who program in Python have invented a name of the
style of programming that is "natural" in that language, i.e.
"pythonic" (sic). In Axiom we can identify an analogous style
that we might call "Axiomic" or maybe "Axiomatic". :-) The
point being that most things in Axiom are done in an object-
oriented, algebraic manner -- and not by the simple manipulation
of expressions. As a long time user of Maple, Maxima and other
"symbol-oriented" systems, I think the hardest part about
learning to use Axiom for me was to understand this change in
paradigm. Most beginning users of Axiom think of types as just
"getting in the way", but in the end that is really where the
strength of Axiom actually lies.

One thing that the object-orientation buys you (and maybe
costs you) is the importance of understanding the existing
Axiom library (which currently contains nearly 1,300 different
abstract mathematical and data types. To get the greatest
advantage and do the least amount of programming it is
essential that you think about how what you intend to write
"fits" into the existing mathematical hierarchy. This means
more time spent up front analysing and generalizing your
algorithm but ultimately less time actually programming.

In your case perhaps you need to think about how the z-transform
relates to other integral transforms that already exist in Axiom.
For example:

(5) -> )wh package transform
-------------------------------- Packages -------------------

Packages with names matching patterns:
     transform

 INVLAPLA InverseLaplaceTransform      LAPLACE  LaplaceTransform

(5) -> )sh LAPLACE
 LaplaceTransform(R: Join(EuclideanDomain,OrderedSet,CharacteristicZero,
 RetractableTo Integer,LinearlyExplicitRingOver Integer),
 F: Join(TranscendentalFunctionCategory,PrimitiveFunctionCategory,
 AlgebraicallyClosedFunctionSpace R))
 is a package constructor
 Abbreviation for LaplaceTransform is LAPLACE
 This constructor is exposed in this frame.
 Issue )edit c:/Program
Files/axiom/mnt/windows/../../src/algebra/LAPLACE.spad
 to see algebra source code for LAPLACE

------------------------------- Operations --------------------
 laplace : (F,Symbol,Symbol) -> F

(5) -> laplace(x+1,x,y)

        y + 1
   (5)  -----
           2
          y
                                       Type: Expression Integer

------

Of course understanding what goes into the definition of the
LaplaceTransform package:

  EuclideanDomain
  OrderedSet
  CharacteristicZero,
  RetractableTo Integer
  LinearlyExplicitRingOver Integer
  TranscendentalFunctionCategory
  PrimitiveFunctionCategory
  AlgebraicallyClosedFunctionSpace

might require a significant effort. But it seems to me that in
order to write an Axiomatic z-transform package, one should be
concerned about the discrete analogues for the above domains.
This will likely have something in common with combinatorial
mathematics that is already in Axiom, e.g.

(7) -> )sh CombinatorialFunction
 CombinatorialFunction(R: Join(OrderedSet,IntegralDomain),
 F: FunctionSpace R)
 is a package constructor
 Abbreviation for CombinatorialFunction is COMBF
 This constructor is not exposed in this frame.
 Issue )edit c:/Program =
Files/axiom/mnt/windows/../../src/algebra/COMBF.spad
 to see algebra source code for COMBF

------------------------------- Operations =

 ?**? : (F,F) -> F                     belong? : BasicOperator -> =
Boolean
 binomial : (F,F) -> F                 factorial : F -> F
 factorials : F -> F                   factorials : (F,Symbol) -> F
 iibinom : List F -> F                 iidprod : List F -> F
 iidsum : List F -> F                  iifact : F -> F
 iiperm : List F -> F                  iipow : List F -> F
 ipow : List F -> F                    permutation : (F,F) -> F
 product : (F,Symbol) -> F             summation : (F,Symbol) -> F
 operator : BasicOperator -> BasicOperator
 product : (F,SegmentBinding F) -> F
 summation : (F,SegmentBinding F) -> F

But I hope that this does not discourage you from attempting
re-implement your Maxim z-transform code in Axiom. I really
only intend these comments as a kind of advanced warning of
where you might end up. It is entirely possible that you may
find the approach of using pattern matching rules to manipulate
Expressions adequate for your initial purposes.

I agree with Martin that making SumIt available in Axiom would be
a big step towards making it possible to write your z-transform
function in a more Axiomatic way.

Although pattern matching and rule-based algorithms *may* not be the best way
to program for axiom (and I'm not even sure about that), I believe meanwhile
that writing some programs in the scripting language will give you a very fast
start into axiom.

Rules to build book we broken some time ago.  As of revision 515 making
dvi should also (with the rest of documentation) build dvi version of the
Axiom book.  ATM rules to build pdf version are unimplemented.

In Nag version there is a common source for .ht and corresponding
parts of the Axiom book.  It should be relatively easy to just
restore Nag build process (but it would requre some work to merge
back Tim's changes to the book).  But I am not sure if we want
to do things in a way Nag did them, so I am still thinking about
best way of organizing documentation.  And, since I am busy with
other things it takes time.

I think if there is any system to extend with similar goals as SymPy
has, then it's SAGE. And I am definitely going to integrate SymPy into
it at some point. SAGE goal is to have something usable now. SymPy's
goal is to have something simple in python.

Yes, SAGE is getting there. I actually didn't beleive that Maxima
could be made callable from python (I mean more deeply integrated than
just passing strings around), but aparently, as the newest sage 2.5
shows, it is possible.

As I understand it what they wanted to say and also what I think is
that Maple's language is a mess if I say it directly. But I don't want
to go into any flamewars about languages. It's just my opinion, that
it's so much easier to program in Python (or even in C++) than in
Maple.

Yes, I also don't agree with them in this. For me the purpose of the
CAS is to do the same things that I would do by hand, but faster, thus
allowing me to be more productive.

That is remarkable, there is no question about that. I was meaning
just a simple calculus for "masses". As every code on the web that I
know of took a little different approach.

I am aware of only the codes that are listed in the links on the
SymPy's webpage:

http://code.google.com/p/sympy/

And when I last measured the number of lines of code (with ginac,
giac, axiom and some others), SymPy was by far the smallest. So I
think novel is that the calculus for masses doesn't have to be
thousands of lines of code and many years of development in many
people. Also that 7 classes are enough to represent everything (in
calculus for masses) also I think shows, that (at least the calculus)
can be done quite simply.

I know that my judgement about this can be wrong. But for me
personally the criteria are - number of developers of the language,
number of people using the language, number of different fields, where
the language is applied to (like web, physics, system administration,
etc.), how difficult it is to learn the language to fully understand
all it's syntax, how many libraries are written for that language. So
according to my criteria, the winners are (unordered), C, C++, Python,
Java, maybe also C#, Ruby. But I understand that there are other
criteria as well.

I am not in argument here. For SymPy's goals and my criteria for
languages however, the Python is better.

Yes, that is remarkable.

By reinventing the wheel I mean doing something again, when I could
instead take a working peace of code for my problem. I don't think
there is any other way of achieving SymPy's goal (except the SAGE's
way).

I think it is possible. I believe that the most important part of
mathematics, that is used in physics, that is needed to understand any
graduate book on general relativity, quantum field theory or
statistical physics can indeed be learned by anyone (I am not talking
about understanding the physics, just the formulas - what they mean
and how to calculate with them). And I think the CASes now are
becoming a standard tool present on any system, like the programs for
solving large sparse/dense matrices.
