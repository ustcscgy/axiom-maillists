*,

We have a major "business" opportunity in the near future.
(No, this isn't spam but it sure starts out that way :-) )

RedHat is changing its distribution model so that they maintain less
of a distribution and accept more packages directly from the developers.
I'm unfamiliar with the details of this change but it gives us a chance
to reach a larger audience.

We need to make a coordinated effort to identify and contact the major
Linux distributors (at least RehHat, SUSE, Debian, etc) to 

(a) understand their policy for "accepting and blessing" a package
(b) understand their requirements for pacakging (rpm, apt, etc)
(c) understand their config requirements
(d) understand their user interface requirements
(e) understand their support requirements

we need to "market" to them that they have a "hole" in their "product
line" in that they do not have an industrial strength scientific
computation system. We need to explain that Mathematica, Maple, MuPAD,
etc. are widely used and that Axiom can be a free alternative.

It is still early in our "product cycle" but a stand-alone algebra build
is frightenly close to reality and the rest of the system is targeted
to be built by year end. At which point the first, major effort will be
completed. 

We need to find "distributors" and RedHat's changing business model is
a major opportunity. 

Is there anyone on the list who is interested in "taking the lead" 
in the "marketing" department and coordinating "vendor" contacts?
It would involve emailing, cold-calling, and coordinating vendors to
gather the above "market requirements" and then making a plan with
the vendors to coordinate becoming part of their distribution. It is
essential that we find the right people to talk to within each 
distributor, that we work closely with them to feed their requirements
to the developers, and that they generally have a positive and professional
experience when working with us.

I understand that the prevailing "business model" of open source projects
is "build it and they will come". I want to change that to "build it and
deliver it to everyone's desktop". Yes, I know not everyone needs it but
having just one major vendor like RedHat or SUSE would put us in every
school and business worlwide.

The personal advantage to you is that you get a list of contacts within
the major vendors. You could leverage this to represent other open source
products with the same model.

I will, unfortunately, be only partially available until Aug 10th, as
I'll be at a conference. So your "classwork" assignment is to discuss
this among yourselves and volunteer to set something up.

Hello Tim,

As far as Debian is concerned...

> (a) understand their policy for "accepting and blessing" a package

... you need to be an official Debian Developer (a long and not so easy
process)...

> (b) understand their requirements for pacakging (rpm, apt, etc)

> (d) understand their user interface requirements
> (e) understand their support requirements

... and, for (b) to (e), follow the Debian Policy Manual:
  http://www.fr.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ 

That's said, for Debian there are two alternatives:

 1. Camm is an official debian developer, so he might be willing to
    package Axiom
 
 2. A friend of mine wants to make a debian package so he /might/ be
    interested in packaging Axiom. Of course, once made, the package
    will have to be "blessed" by an official debian developer. It's up
    to him now to decide if he wants to do it or no.

I personally think that explaining what is Axiom, compared to
Mathematica & Co., is the role of the main page of the Axiom website
(with screenshots, binaries, ...). We will have to present tutorials,
papers, etc.

I have stored all the references posted by Bill Page and links posted by
Jason White. That might be a good start for a web page.

By the way, friend of mine in Gulliver (the local Linux User Group here
in Rennes) and I are willing to provide Axiom's binaries for x86,
PowerPC and Linux-Sparc64.

I still do believe that "build it and they will come" is the right think
to do. Of course, we can ease the process by providing pre-build
packages. But I think that developers from major and minor linux
distribution will come if we can show the capabilities of Axiom.


Sorry to be so negative towards your initial proposal.

Best regards,
d.

I was planning on submitting/maintaining the Debian pakcage of axiom
when its released.  I'm already a Debian developer.  I maintain gcl,
maxima, and acl2 for Debian already.

Bertfried,

Thank you very much for your comments on Bourbaki and your
support for the idea of continuing to attempt to associate
the name "Bourbaki" with AXIOM.

I will be in Paris for the week of 14 to 24 September for
a physics conference and a short vacation (Avignon). Do you
think it would be useful to attempt to meet with someone in
Paris and vicinity to discuss and promote the association
of Bourbaki with AXIOM?

I agree. Though AXIOM is not exactly category theory.
Indeed AXIOM (and the Aldor language) seems to predate
most of the current interest in category theory in computer
science in the same way that Bourbakism predates category
theory itself. For example

  http://pauillac.inria.fr/caml/

  http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/Research/charity/home.html

etc. And meanwhile category theory is now almost taken
for granted in much of mathematics and advanced
mathematical physics. I think the task of "preserving"
(and reviving?) AXIOM that Tim Daly is leading is very
important. AXIOM is still in many ways ahead of it's
time as Saul Youssef points out

I am not too optimistic that such an 'official'
sanction is possible. After all, there really is still
a large conceptual gap between the pure mathematicians
and computer scientists. But I do not agree with the
recent comments by Arthur Norman:

> I know that nothing I do is in their league!

First, I think the goals of AXIOM certainly were/are
pretentious - just as pretentious as the young
Bourbaki's. In it's own context, one might also argue
that AXIOM was about equally successful in meeting it's
original goals. I don't think there is anything wrong
with that. The application and enhancement of AXIOM as
a computer algebra system deserves to continue in much
the same way as Bourbakism survives today.

About Bourbaki being "French". Also, I do not see any
problem with this. AXIOM is now open source. And in
many respects open source is strongest outside the
influence of corporate North America. I am still amazed
at the truly international flavour of almost all current
open source / free software projects.

Finally although humility is admirable, I disagree with
you Norman, when you say that that what you do is "not
in their league". Lisp, Reduce, Axiom many other projects
in which you have been involved are all enormous
intellectual achievements as far as I am concerned.
There is a sense in which mathematics done by computer
is harder (and much less forgiving) than any other
kind of mathematics!

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Here is private response made by Tim's Daly (Axiom lead developer) on
the previous request:

Tim Daly:
Axiom is still in alpha development. It was released as open source
in September 2002. However, the released code contained no build
system and was missing pieces that were not released. I'm in the
process of writing the build system and the missing pieces.

Axiom is being built in alpha form on a private server at the moment.
You can get the sources from

cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@bogus.example.com:/home/cvs co axiom

Work is being done to port Axiom to windows. You can see the current
state by looking at the axiom-developer email logs at the home site
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom

Axiom will sources will be available on the home site in the near
future. There is no point in putting them there yet as Axiom isn't
ready to be useful yet. Once the algebra compiles cleanly and passes
the test suite it will be available on savannah.

Tim Daly
axiom@tenkan.org

I hope it answers your questions.
Best regards,
d.

Dr Salvy, Dr Meunier,

I just returned from ISSAC where your paper on the Encyclopedia
of Special Functions was presented.

I'm the lead developer of Axiom which has recently become free and
open source software.

I'm involved in an effort called CATS (Computer Algebra Test Suite).
We are collecting test suites from the various computer algebra
systems, classifying the tests, and building a taxonomy from these
tests. The rational is that each computer algebra system has a random
collection of tests. These are usually created by the author of an
algorithm at the time the algorithm is written. These tests are rerun
to provide regression testing. The key flaw is that these tests are
almost never validated. There are a large number of computer algebra
systems and a limited number of computational mathematicians and we
have every incentive to share the expertise to improve the systems.

The ultimate goal is to have a taxonomy of validated tests organized
similar to the GAMS classification. GAMS is too numeric-specific to be
useful for the range of symbolic software functionality. Special
functions are only one area where current systems need testing.

We've been looking at various collections of mathematics, including
DLMF, and are interested in electronic forms of examples to use as
test cases. Note that CATS is intended as testing material, not
as user-level examples. We expect that an independent, standardized
test suite will raise the overall quality of the current computer
algebra system results.

Are your test cases for the algolib library available? 

I think there is an overlap of interests between the CATS effort and
the Algolib effort even though CATS is intended for internal use and
Algolib is intended for the end user. In particular, it would be
valuable if all of the current systems provided the same answers.  Is
there a person on your project who is willing to be the principal
contact between your effort and ours? Could you forward this message
to that person?

Many thanks,

Tim Daly

    I seem to recall having read that the commercial
version of Axiom contained a complete implementation
of Risch's algorithm for computing integrals in terms
of elementary functions. 

    The marketing blurb would then boast that if Axiom
is not able to return an integral in closed form in
terms of such functions then it has effectively proved
that such an integral does not exist.

    This raises two questions:

    1) Was that assertion a truthful one, or just a
marketing ploy?

    2) If it was true, is such code available in the
open source version?

No, it wasn't a mareting ploy. Barry Trager's thesis
contains a "decision procedure" for these integrals.
It either returns an answer or the original integral
there is no integral. Failure to return an answer
implies that the integral does not exist. This code
is implemented. (Barry Marshall Trager, 
Integration of Algebraic Functions, Ph.D Thesis 1984
MIT EECS dept.)

Manuel Bronstein did the same for elementary functions 
(Manuel Bronstein "Integration of Elementary Functions"
Ph.D. thesis 1987 UC Berkeley ).

All cases of the Risch algorithm are not coded however.
Manual has worked on several cases, I believe the
transcendental cases, from time to time.

The source code is available as part of the open source
version of Axiom. The thesis work will be integrated as
part of the documentation of these domains when time
permits.

David,

I might as well bore you with my long-term thoughts about pamphlets.

If you do the ADVI browser think of it as the front end to a new kind
of automated book. The browser is intended as a viewer for the dvi
files generated from pamphlets. (Ideally the browser would handle the
dvi generation from the pamphlets but you can assume that's been done)
But the pile of pamphlets will eventually provide an N-dimensional
matrix of information. We want to support at least 7 different views
off the same data in this big pamphlet matrix:

View 1 is a top-to-bottom path. At the top you start with a technical
paper that provides the mathematical description. For example, looking
at the area of integration starting with Barry Trager's Ph.D. thesis.
>From there you eventually work your way down to executable code. Thus
you move from theory to practice.

View 2 is a side-to-side path. Here you are staying at the same level
of abstraction. You would be exploring, for example, all of the matrix
capabilities provided by Axiom by looking at the mathematics of each one.
Or looking at the implementation of each one.

View 3, unlike View 1 and 2 which remain within the text area of the 
pamphlet files, would wander among the code area of the files, say, 
finding the pamphlet which contains the source code of a function 
called from the current pamphlet.

View 4 is a "threaded walk". ADVI allows embedded graphics and active
terminals. View 4 is intended to allow professors to develop course-related
paths thru the pamphlets.  A particular course, say commutative algebra,
could develop a "textbook" which visits subsections of pamphlet files
in a particular order. This would also be used to construct further
pamphlet files. These will also contain embeded active graphics for
explaining things in class.

View 5 is a "slide show" kind of presentation intended for classroom
or lecture use. This would visit code, pop up graphics and active
windows (hence use ADVI), etc so you could give a lecture using Axiom
within the slides.

View 6 follows "document structure" information such as following 
bibligraphic references to other pamphlets or combining index information
for cross-reference purposes. In general the browser will end up doing
searches (e.g. looking for the pamphlet containing a function for View 3)
and caching the results (e.g. building a file-based hashtable of 
function->pamphlet cross-references).

View 7 is a "concept map" form. This is the hardest to do as it
requires input from the user to construct. There is technology
available from the early 90s called KREP (Eric Mays's Knowledge
Representation) which, combined with OPS5 (Charles Forgy's thesis work
on rule based programming) forms a system called KROPS (my research
work at IBM). KROPS is a ( concept graph / rule graph ) that 
automatically classifies "concepts" based on subsumption. It "learns" 
as you add concepts to the graph. The long term use of this in Axiom 
is intended to support the ability to "shape" the pamphlet files matrix 
based on the understanding of the user of the system.  

There will be a large amount of mathematics in the pamphlet pile. We
need to control the complexity. So the idea is to watch what the user
visits and "learn" what he already knows. This gets added to a
"concept graph".  The "concept graph" of a linear algebra professor
would differ greatly from the concept graph of a group theory
professor. This learned information feeds rules to drive the
presentation of information. Note that this functionality is "a long
way off". However you can see that the "30 year view" of Axiom's
mathematics is somewhat beyond what is available today (but barely
uses the technology available in the 1990s. sigh).

So, in general, the pamphlet file is not intended to be a monolithic object.
It is rather a sequence of chunks, subsections, and references that can be
visited and recombined at will.

There needs to be some sort of a "construction" support which will record
visited or needed links into some sort of a tree structure. Think of it as
a method of dynamically constructing a book by ripping out sections of
other books, adding your own notes, and combining them to form another
booklet. It's the "big staple" method of construction. Take a bunch of
existing subsections and chunks and "staple" them together. This is
different from the standard "back button history" trace because you 
indicate things you want to keep and re-arrange. Ideally this would "save"
as a booklet file format for later hand-editing. Using this mechanism
authors can build on previous work and professors can construct class
notes from existing work.

Initially I don't expect any of these views to be supported. All we need
in the beginning is some sort of a book-like front end. The "top level"
file will just be a pamphlet file that is a table-of-contents containing
"pamphlet" chunks using the "booklet" function you created:

This is the first chapter
<<pamphlet:src/doc/first.pamphlet>>
This is the second chapter
<<dvi:src/doc/second.dvi>>
...

I laid out the various views to give you some idea of the needed
generality in the long term.

*,

Axiom exists as free and open source software.

The first version of the Axiom sources has been uploaded to the CVS at
http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/axiom. Congrats to all involved.
Many thanks to the Numerical Algorithms Group, the CAISS Institute at
City College of New York and to the people of these mailing lists.

This version contains (almost) all of the algebra, the interpreter,
and the spad compiler. This is the heart of Axiom. The graphics,
hyperdoc, documentation, numerical code, Axiom Journal papers,
openmath, and CATS test suite are in my source tree but are not ready
for distribution yet. I'll announce these parts as they become
available.

A gzipped-tar file of the sources will be available soon.
Debian apt and Redhat rpm files are under discussion.

The CVS version can be downloaded by anonymous CVS:

cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/savannah login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@subversions.gnu.org:/cvsroot/savannah co axiom

NOTE: when prompted for a password for anoncvs simply press the Enter key

The primary documentation is in the Makefile.dvi file.

To build the system in a directory (e.g. /SPAD) you do:

cd /SPAD
export AXIOM=/SPAD/mnt/linux
make

The executable is (currently) found by doing:

export PATH=/SPAD/obj/linux/bin:/SPAD/mnt/linux/bin:$PATH
interpsys

The build takes about 2 hours and 15 minutes on a 2Ghz/1Gb machine.
You might want to do the build in an emacs shell buffer so you can
save the console output in case of trouble.

So far the build works properly on Redhat GNU/Linux 9. If you build it
on another system please let us know. A port to Windows is in process.

This is an alpha version of the system so expect (and report) bugs.
The savannah website has a bug reporting tool.

The algebra runs but has not yet been tested. This version has been
uploaded so we can all test from the same base. When reporting bugs
please use this version number printed at the top of your Axiom session.
It will look something like:
  Thursday, August 28, 2003, 2:31am

This version is a complete rebuild of Axiom. Many changes have been made.

First, the system has been rewritten using literate programming.
Each file is in "pamphlet" format (which is basically Latex with
two extra tags). The reason for this is explained in the top-level
Makefile.dvi file.

Second, the system has been ported to GCL. This is the first of many
common lisp ports where Axiom will exist.

Third, the makefile tree has been rewritten. Most of the documentation
that exists at the moment is in the various Makefile.dvi files.

Fourth, the algebra is built from scratch rather than pre-existing files.

The tenkan.org website and CVS is now obsolete and will be removed. 
Please use savannah for future development.

Much work needs to be done. Click on the homepage link to see some of
the future tasks.

Questions, comments, and snide remarks can be sent to me at:

Congrats on the release!  A very impressive achievement.

One question - is the file axiom/zips/XFree86-devel-4.2.0-72.i386.rpm
needed in the cvs tree?  Wouldn't that be something the distro would
provide?  

Thanks much for all your tremendous work.

Well, it appears that the CVS commands that I copied from the 
documentation on Savannah do not work. I'll figure it out and
post new instructions. There is no such thing as a simple job.

Only the CVSROOT was wrong. It should be:

Tim,

On my first attempt to compile the new Axiom source from Savannah
I got the following error message:

Is there a problem with 'autoload/apply'??

Bill,

The autoload path is correct so that isn't the problem.
The AHYP compile is the first .spad compile so this is the first
time that the new Axiom started.
So it seems that apply.boot did not compile.
Check your console output for the apply.boot compile and see why it failed.

Tim,

Here is what I see for apply.boot in the build log. It
seems to have compiled normally. Any other ideas? Are
there any environment variables besides AXIOM that might
affect this?

Tim,

The odd thing is this: I just returned to my 'projects/axiom'
directory and typed 'make' again. Now it seems to be able to
find apply and the compile continues...

Right now I can't explain this. I haven't changed anything
since the first attempt. I did not start from 'make clean'
however. I just tried to reproduce the error by having make
carrying on where it left off. But it didn't work - or rather
it *is* now working, unexpectedly.

Anyway, I let you know in a couple of hours if it completes
properly.

Cheers,
Bill page.

I'm unable to figure this one out. Perhaps we should talk on the phone and
we can look over the details.

I've set up a new mailing list, axiom-math@nongnu.org, for the purpose
of discussing mathematical and philosophical issues with Axiom. The
developer's mailing list is intended for more specific coding and
debugging tasks.

Tim,

The url

  http://mail.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-math

Gives the message:

Not Found
The requested URL /archive/html/axiom-math was not found on this server.

Perhsps the list is not yet fully set up?

I think your idea of creating this list is a good one!

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I feel a bit stupid.

I tried 
cvs -d:pserver:anoncvs@bogus.example.com:/cvsroot/axiom login
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anoncvs@bogus.example.com:/cvsroot/axiom co axiom

and got the answer:
Unknown host bogus.example.com
(twice)

What's wrong?

Best regards.
