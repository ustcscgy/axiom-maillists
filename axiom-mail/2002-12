If you're interested in proving the correctness of Axiom's algorithms
you should check out the work by Tom Kelsey and Martin Dunstan, both
former PhD students of Ursula Martin's at St Andrews.   They generated
Larch specifications of all the types in the Axiom library and actually
found some bugs as a result!  Tom still works at St Andrews and his home
page at http://kininvie.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~tom/ includes his thesis.
Martin is now working on the Scottish space programme in Dundee
(really!) but still has a home page at St Andrews,
http://www-theory.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~mnd/, which includes his thesis
(follow the "academic publications" link).

re: Proof thesis.

Many thanks.

I'm looking into the sorting algorithms used in the algebra.
I've found 4 types: explicit where the code exists 
under the name "sort", exports where the implementation is
inherited, embeded where the code exists inline and implicit
where the sorting occurs by construction (e.g. a new item is
always added "in order" at each function call).

I'm muttering and puzzling over ways to prove the 4 kinds.
Even the explicit case involves inherited functions from
other domains. There is no such thing as a simple job.

Tim

It occurs to me that while I'm doing this preliminary look at the
proof problem that I can attack Axiom's algorithms on the complexity
front with the same divide and conquer techniques. Once the sort
routines have been isolated and identified it should be possible to
look at their complexity especially since the complexity of sorts
has been well studied. This was triggered by the discovery of two
bubble-sort implementations in the system.

I also need to annotate the sorts with statements about the stability
of the sort. Which leads to the question of what other "properties"
could other algorithms have?

Yes, I've had email conversations with Stephen and we're both
committed to maintaining compatibility. I've recently asked Stephen
to become an Aldor developer because I need Aldor running on the
Palm-pilot class of machines. I'm willing to do the work to port
it to that style of platform (more likely the Zaurus but something
in the handheld form factor).

Yes, I'm the same Tim Daly, albeit a bit older and less wise. 
I wrote a tutorial for the Aldor compiler at one point in the
distant past.

You can find out the current status by visiting:
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom

Particular plans and directions are available at the "homepage" link:
http://www.nongnu.org/axiom

The source code is not yet posted there. We are using a different
server for alpha development to ensure that the posted code at least
compiles correctly before we go public. Hopefully the interpreter and
algebra will arrive by year-end. It depends on how many vacation days
I get as this is a nights-and-weekend project.

I've downloaded and (lightly) read your thesis. The techniques are
interesting. In order to understand where I'm coming from I guess you
have to have a little background on the current direction of Axiom.

Axiom's being rewritten into a literate programming style using
a variant of Knuth's Web program built by Ramsey, called noweb. We plan
to define a standard format for these documents which we term "pamphlets".
I see from the thesis that you are already familiar with literate programs.

Pamphlets are intended to bring together the various parts of a particular
domain or topic including embedded code, design documents, examples, 
test cases, user documentation, proof, references to other pamphlets, etc.

The key problem with a system like Axiom is that it is nearly impossible
to fully understand the naked code without being aware of the background
theory. Unfortunately, the theory tends to be written in a Ph.D. thesis
which gets enshrined in a library and completely disconnected from, indeed,
often not even referenced by the source code.

I've gotten permission from various authors to include their Ph.D. work
into pamphlet files. I've embedded the source code into the thesis along
with more detailed explanations tying the thesis sections directly to
the code. The noweb program can extract the code for compilation or
construct the documentation with the embedded source code.

In this way I'm bringing together work by various authors who have
used Axiom. I want to ensure that the research work is available to
future users. 

One of the current efforts (see the homepage link above) involves
proving Axiom's algorithms correct. While I realize that this is a
huge task that will probably take years of work by many people I
believe that it needs to be done.

As computer algebra systems get larger it becomes impossible to be
an expert in the many domains they cover. However, as you point out
in your thesis it is important to know the assumptions made by these
systems. Relying on the fact that the code was written by experts in
their respective domains becomes insufficient as the system gets 
larger. 

Because Axiom is theory-based and strongly typed it is easier to 
verify and validate such a system (which, does not imply that it is
EASY to do so). However, unlike other programs that you might try
to prove (such as a text editor) Axiom is reasonably close to the
mathematics it tries to use. This gives us an advantage in two
directions. First, we have an underlying theory to guide the proofs.
Second, we don't need to descend to modelling the underlying system.
 
We're looking to attack problems of verifying and validating Axiom
at several levels. Your work (and Kelsey's work) provide a good
formalism that we can adopt as a standard for annotating the algebra
source code. To that end I'd like to be able to use your thesis (in
a modified form) to produce a noweb pamphlet that would be included
with Axiom. I'd expect that the thesis work would be spread over
two pamphlets, one annotating the SortPackage with an expansion of
your notation for those sorts and a second annotating defaults.spad
where our quicksort implementation lives.

I think that the work you've done can be useful to developers and
users of the existing system. Tom's work on Catdef.spad would make
excellent documentation of the catdef hierarchy.

We have been in discussions with the nuprl, now MetaPRL, developers to
examine the use of their methods to provide formal verification. They
have tackled large systems in the past (e.g. the French air traffic
control system) and appear to have the machinery to at least make a
significant dent in the problem. This will take a few years, of course,
but I'm looking toward a 30 year horizon for Axiom so I'm not concerned.

In fact, I believe that the intersection of Mathematics and Computer
Science forms the field of Computer Mathematics where you'll be expected
to not only prove your theoretical result but also to reduce it to
practice in a proven form. That this area will someday be a recognized
department within Universities is inevitable.

I've already rewritten portions of a thesis into a pamphlet for the
domain of Denavitt-Hartenburg Matrices (dhmatrix.spad). I've had
discussions with Dr. Sit for doing the same with his research work in
partial differential equations (pleqn.spad).

I'm not particularly worried that the implementations are wrong. The key
concern is that the mathematics continues to move. In order to keep a
system like Axiom alive we need to make it possible to understand the
existing code so it can be modified by the next generation of Ph.D.
students.

Actually, I'd prefer a TeX form of the document provided you were willing
to let me rework it into a pamphlet form.

This is where I see Kelsey's thesis work being applied. He has done
work on catdef.spad which is the basis of the Category towers.

Kewl. I did masters work in machine vision and ended up doing industrial
robotics centuries ago. It's really a fun area. Of course you're working
with cameras that are slightly higher resolution than 32x32 pixels.

This is the problem with free software. You have to make it possible for
the next generation (which could mean NEXT YEAR) to pick it up and carry
it forward.

re: time. No problem. I'm looking for Axiom related work and am
expecting to do it myself or farm it out to the developers.

re: project. Actually, I don't. Can you give me a more specific pointer?

Hi!  Firstoff, thanks for all the work being done on Axiom.  It's truly
amazing.

I note in the task list that you are planning to migrate some plot
functionality to gnuplot.  I had a couple questions related to that,
and I apologize in advance if they are silly/not yet relevant.

First question:  Does Axiom intend to use the interactive rotation and
pm3d abilities of gnuplot on Windows? Last I heard (which was
admittedly a while ago) those abilities exited only on the X11 version,
and only in cvs.  An extension to Windows would be really neat.  (Well,
for Windows users anyway.)

Second question:  What precisely do you plan for the feedback featues,
or rather what gets fed back to the system?  I'm hoping this means if
one rotates a graph in gnuplot the computer algebra system knows about
the change in perspective, scale, etc.  The reason is that if one wants
to print out a document with a gnuplot graph in it, the program can
generate the postscript/pdf/image version of the graph as it appears
onscreen, rather than reverting to defalts.  In my version of gnuplot,
if you change the viewing direction in the X window, gnuplot doesn't
remember that when you close it, set terminal postscript, and generate
a file - it reverts back to the default view.  I don't know if the
gnuplot.lisp interface in clocc can handle this kind of stuff; maybe it
would help, but my guess is gnuplot would need to play along.  Is that
what you had in mind?

Third question:  Will it be possible at some point to embed gnuplot
windows into TeXmacs documents and have them be interactive?

Anyway, I'll stop annoying people now.  I realize this is probably not
on the radar screen for quite a while, but I thought I'd ask what the
long term plans were as far as Axiom and Gnuplot were concerned.

Thanks,
CY

Hi All,

	I have now had a close look at Aldor/Algebra (which was by the way
not so easy to get even working on my SuSE system). However, messed up
with my Maple experience, I have variouse problems in understanding the
philosophy behind the type systems and the organization of the
proceedures.

a) From a very modern point of category theory one has to go for a
function based setting. Stes are just special cases of objects in a
category. However, Aldor (Axiom?) is an imperative language, not a
functional one. Is there a chance to restrict the occurence of _objects_
to instances (at least in own programs)?

b) Are there Axiom programs available which one can analyse to learn how
to use the system? (Axiom programs dealing with mathematics, e.g. a
Groebner package, or something else) I do usually lern by stealing :) The
Aldor programs in the help/reference documentation are quite trivial...
but were instructive to see its doing what it should.

c) Could someone provide a list of reference application and put it on the
AXIOM web-site, this would be of tremendous help (for me :)

d) Is the algebra layer of AXIOM code already available? If so it is
readable by someone not pretty familiar with Aldor/Axiom language?
[By the way if I have to wait for the pamphlet files, this might take very
long, and Perhaps I could try to document some code during my trail to try
to nderstand it anyway?]

e) Is and Aldor program runable in Axiom (later)? In other words, if
I start to do something bigger in Aldor, can it be reused in Axiom
later (and vice versa)?

Any poiners to projects, programs, documentation is welcome.

Thanks for your time.
BF.

Tim, 

It sounds fascinating.  I'm delighted that Noweb might help enable
such an interesting and ambitious project.

Readers might be interested to know that Noweb supports documentation
in LaTeX, troff, HTML or plain text, so there is some flexibility on
the weaving side as well.

My opinion is that this would be easy to do using a Noweb filter.

For complex documents, we have wound up storing both `code' and `text'
in Noweb code chunks.  I have not explored clever ways of `weaving'
such documents.

Good luck!

I don't run windows so I really can't answer this question well.
I know the Axiom code, written by Scott Morrison, is capable of
a lot but we have no-one of Scott's ability to maintain it.

What I have in mind is that you can get information back from gnuplot
once the object has been manipulated. Ideally you'd like to be able to
display a 2 or 3 D equation, play with it for a while interactively
and get the results back. Initially this is likely to be just the data
you mention such as rotation angles and, possibly, the point data. 
However, for a really useful system you'd have a set of symbolic
parameters that the plot program knows about. Consider a reasonably
complex example such as a surface which is defined by control points.
As you drag the control points around you change the shape of the
surface. You'd like to be able to send a "model" of the surface which
has several parts: 
  (a) the initially plotted surface
  (b) the symbolic plotting equation
  (c) the control point data structure array
  (d) the eye, lighting, viewpoint, etc data structure
Changes to the displayed plot would be reflected in these parts and
the user could query the model at any time. 

Another interesting example would be to use the graphics subsystem
as an interactive tool to help in a calculation. For instance, 
suppose you had a root-finding program. The user could visually
indicate intervals of the real line where roots occur in the plot
which could be communicated back to the program in some sort of an
interval data structure (interval is a type Axiom currently supports).

More interesting cases occur if you try to study knots. You could
display knots, perform local transformations, return the results
(which would compute and display the knot polynomial). This 
cycle could continue as you interactively manipulate the knot.
If you manage to reduce the knot you could display the resulting
braid.

The key advantage to merging with gnuplot is that it is used by
several of the computer algebra systems and so everyone benefits
from the effort.

The key advantage of merging with any graphics program including
gnuplot is that the code will be maintained by somebody who understands
the subtle details of graphics.

The hard part of ripping it out of Axiom will be understanding the
correct API to make it useful and extensible which means we need a
fairly clever and insightful person to lead the whole subtask.

An alternative to exporting the code would be to make it much more
tightly bound to the Axiom library. If someone builds a "graphics
algebra" subtree within the algebra library I'd be much more in
favor of keeping the code embedded in Axiom. An knot algebra
subtree would be an interesting example.

Ummm, dunno. Clearly it is possible. I've sent off a request to 
Rudiger Gebaurer to try to recover an interactive textbook that
was done for Axiom. (I haven't heard back yet but I never did find
his direct address and sent the request thru company management.
If anyone has a contact please let me know).

Apparently IBM Research did an interactive textbook that allows you
to do interactive equation solving and graph manipulation in a
linear algebra textbook. It seems a shame to lose this technology
and I'm sure we can improve it if we can liberate the textbook.
It seems a shame to let this work go to waste and it would make
a great model for the "booklet" format I keep muttering about.

I'm the annoying one, especially if you don't agree with my random
pronouncements :-)

It won't come onto the radar until either a developer steps up 
and takes an interest in Axiom's plot program, a developer from
gnuplot steps up and wants to steal the code or I get to the code
and start chewing on it. But I'm willing to talk about it in the
mean time.

Axiom has a steep learning curve. It is worth the climb but you only
see that in hindsight. There is a project underway to explore the
use of a novel "zero-learning curve" interface.

All of the algebra source code comes with the system. You can read the
algebra code directly. Catdef.spad defines all of the categories and
is somewhat readable for the first few if you know what a Semigroup and
Monoid are.

In a standard NAG installation all of the algebra source code sits in
/usr/local/axiom/src/algebra. You could look at the dhmatrix.spad file
which defines Denavitt-Hartenburg matrices. These are 4x4 matrices for
translations and rotations. 

Also in a standard NAG installation all of the test code sits in
/usr/local/axiom/src/input. These are test cases for the algebra
code. Look at src/input/bouquet.spad. This defines some really
simple user level functions.

Reference applications? Aldor is the most likely candidate for reference
applications. Axiom isn't designed to embed in other applications.
Manuel Bronstein <www-sop.inria.fr/cafe/Manuel.Bronstein/libaldor> and
Niklaus Mannhart <www.int.ethz.ch/personal/mannhart>  have done some very
nice work with Aldor. Alternatively you can check out Aldor's home page
(www.aldor.org), in particular the projects link.

I've written an Aldor tutorial (www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap21.html) 
which will show you how to develop a simple polynomial data type in Aldor.
It is, I hope, a readable introduction.

Yes and no. The key difference (there are others) you will discover
is that the input/output syntax differs. Axiom uses a type called
OutputForm whereas Aldor uses C++ like syntax. One could, I suppose,
recreate OutputForm in Aldor. Check with Stephen Watt <Stephen.Watt@uwo.ca>
to see if such a thing exists already. If you are careful about the
isolation then writing portable programs is possible.

While the syntax and semantics of Aldor and Spad (Axiom's compiler
language) are very close they differ whenever platform issues arise.
It makes no sense to try to do standalone programs in Axiom. On the
other hand, Axiom has a huge library that Aldor lacks. If you are
trying to do research-level algorithms I'd certainly choose Axiom.
If you want to do stand-alone algorithms but want stronger typing
than you will find in Java, for instance, use Aldor.

I'm not at the point where I've had time to think about the details
of this yet but I'll look at filters (again). As you remember my
last attempt failed due to my lack of sed/awk/shell skills. This
time I'll try harder.

I've experimented with this. The problem is that chunking turns off
the TeX format mechanisms. This is the correct behavior for code but
not for the text. 

Further, I need two behaviors for text chunks. 

First, I need to be able to essentially \include a text chunk from
another document (or maybe a whole text root) into the current
document. This is to ensure that information that is widely needed is
not copied everywhere (otherwise some copies will be out of date).

I also need this ability in order to construct "booklets" without
copying the original sources but also without including the original
sources in total as \include would do. Think of a booklet as a thread
thru pamphlets with text along the threads. This will allow one to
write a chapter introduction, include some text and code chunks from
some pamphlet, and then write a summary or problems section (for a
textbook).

Second, I need to \cite a text chunk in a woven document. Then I
can cross-reference the documents so a reader mechanism can follow
the citations. This comes from pondering ideas of how to read the
.dvi files in some rational way. I'm tempted to automatically 
construct an html tree on top of the dvi files but I'm not happy
with this solution for the long term. The reader has to be more
intelligent and know about pamphlets, booklets and citations.

The current thought for a text chunk mechanism is, as you suggest,
to use the code chunking mechanism. That would make it simple to
understand for the user which is important. However, noweave would
have to get a whole lot smarter so it can reconstruct the document
from the chunks before trying to TeXify it. It also needs to
construct a bibliography environment (but with a different name)
so the \cite{chunk} mechanism works across pamphlets. Using this
information would be up to the reader program.

Tim, are these files generally available?

As it turns out, I do have these files from the old NAG
demo disk for which I do not have a usable current license
but I can at least read the code. Are you intending to
put them into cvs soon for others to read? Bertfried is
interested, would there be any licensing issues if I
were to send him (or anyone else who asks) a copy by
email attachment?

Yes, they are. In the new version they will be pamphlet files but you
are free to send the src/algebra and src/input files if you like.
Except for examples I've already done or plan to do the algebra
pamphlet files will just be wrappers around the code when they first
get posted.

Ideally, we will all work to track down the primary research references
behind the code, contact the authors and get permission to quote heavily
from the sources (or, better yet, convince them to help with the effort)
and write pamphlet files that explain the algebra.

In fact, I'll wrap these up soon and post them on tenkan.

Dr. Watt,

I am working with Tim Daly on the new open source version
of Axiom, specifically I have offered to produce a version
of Axiom that will run under Windows. To that end, I have
been investigating both Cygwin and MinGW/Msys as potential
platforms on which to build the windows version. There
are pros and cons for both: a version of GCL (one of the
Lisp platforms for Axiom) already exists that compiles
under Msys, but Msys lacks the ability to run x-windows
required to run the current version of TeXmacs which is
one possible GUI for Axiom.

In any case, because of the relationship between Axiom
and Aldor, I am also very interested in a version of Aldor
that would run under Windows. Has any work been done on
such a version of Aldor? If so, is there any way that I
might help to make this generally available? Testing? Etc.
If not, I would be quite interested in initiating such a
project. The goal, of course would be to make Aldor
available both as a stand alone compiler under Windows
and also as the library compiler for the Windows version
of Axiom.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hello,

While toiling with details of cr/lf in Windows versus
Linux, I have continued to ponder the longer term issue of
an appropriate graphical mathematical notation for open
source Axiom. Given the enormous amount of effort that
is currently devoted to a modern replacement for LaTex
in the form of MathML and OpenMath and in spite of the
still overwhelmingly prevalent use of LaTex, I think it
would be prudent to consider incorporating such a new
approach into Axiom soon after the availability of simle
character interface. It seems that work in this direction
is already quite advanced. See for example the paper by
Stephane Dalmas, Marc Gaetano and Stephen Watt:

  http://www.orcca.on.ca/~watt/papers/i97omath.pdf

An OpenMath 1.0 Implementation

Abstract

The first official version of the OpenMath specification was
released in December. This paper presents the first imple-
mentation of this standard, in the form of a C library. To
ensure a faithful realization, a second, independent imple-
mentation with the same api was built using Aldor (A#)...

---------

See more about OpenMath at

  http://www.openmath.org/cocoon/openmath/index.html

Note in particular:

  http://www.openmath.org/cocoon/openmath/software/index.html

"A phrasebook for AXIOM 2.3 <http://www.nag.co.uk/>was
shipped with the system"

---------

And here is an excellent introduction to both OpenMath
and MathML by O. Caprotti and D. Carlisle 

  http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds6-2/openmath.html

OpenMath and MathML:
Semantic Mark Up for Mathematics 

Abstract

Unambiguous representation of mathematics is crucial for
communications among humans or among computer systems.
OpenMath is a standard aimed at supporting a semantically
rich interchange of mathematics among varied computational
software tools such as computer algebra systems, theorem
provers, and tools for visualizing or editing mathematical
text. MathML is a W3C Recommendation for the encoding of
mathematics `on the web' which also includes mechanisms for
encoding mathematical semantics. We introduce each of these
two languages and describe their relationships. 

---------

Finally, to ask a direct question: I was wondering what
level of support/encouragement for doing something with
open source Axiom and OpenMath among the potential
Axiom volunteer developers? I think Tim Daly has already
(more or less) cast his vote in favor of doing the text
interface first (of course) and then a LaTex-oriented
interface for graphical output along the lines of the
old NAG techexplorer GUI. Right Tim? What do other people
here think?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Could Axiom use a C implimentation of such a library, or would it need
a lisp version?

My personal opinion, for what it's worth, is that openmath is indeed
worth supporting, but it is not yet mature enough to justify a massive
push to use it first.

I have some slight confusion here - my understanding was that OpenMath
wasn't interface related so much as it is a tool for communication
between different systems.  If your question is GUI work vs.
communication work, I'd most definitely say GUI first.  Presentation
MathML as an output format makes a lot of sense to support, since it
is/will be a standard for math display in modern browsers, but
otherwise I'd say wait on inter-system communication issues until Axiom
itself is a reasonably stable, functioning package with a decent GUI. 
This is more or less the approach the Maxima project is taking, so I
admit I'm biased.  I guess it depends on what the potential user base
desires.

There is a libw11 project on sourceforge which tries to work around
this, but Dan Stanger looked at it for the Garnet lisp interface and
found it had too many limitations and it hasn't released an update in
quite some time.  I'd be surprised if it worked for TeXmacs, but maybe
it would be a starting point?

The other major option is to make TeXmacs work directly with the
Windows GUI, which is not a nice thought.  One thing is likely, though
- if people have to install and run cygwin and X in order to run Axiom,
that could seriously limit the user base on Windows.  For Axiom's
target audience it may not matter much, though - that I don't know. 
Since I can't make either work I don't really get a say in any case,
just thought I'd rase the points.

My take is that OpenMath is the semantic layer between
a program (e.g. Axiom) and the presentation layer *or*
another program. Of course one need not separately define
such a semantic layer if the goal is only presentation.
But the OpenMath content dictionaries already exist which
map between OpenMath and LaTex or OpenMath and MathML. In
this direction it is mostly a matter of "forgetting" some
of the semantics. And there are maps to several other
programs. If one implements this intermediate semantic
layer, than their are a lot of (potential) options
available.

Since Maxima is also an open source project, it seems
appropriate to discuss it a little here. What more can
you say about the current Maxima approach?

Obvious problems:

(1) copyright. 

This would be especially delicate when the text chunk produces source
that would be published, say, not within the open-source or Axiom
journal, but outside these.

(2) technical. 

There has to be some very restrictive convention on text chunks that is
TeX/LaTeX source (and similarly for other types of source that supports
any macros). For example, if within a text chunk, \renewcommand\xxx{...}
is allowed, then when other text chunks are assembled, the assembler
will need to be smart enough to save the the current definition of xxx
before getting into that chunk and restore it afterwards -- but this may
create problems too, because the original intention of the chunk author
may be that \renewcommand\xxx{...} has a larger scope than the text
chunk. The problem does not exist for the author, because the author
knows and presumably verify the assembled output. But when the text
chunk is \include(d) by other authors, it will be like calling a
subroutine with global variables reset as side-effect. Other commands
involving defining any macro are equally problematic.

One solution may be to limit the scope of macros local to the text
chunk, if the text chunk is intended for reuse. But how does the text
assembler know the previous environment without being the TeX compiler?
(Perhaps there is a TeX command to query the definitions of a particular
macro? I am no TeX/LaTeX expert, but as we will see, this facility will
be very useful. Let's call this the macroResolver for now. Such a
program is not too difficult to write for TeX gurus.)

How would code chunk assemblers solve this problem? In Axiom, we are
allowed to define macros (say, textual string substitutions with ==>,
not to mention the == ). So again we need an equivalent macrResolver.

Citation can presumably be done by creating a protocol that identifies
the location of the source. So the problem is defining what "location"
is, perhaps in a similar way to URL. But there is more. You are not
contemplating on just citing a DOCUMENT, but a TEXT CHUNK, that is the
equivalent of chapter and verse citation. So each citable text chunk
must have its own "URL" (let say we call it UCL, for chunk locator). If
you are using .dvi as the source (because you want to avoid compiling
the source again), you will need to embed the UCL info into the .dvi
source, which requires modifying TeX (not an elegant solution). The html
tree construct would work for entire DOCUMENT citation because the
entire .dvi file is retrieved and displayed. The user must then manually
scroll to find the right place. Not every .dvi (or .ps) viewer supports
searching. A .pdf version would be easier as far as the user goes since
(a) we don't have to maintain Acrobat Reader (b) it has good searching
facilities.

  However, this is not a good solution.

  Returning to the text chunk citation problem, it would seem that the
logical place for the booklet reader to obtain the information would be
the booklet/pamphlet source. Then the assemblers need to have an option
of outputing only the portion of the text chunk. This is probably
do-able. (For TeX, the assembler will have to create on the fly a TeX
source that can resolve all the user-created macros appearing in the
text chunk using the macroResolver. (As we see later, this is not
enough, we also need a labelResolver, and worst, a symbolResolver, but
let's ignore that for now). For code, a similar thing has to be done
when macros are used.) So a possible scenario is:

booklet 1:
...
(a)=some tag that identifies the type of chunk for that particular
assembler
... some chunk 
(b)=some tag that identifies that this is the beginning of a citable
portion
(c)=some tag that identifies an external name for this citable chunk,
say the name is BIBITEM
(d)=citable portion of chunk 
(e)= some tag that identifies that this is the end of a citable chunk
... more chunk
(f)=some tag that identifies the end of the chunk

booklet 2:
...
(z)=some tag that cites a chunk using BIBITEM
...

When the assembler (for the type of chunk) compiles booklet 1 the normal
way, it creates in a citation database an entry in the form of a pair
(BIBITEM, UCL). The UCL contains information on the name of the booklet,
the pamphlet containing the chunk, the type of chunk (a), and the tags
(b) and (c). The BIBITEM is published and used by other booklets for
citation.

When the assembler (for the type of chunk) compiles booklet 2 the normal
way, it outputs a citation in the form of [BIBITEM] say.

When a user wants to open this [BIBITEM] while reading booklet 2, and
say clicks on it, the booklet reader spawns a process that, in order,
 
(1) searches the citation database for the UCL corresponding to the
BIBITEM.

(2) finds out from the UCL the type of chunk BIBITEM is and invokes the
associated assembler by giving the source booklet file, pamplet, and the
tags (b), (c). The assembler resolves all the macros within the citable
portion using macroResolver, sends an abbreviated source that just
includes the citable chunk with all macros resolved to the TeX compiler
if the type is TeX, which outputs a .dvi and sends it to the booklet
reader for rendering (printer/screen). If the citable chunk is code,
then the abbreviated source can be sent to the booklet reader directly,
or to a code-formatter first.

The same mechanism may be used for references in TeX (this is not to be
confused with citations: a reference \ref{label} is a pointer to a
labeled location within the document, such as a Theorem, an equation,
section, etc; a citation \cite{bibitem} is a pointer to something
external to the document).  A labelResolver can resolve the references
easily using .aux, so a reference within a citable chunk can be compiled
correctly. It would be desirable and it is possible to add the
convenience to be able to jump to a labeled point in a pop-up window
(wouldn't that save us all the page turning back and forth?) if we treat
certain references (labeled items) as citable.  The processing of
citable chunks needs to be modified to handle labels external to, but
referenced within, the chunks.

But resolving the labels is only to maintain the same display as the
original document of the cited chunks. The definitions of symbols within
the cited chunks are not available, usually. (A symbol is any
mathematical symbol typset in math-mode). The same is true for a
referenced equation or theorem. Even if we can jump to the reference the
way a citation does by making it citable, the referenced or cited item
is not useful if the symbols are meaningless. This is probably the
hardest to resolve, for a TeX document, unlike a code source, the
symbols are not identified at all. There seems to be no way to write any
symbolResolver for TeX without revolutionizing the way math papers are
typeset.

So I leave you with an open problem, and readers of booklets will still
have to scroll and search manually the meaning of symbols. 

We can severely restrict how a citable chunk or reference can be written
-- they need be self-contained.

Renaud,

I don't know if you've been following the latest email threads
from the new Axiom website (savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom).
However, I'm working on the open source version of the system
now that it has been released from NAG.

A major change that I'm working on is to convert the whole system
to use a literate programming style. In order to do this for some
domains in the algebra code I've been trying to find the primary
theory sources for the algebra code. I am trying to construct some
example domains so that other developers and future contributors
can submit source code embedded in a literate document.

I just saw you mention reclos.spad on sci.math.symbolic.
Can you point me at a reference for the reclos.spad code? 
I'd like to track down the author and get permission to use
quotes from the papers in the literate document for that domain.

Tim

OK.  So you're thinking if Axiom goes ahead and uses OpenMath

Before I start, please remember that I am not the Maxima project leader
or really even a significant developer as of this point.  I have done
some documentation work and hope to do more, but I am not a coder.  I
will probably try to be come one for the GUI part of the project, but
that isn't here and now.  So take what I say with a grain of salt,
since I am not an authoratitive voice and many of these points are in
line for intense debate in future Maxima mailing list discussions. 

Maxima is a system which is a bit different from Axiom in its purpose. 
Different developers probably have different visions of what it will
become, but my take on it is that Maxima will aim in the long term to
become to the open source community what Mathematica and Maple are to
the commercial one - a powerful and friendly system with a low learning
curve interface, but with more capabilities if one wants to take the
time to learn.  It doesn't have Axiom's strong typing or literate
programming style, but will likely be substantially easier to use for
non-experts.

That said, our game plan is to work on fixing the code and
documentation until we can produce a release which fixes all known
mathematical bugs in the code.  Once that is achieved, and the
documentation is brought up to a reasonable standard, we will look at
adding a decent GUI, improving plotting and the possibility of
integrating some specific pieces such as pari and the GNU Scientific
Libraries.  Those tasks are a long way in the future, and will most
likely be the subject of much debate, but if I had to guess I don't
think we will be in a hurry to impliment OpenMath, with the exception
of presentation MathML output for web publishing.  We are more likely
to identify specific components we want or need and work to tightly
integrate them into the system, either through foreign function
interfaces or perhaps reimplimenting some smaller pieces directly into
lisp.

These long term goals are not hardened yet, obviously, and may change
as we continue to work on Maxima.  But I think it's pretty clear that
the we aren't going to use OpenMath for an interface, and a GUI is
going to be a higher priority than OpenMath. IIRC even if we were
wanting to use it I think there are some significant conflicts between
the OpenMath standard and Maxima's syntax.  

As to the GUI itself, no definite plans have been formed yet.  We are
putting off discussing that until after all the code cleanup and
bugfixing are done to the point where we can do a stable release,
mostly to stay focused.  That's a hot topic, and last time it came up
we must have had 40 emails on the subject in a couple days.  I'll
summarize a few highlights of the old discussion, but remember I was
one of the ones in the discussion so I'm not a neutral third party.

1.  Any GUI solution needs to be Cross Platform.  
   This at least everyone agrees on.  Axiom also does, so nothing more
need be said about that.  The trick is how.

2.  The current interface (Xmaxima, a TCl application) will need to be
totally replaced.
     This is mostly agreed upon, although some new work has made
Xmaxima more tolerable.  It just isn't flexible enough, and can't
display formatted mathematics.  Not strictly related to Axiom, since
TeXmacs seems to be the popular choice as an interface.  (With good
reason - Maxima has a TeXmacs interface too, and it is currently the
nicest one available.  That interface will be maintained and expanded,
but I think we feel that we need the flexibility of a very tightly
integrated interface.)

3.  There are many toolkit choices, and it is not immediately clear
which is the best choice to impliment new work with.

    This was where most of our discussion centered.  Among the choices
proposed were FLTK, WxWindows, GTK, and implimenting a native Lisp
interface.  For plotting there is Gnuplot, plplot, implimenting a
solution using the VTK toolkit, the Gtk plotting tools of Scigraphica,
and possibly even resurrecting or reimplimenting the old IZIC plotting
package, which had an interface to Maxima.  For plotting the solution
is not necessarily unique = we already can use more than one plotting
package.  We will likely need to pick one as the "official" solution
and make sure it works well, but that doesn't necessarily exclude
people integrating others.  The choice of toolkit, however, is a
limiting choice.  It will decide much of what we can do, or rather how
easily we can do it.  (Of course people can impliment others, but we
don't have the resources to make all the parts work with multiple
toolkits.)  Some of the pros and cons of each:

FLTK - small, lightweight, cross platform.  However, the language
doesn't have a native look on each platform and would have to be
integrated with lisp code in maxima.  Solution for Math display would
need to be developed.

WxWindows - very large feature set, cross platform.  Has the native
look and feel of the platform it is compiled for.  Very large, however,
and has the same problem as far as talking to maxima.  Also needs a
solution for math display.

GTK - cross platform.  Would allow use of scigraphica tools.  Possible
use of GthMathView for display of mathematics.  Problems are the look
is rather foreign to Windows users, would require the installation or
inclusion of Gtk for Windows, which I believe is rather large.  Also
has  the problem of communicating with lisp - no mature native
bindings, although a few do exist.

native Lisp interface - potentially cross platform, would need work. 
Possible specific toolkits are Garnet, currently the most promising in
the cross platform department, and McCLIM.  The drawbacks are that the
look and feel will be Unix unless a look and feel is created for each
platform. (Possible in Garnet but likely a lot of work.)  A math
display solution would need to be created.  In Garnet's case we would
effectively be maintining the toolkit ourselves.  The enormous
advantage, however, is that Maxima could communicate directly with this
interface - they would be in effect one program.  No bindings are
needed.  Internal maxima code for intelligently displaying equations
could be used much more easily with such an interface.  There is also
the advantage that once the interface is written, lisp is a very stable
target language and major rewriting will most likely not need to happen
to stay current with library versions. (Gtk1.2->2.0, KDE1-2-3 are
examples.) At most the clx and other low level interfaces might need to
be updated to handle changes in newer versions of core graphic systems.
 

I personally favor using a native Lisp toolkit.  I should note that in
choosing between Garnet and McCLIM there are the following issues to
consider:  1) Garnet is more feature complete.  2)  Garnet is showing a
good chance of being able to run on Windows, thanks to truly amazing
work by Dan Stanger.  3) McCLIM uses the CLOS (common lisp object
system) while Garnet has it's own solution.  4) CLIM is the closest
thing in the Lisp world to a GUI standard.  

McCLIM could in theory be made to work on Windows, but no work is
currently being done on the front.  Also, Maxima itself makes little
use of CLOS, so Garnet's lack of it isn't a killer issue for us, if we
decide to go that way. I anticipate a lively discussion on the Maxima
list in the future.

Anyway I'm sure that's way more than you wanted, and if you are using
TeXmacs then you won't be interested in the pros and cons of various
toolkits.  I don't know if a native lisp interface for Axiom would make
sense or not, even if you wanted to develop one.  But I though I'd
outline where things stand.

The latest sources and the underlying CCL lisp contain support
for OpenMath (search the CVS tree sources for "OpenMath"). I'm
not sure how complete the support is at the moment. Mike Dewar
probably knows.

Well, first I've obtained permission for the various documents I'm
using (though motivated more by respect for the author than the legal
issue). Second, most of the quoted text will come from other pamphlets.
Third, publication outside of Axiom raises the issue of BSD licensing
of text of which I have no opinion as I've come to understand that Law
is at least as complex as programming and only experts should play.
Fourth, in the spirit of science it seems that the whole benefit is to
have others learn from and use your results. Fifth, copyrights haven't
been a huge benefit to the original authors (in my experience) as they
end up signing away those rights just to get published anyway. Sixth,
the subject is so complex that one can only depend on the cooperation
of the members of the community. Seventh, if some event DOES cause a
problem the only reasonable response is to withdraw the text and
apologize. Eighth, a large portion of this work is done by people
around the world so it raises the issue of international copyrights,
an even more arcane subject. Ninth, there seems to be great advantage
to having your Axiom-related research work distributed with Axiom and
that IS the point of publishing, right?

Unless we get a few lawyers on this mailing list who have qualified
opinions I don't see the point of discussing the legal issues. Yes,
I know it is important but without some authoritative opinion we're
just having "angels-on-pinheads" debates. I've read 4 books on the
subject of intellectual property, been advised by a lawyer over
intellectual property issues related to employment and read the
debates on open-free-proprietary. My only conclusion is that we have
to leave this subject to the people with law degrees.

So all I can suggest is: ask permission then proceed.

Yes, this would be a problem. However, you can change any of the 
pamphlets or booklets and submit the changes to CVS. Thus, it is
possible to dance around the issue by changing the referred-to
document to eliminate the problem. It does raise the issue of
"debugging" your document. sigh.

The process generates:
 
   pamphlet -> tex -> dvi

I expect that the "source" will be the pamphlet file.
In some instances it might need to be the tex file but we should
probably figure out clever ways to avoid this. The dvi file (or
ps or pdf or html or whatever final target gets chosen) is a
"compiled" form. However, TeXmacs could probably do some fancy 
things with almost any level assuming someone is willing to write
the code.

Hopefully the final "reader" (quite possibly TeXmacs or some other new
open source tool) will handle the problems you raise. I've been pondering
them for a while but don't have any grand insights to share. It's all in
the requirements-gathering phase, of which you've raised a few, at the
moment.

Thanks for the references. I'll look at them this weekend.

Yes, I have the code for version 1. I'll update the code to use Version 2
if you'll put it someplace or send it to me. I've already received a couple
fixes to the algebra tree that will be distributed with the next version.

I've signed you up for both the axiom-mail@nongnu.org and the
axiom-developer@nongnu.org mailing lists. The archives for these
mailing lists can be reached from the website. 

Since you haven't been on the mailing lists you will have missed my
discussions of literate programming and Axiom. I'm modifying the whole
system to use a literate programming style. All of the files in the
distribution will be "pamphlets" or "booklets". 

The literate programming idea comes from Knuth and Dijkstra. Knuth
generated a language called Web which takes a "literate document"
and has two functions, tangle and weave. Tangle generates code, 
weave generates tex thus:

   Literate Document
                     -> tangle -> pascal code 
                     -> weave  -> .tex file

Norman Ramsey has noweb which is not language specific so the process is:

   Literate Document
                     -> notangle -> any code 
                     -> noweave  -> .tex file

A pamphlet is a file is basically a tex document with a couple extra
tags to mark the "code chunks". Basically you write the tex document
and when you want to introduce code you wrap it with:
<<(some string)>>=
   your source code
@

These code chunks are extracted by notangle. 

In the new Axiom all of the makefile, C, lisp, boot, input and algebra
files are now (or will shortly be) in pamphlet form. Thus reclos.spad
will now be reclos.spad.pamphlet and the makefile will do:

   reclos.spad.pamphlet
                     -> notangle -> reclos.spad -> compile
                     -> noweave  -> reclos.tex  -> reclos.dvi

At the present time the reclos.pamphlet file contains only the source code
so the reclos.tex file also only contains the source code. What I'd like to 
do is use the original documents to explain the code. 

The motivation for this is that the theory is currently enshrined in a 
library and the code is in the running system. In order for the next
generation of people to be able to understand, maintain and update the
algebra code we need to bring these two things together. So the idea
is to embed the original tex documents into the reclos.spad.pamphlet
file along with the code, modify and rewrite the document so that the
gap between the theory and the code is covered and add the resulting
pamphlet to the system. I'd like to see this happen with reclos.spad.
In order to do that I'd need your permission (and review) to use your
papers in the documentation of the code. Is this possible?

Booklets, mentioned above, are a meta-level to pamphlets. The idea
is that a booklet represents either a horizontal slice of the system
(e.g. all matrix functions) or a vertical slice (e.g. integration from
top to bottom). Booklets would also be useful for teaching (e.g.
linear algebra). 

Even more interesting is that I've found out that IBM Research did an
interactive textbook based on Axiom. Commercially this would be dead,
of course. I've been trying to contact Rudiger Gebauer, who, I've been
told, was the publishers contact with IBM. I'm hoping that they would
be willing to open source the textbook which would give the whole
community a great benefit. We'd have a good textbook and a working
first try at interactive textbooks. I'm sure that the CAS community
can take it even further given the chance.

You've been added to both lists. OSCAS isn't Axiom specific so I've 
tried to limit my cross-postings on that list. On the other hand, OSCAS
has been dormant for a few months and I'm not sure what the current state
of the community is. There was talk at one point of adopting Axiom but
I've heard no further discussion on the subject. I tried to contact
Gilles Khan but email to his address bounced. Has he left his position?

> By the way, could you advance on a Bill Shelter award ?

Nothing much has taken place on the Schelter award. I did nominate
Bill for the Free Software Foundation award. I had a discussion with
Richard Stallman about the potential to combine the FSF award and
the Schelter award idea. It seems reasonable to me but I'm not sure
if everyone associated with the FSF award would agree. In any case,
it looks like I'm going to end up putting up my own cash in order
to fund the award. I'd also need to get committee volunteers so the
award could be decided and the cash distributed by someone other than me.
Depending on my financial circumstances I've been looking at offering
a $500US award at IJCAI next year. Other than that there is no progress
to report.

Well, I've read Fateman's objections and I tend to agree with him.
I don't see how a system like Axiom can send a complex type, say
List(Polynomial(Fraction(Integer))) to another system and get the
same type back. This is an important issue for Axiom as most of the
semantics of an expression depend on the type. Most of the other
computer algebra systems can't handle Axiom's complex type towers so 
I don't expect OpenMath or MathML to do it any time soon.

We're looking into using a Magnus-type of front end which has a
near-zero learning curve. It offers a completely different way of
thinking about the system than any other interface I've ever seen.
The casual user should find it easy to learn. I expect that the
more sophisticated user will want command-line or TeXmacs.

if the Maxima people document their algorithms sufficiently well
we could stea...ummm, share them :-)

Since we both use Lisp as a base (indeed, GCL is a shared common lisp
base) we could, in principle, define the semantics of operations by
sending lambda expressions as well as syntax embedded in the
stream. Even in this case it is not clear what Maxima would do with
Axiom's type information.

One of the key reasons I've been pushing "command line" as the first
interface is that it works everywhere. I agree that it is primitive.

GCL has a tcl connection. We're not exploiting it but I see the code
there. I'm not in a great hurry to invent something specific. We did
that once with hypertex (we had hyperlinking before browsers were big)
and it was great at the time. Now it just looks primitive.

If TeXmacs can grow to support pamphlet and booklets, can be driven
from Axiom as a "display control", can embed graphics, etc and works
cross-platform I think that it will be sufficient for our needs.
Hopefully the TeXmacs crowd will give us a good API from automation
as well as a good editor. Having done graphics all the way from
setting registers on hardware display chips to Java 3D I'd much
rather someone else figure it all out.

Yes, we actually also have a similar division of users - there are the
advanced users like Dr. Fateman who prefer the power of the programming
language, and then there are wimps like me who prefer GUIs.  That's why
we've never really considered trying to build an interface that fits
all purposes - it really doesn't work.  Emacs is usually our interface
of choice for more powerful usage - you can do command line or use a
mode for putting maxima sessions into latex documents.  That's how our
Maxima Book is being written.

There are some very powerful algorighms, no question, but you'll
probably faint if you try to read our code.  Apparently when it was
written computers were so limited that commenting the code was
considered a poor use of space, and also encouraged users to change
(break) things.  Obviously things have changed considerably now, and it
is on our long term plan to document the code, but it is likely to be a
work of years and Dr. Fateman has said that for many parts of the code
it might be simpler to just rewrite it than figure out the old stuff. 
So if you can figure out the algorithms, we would be interested :-) 
 
One possibly useful tool I've been looking at is xref, which trys to
generate a map of what calles what within a lisp file.  It generates
alarmingly huge outputs, but I don't have a problem believing the code
is that complex.  I don't know if it would work for pamphlet files, or
even be useful, but in case you want to check it out...

Yes, I'm not sure quite how that would work.  Probably in the long run
it makes more sense for each system to learn from the other and
impliment whatever concepts are relevant in the context of their own
system - the different philosophy of the two programs is just too big a
complication.

Yes, command line needs to come first.

Well, I can't say I'm too worried about looking primitive (within
reason) as long as the system is easy to use.  Garnet allows custom
look and feel designs, so if someone really doesn't like an interface
implimented there they can redefine it. Old interfaces in the
literature still impliment innovative ideas, and I would be glad to use
them if they still worked/were available :-).  To me thats the more
major issue, whether the code can survive.  Lisp code seems to do
extraordinarily well in that department.  (Witness Maxima and Axiom. 
Also I downloaded Xref from the CMU archive, and as far as I know it
hasn't been maintained since the early ninties.  One trivial change and
I was able to run it on Clisp and CMUCL.  GCL has some problems I
haven't figured out yet.  That's a pretty good average.)

Can't blame you there.  I'm sure TeXmacs will be fine once it runs on
Windows  - it's a truly amazing piece of work.

The OpenMath connectivity in Axiom 2.3 was based on the latest version
of the INRIA C Library cited in the paper by Dalmas et al.  Since NAG
doesn't own that library and I was unsure of whether its license
conditions would be acceptable to the open source community I disabled
the code which linked with it in the version of CCL I sent to
Arthur/Tim.  The library itself is freely available from the link
http://www.openmath.org/cocoon/openmath/software/OMCv1.4a.tgz.

The support for translating Axiom to OpenMath (which doesn't depend on
the INRIA Library) wasn't extensive - we basically wanted to have the core
OpenMath content dictionaries supported but its not too hard to extend
that.  Going e.g. "OMwrite sin(x)" should return a string containing the
OpenMath encoding of sin(x).

We used to distribute both Axiom and Aldor on Windows - Axiom was
compiled with VC++ and Aldor (I think) worked with gcc as a back end.
To get a command-line version of Axiom going on Windows should be
straightforward if you have VC++ (and probably not too hard with gcc),
and shouldn't require cygwin.

I'm a bit surprised that there isn't a Windows version available from
aldor.org but there should be no major technical obstacles to producing
one. 

Cheers, Mike.

Thank you for this enquiry Bill, and response Mike. 

I have just returned from a working visit with a colleague in
France where we were shaking down a Windows version of Aldor.

There are still one or two rough edges to sort out, such as getting
Aldor object files to work in the Visual C++ debugging environment
etc etc, but these are relatively minor.   We should be putting a Windows
version up on the ALdor.org site shortly.  On the Cygwin/MinGW front,
I believe we have also a version which we can tidy up and put on the
web site.  Your interest in these versions

It is very good to learn of your interest in these versions and your
willingness to participate in making them available in these settings.
Would you like to become involved in the correspondence on these?

Yours,

Stephen Watt

That's good news.

A version of Aldor that is compatible with and which
compiles using MinGW would be very good. MinGW has been
rapidly moving away from Cygwin with the introduction of
their Msys development environment. There seems to be a
strong desire for an open source native Windows platform.
However nice it is to have around, the Cygwin Unix emulation
layer often seems to get in the way of true Windows
compatibility and interoperability. Also it seems that one
pays a rather large performance penalty when using the
Cygwin dll.

Yes, I would be happy if you could include my email address
in your exchange. If there is anything I might do to assist
with testing the Windows version(s), I would be glad to help.

Mike,

Yes, there appears to be a functional version of Aldor
(AXIOMXL?) in the compiler directory of the old NAG PC
demo Cdrom. It does not seem to be affected by the lack
of flex license.dat. But I will need a little more time
to experiment to see if it is really possible to use it
separately form Axiom itself.

Of course this version would be just for playing until
the Aldor site has their version available.

Regards,
Bill.

Tim, I am surprized! My reaction to Fateman's paper was
immediately negative and even after re-reading I still get
the impression that it is only a rather poorly executed
hatchet attempt. I suppose that to debate this here in the
Axiom mail list might be considered kind of coping out since
I know that there are supporters of OpenMath who read this,
but I have know idea whether Richard Fateman does. Perhaps
it has been argued in detail elsewhere, but what harm can
it do (except distract Tim from getting Axiom into a
publishable open source state... <grin>).

On

  http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/algebra.html

Richard Fateman writes about the above cited paper:

I am sure it was irritating but to suggest that it is merely
insufficiently analytical or technical strikes me as an
exaggeration. In most respects I think Fateman is simply
wrong and his didactic method also seems dubious. He makes
several gratuitous comparisons to, for example, software
reuse, Godel's incompleteness theorem and even Robert Jones'
utopianism. He states that "[OpenMath] does not have any
mandate outside the rather simple application of denoting
what could be trivially done in any programming language
capable of representing attributed trees". Under the
heading "Good and Bad Science" it seems to me that Fateman
illustrates exactly the kind of error of which he
implicitly accuses the OpenMath designers: "palpably false
[assumptions] that means that any possible results of the
investigation are totally disconnected from any possible
relationship with other mathematics or applications."

I suppose there are almost as many philosophies of
mathematics as there are mathematicians, but Fateman is
a computer scientist. Having been in the position in my
distant past of (unsuccessfully) defending a PhD thesis
proposal in front of an audience consisting of members of
the mathematics and computer science department who
habitually sat on opposite sides of the room in spite of
sharing the same floor of the same campus office tower,
I am acutely aware of the extremely polarized views of the
respective roles of those who feel they must include the
word science in their professional titles and those who do
not. So I feel a little "cheated" in this article by
Fateman - perhaps somewhat like how a feminist might feel
being put down by another woman who views her role
in society in more mundane and conventional terms.

It seems as if Fateman is promoting a philosophy that claims
that mathematics is inherently only a human endeavor that is
forever out of the grasp of mere mechanical systems. But
I have always favored a philosophy that is almost
diametrically opposed to this view. I find the
constructivist/intuitionist view of mathematics much more
compatible with the kind of engineering goals that are the
foundations of computer science. To that end, category
theory, and in particular the algebraic approach to set
theory, seem like a much more suitable starting point then
conventional logic and formal systems.

In my view it is precisely Axiom's success at presenting
an apparently complete and constructive type system
demonstrates the possibility of achieving at least some of
the goals of OpenMath. What OpenMath looks for is some kind
of universality. At a deep level computation universality
guarantees that any program in one language can be re-
written (simulated) in another but of course OpenMath wants
this universality to be expressed at a higher level than
that of the Turing Machine or recursive functions, or for
that matter LISP. So I don't think is an accident that
Axiom was one of the first mathematical software systems
which incorporated some of the OpenMath ideas.

Tim, I think you over state your case when you claim
that "other computer algebra systems can't handle Axiom's
complex type towers". I would not deny that a strongly
typed language such as that implemented by Axiom is more
expressive and more concise than an untyped language like
Maple. But there is nothing inherent in the design of
Maple's programming language that makes in impossible to
implement that same algorithms and data structures as
Axiom - it's just more work in Maple.

In any case, I would consider Axiom in a somewhat different
role. I think that you might agree that if someone where
to re-code an algorithm expressed in Maple into Axiom,
then the problem of re-coding this algorithm a second time
into for example Mathematica, is much simpler. In a sense,
the rigidity imposed by Axiom's type system formalizes a
larger part of the algorithm than is otherwise the case.
Or stated another way: there are few right ways to express
the algorithm in Axiom than in Maple or Mathematica.

So I see OpenMath as attempting to fill this role as a kind
of interlinga for mathematical software. To what extent it
can do that in it's current incarnation is an open question
as far as I am concerned. But I think the attempt is both
worthwhile and likely to be very productive in the long run.

--------

I am rather new to both sides of the argument, so I hope
that I have not badly mis-represent either position and if
I have I would be glad to be corrected.

Regards,
Bill Page.

In case I gave the impression that I think Richard Fateman
is wrong on all points in the above document, I want to
add that there *are* some things that he says that I do
agree with - it's just that these have little to do with
OpenMath. For example, in section 8 he talks about issues
of scope and binding: "The fact that binding, evaluation,
substitution and related concepts have been so mangled by
computer algebra systems (for example Maple and
Mathematica) should have served as object lessons to
OpenMath designers. Instead of standing on the shoulders
of those who have gone before, we are standing on their
toes.". I like that statement and I agree with it fully
having struggled with Maple's arcane evaluation rules
and variables bindings for almost 10 years. New versions
of Maple have done very little to improve the situation.
Axiom and Aldor on the other hand seem to have got it
right from the beginnning.

It is not clear to me, however how this relates to the
goals of OpenMath per se.

In section 9 he discusses new interfaces to computer
algebra systems based on HTTP and dynamic HTML
(e.g. CL-HTTP). Coupled with MathML, I think this approach
has a great deal of promise both as a local graphical
user interface and in remote access to computer algebra
systems via the web. Certainly given the current state of
Axiom's GUI, this should be seriously considered.

The problem of session variables and multi-threading in
systems designed for simultaneous remote access by many
users is a significant one. Even in the single user case,
the current worksheet/server interface provided by Maple,
for example, often leads to situations where the contents
of the worksheet does not reflect the state of the
calculation engine. This problem was solved many years
ago with the original spreadsheet programs so that changes
in one part of a worksheet automatically (or on demand)
resulted in the rest of the worksheet being updated.

With respect to improving web interfaces to computer
algebra systems Fateman writes: "I can not say for sure,
but I expect that OpenMath would not help.". I agree but
here again he seems to be simply attaching a strawman.

Finally, in his conclusion he writes: "Once some truly
significant program makes essential use of OpenMath - so
essential and with so remarkable a significance that many
other programs will speak OpenMath simply to use it - then
there is a chance of validating the ideas [of OpenMath]."
Perhaps open source Axiom could be this truly significant
program?

Bill Page.

Well, Fateman's a clever fellow and knows more about the subject
than you might suspect. Rather than try to defend him or his
positions I'll state my own thoughts on the subject of OpenMath.

>From what little I claim to know about the subject the fundamental
idea is that there are libraries of semantics that define what the
symbols used in a communication mean. That way the sender and
receiver have a common point of reference. I suppose this might
be possible but it would be a fundamentally hard problem.

Just to get down to cases lets assume that Maple, for example (and
I confess that it is years since I've actually used Maple so my
examples might no longer hold true) and Axiom. Let me try to 
illustrate why *I* believe the problem is harder than you might
suspect.

First, there is the fundamental mismatch of the designs of the
systems. I classify Maple as an "Engineering" system. That is,
the Maple system is designed for ease of use. It strives to
make the answers "work out ok". A subtle side-effect of this
design are cases where you subtract two matrices and get a 0 integer
rather than the 0 matrix. This zero integer can be used in further
computations unrelated to matrices.

I classify Axiom as a "theory" system. That is, Axiom is designed 
for correctness. It strives to make the answers match the theory.
Thus, subtracting two matrices will give you a 0 matrix. This 
strong typing is anything but easy to use. 

So the two systems started with different mindsets and virtually
every level of the design is constructed to support that mindset.
What is easy to write in 5 lines of Maple can take a great deal
of struggle in Axiom. The reverse is also true.

OpenMath presumes that there are two systems that support its
semantic definitions. That can be very hard for Maple if the
semantics are deeply related to the type. It can be very hard
for Axiom is the semantics are type-ambiguous.

Second, there is the semantic mismatch between Maple and Axiom.
Axiom's mathematics assume an inheritance model, local scoping
of variables in algebra code, etc. Maple's mathematics don't
support inheritance, variables have global scope, etc. It's
like the difference between Java and Basic. You made the point
that surely Maple could be programmed to accept Axiom's types.
Yes, it could but you'd end up building an Axiom interpreter
in Maple's interpreter language. I fail to see how OpenMath
would address such wildly differing environments like Java and
Basic or like Maple and Axiom. A great deal of the semantics in
Axiom's answers is encoded in the type. If I send an equation
to Maple I need the correct type returned. It can't be lost or
I've lost fundamental semantics.

Third, there is the syntactic mismatch. For primitive math you
might hope that Maple and Axiom use the same notation, at least.
Unfortunately this isn't true. Life gets much worse when you 
try to represent higher objects like Ideals or a Groebner basis.
Even the integrate function, which they both support heavily,
shares little, if any, syntax.

OpenMath is a good idea and is supported by a lot of clever
people. It might succeed. I could even be classified as a 
"mild supporter". But it doesn't stir my blood to want to write
code for it. If you're interested, however, I'm willing to discuss
ways to experiment with it. It is, after all, leading edge research
(my definition of research is doing something no one in the world
knows how to do) and Axiom has always been a great platform for
doing research.

Tim

I'm looking to get the newly announced but unavailable Sharp Zaurus
400Mhz, 128M, etc. It runs full linux on an Intel processor. Porting
should be fairly easy. Until that time I'm on a Palm which could be
made to run the code so I'm looking to retarget the back end of the
compiler. I'm trying to convince everyone on our project to use Aldor
as their development language as we're doing group theory work and
Aldor would be perfect. Plus I need to create a libPalm library for
Aldor that exposes the palm api and gui.

Axiom's been around for 30 years or so already. I expect it will last
at least as long in its open source version(s). We've got several people
with various interests, like program proof, new front ends, better algebra,
new algebra areas, teaching, etc so things are moving along quite quickly
despite the fact that it still isn't available (but hopefully by year-end
for the algebra portion).

Given the current funding model we're able to take Axiom anywhere we
can find an interesting thing to do. And there are dozens of people
who have interesting ways to use a computer algebra system.  This is
unlikely to change except to spread so the 30 year horizon is not 
unreasonable. I still consider Axiom a work-in-progress research
project and I believe that research ought to have long term horizons,
otherwise it is just development. Of course, somebody else will be
"driving the bus" by then so that's the whole motivation behind the
documentation effort.

Thank you for sending the tex for your thesis. It makes it so much
easier to work from the original sources. Once I get to the algebra
level of the system I'll look at the details of how to work it into
a pamphlet.

I used our camera to drive a robot that was arc-welding a seam between
large metal plates. Since everything was either BRIGHT WHITE or SCREAMINGLY
BRIGHT WHITE the 10bpp would have been overkill :-). I do envy you the
chance to work in vision though. It was a fun area when combined with
robotics work. If they need someone to repair it on Mars, call me.

Gentlemen,

I have recently found your Public Library of Science website
(www.publiclibraryofscience.org). I'm writing for two reasons.

First, I'd like to pass along the suggestion that you solicit
and accept Ph.D. thesis papers as these have already been 
reviewed and thus represent a low cost source of research.

Second, to let you know that I've begun a similar experiment.
Axiom is a computer algebra system which has recently been released
as open source. I'm creating an open source publication called the
"Axiom Journal". This differs from traditional journals in that all
of the articles are intended to be "literate programs". That is, 
the papers will include both the theory and the reduction-to-practice
of running code sewn together into a literate program (basically
TeX with a few extra tags).

The motivations are that (a) Axiom needs to meld theory and code
in order to create a system that will survive for the next 30 years
(b) other sciences require reduction to practice and repetition of
results so why not computational mathematics (c) paper is the wrong
medium to distribute computational mathematics results (d) the
theory, code and results need to be "open source" so everyone can
use, modify, maintain and build upon the results.

I'm in the process of defining the literate program format and
the submission guidelines. Eventually they will be available at
www.nongnu.org/axiom/Journal/index.html.

I'd suggest investigating formats beyond the ones used by the
current journals. You are, after all, using a new medium so why
not rethink the format to exploit the medium?

Gentlemen,

I've just visited your Handbook of Mathematical Functions website
(http://dlmf.nist.gov).  I see that you have a chapter in the handbook
on Computer Algebra but I do not see anyone listed as an author.

I'm interested in this project and, in particular, the algorithms
portion of the various chapters. 

I'm working to open source Axiom, which is a computer algebra system
that was released to me by the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG) in
September 2002. I'd like to know more about your plans to approach
algorithms and their descriptions. It would be of great value to
the scientific community if the algorithms were available in a 
language that could be run in an open source computer algebra system
like Axiom. In particular, Axiom is one of the "big 3", Mathematica
and Maple being the other two, and is a fully general purpose 
system with a large range of functions. Axiom will be available at
http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom as soon as I complete the
process of making it open source.

Can you tell me if an author has been chosen for the Computer Algebra
section? Can you tell me if you plan to publish the algorithms (the
sample chapter has none)?

Gentlemen,

I've read your section on Design Considerations. It is clear that
mathematical equations are ambiguous without context. You have
suggested using several annotation mechanisms.

I would like to suggest that you consider using literate programming
tools to provide the mechanism to carry the annotations. Literate
programs are able to mix LaTeX documents and code fragments in a
natural way. It provides a framework that will handle all of your
concerns, including Notes, References, OpenMath and Attributes.

In particular, however, literate programs give you the ability to
combine runnable code mixed with the paper giving background theory.
This will make the handbook much more useful as people who wish to
use a particular section can automatically extract the runnable
algorithm from the literate program. From the same source text you
can also extract theory, documentation and references.

As I'm sure you know this is not a new idea as Knuth and Dijkstra
proposed it in the 70s. However the latest implementations have 
moved away from specific languages and are now general purpose.
Norman Ramsey has an implementation, called noweb, that would
suit your purposes well. The noweb programs are freely available.

I just got it to compute 2+2
It lives!

There are, of course, a pile of breakages that need to be fixed
and the build procedures need to be reworked but the heart of the
system is beginning to function. The plan is to have an alpha
release by year-end.

Congratulations!  An outstanding achievement!  And, BTW, everything
works with current GCL cvs if one does a few MAKE-PACKAGE commands in
the image first, as you suggested.

Take care,
