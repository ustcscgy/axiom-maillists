I'm new to AXIOM, and have just built the download version on SuSE
Linux 8.1

I've been comparing the output of the tex function from this AXIOM build
with that given in Jenks & Sutor pg 103.

The output I get uses 

$$, \over and \sp,  (ie TeX)

rather than the expected

\[, \frac and ^   (ie LaTeX)

The command latex (just a guess on my part) returns a "not implemented"
error. Is it possible to have AXIOM produce LaTeX output?  If so, how?

Many thanks indeed for any help you can offer.

Chris Sangwin

Currently, it is not possible to produce good Latex output in free
Axiom. This is known bug, however I don't know when it will be fixed.

$$ and \over are perfectly valid commands in LaTeX, so I don't see any bug=
 
in Axiom output, at least when it exports begin/end of formulas and 
fractions ? I think further that it is the best way to export these 
properties/functions, as it can be used by both Plain TeX and LaTeX users.=
 
Using \[, \] and \frac would limit Axiom to LaTeX users only.

Best wishes,
Michel

Dear Michel,

Many thanks for your reply - you are correct of course.  However, the
reason for wanting \frac and ^ rather than \over and \sp is that I shall
be using AXIOM to produce HTLM pages on the fly by piping the output via
TtH.  This does not support \sp, hence my request.

I wish to combine the output generated by AXIOM, with mathematical text
written in LaTeX and produce an HTML page on the fly, ie no editing of the
page allowed by me for fine tuning.  This is part of a computer aided
assessment system and has been done very successfully using Maple and TtH. =
=20
I am confident with this technique for my purposes.  I want to use an open
source CAS, rather than Maple, and hence my choice of AXIOM.

I know that this isn't the only route for displaying mathematics on the
web.  Of course, I'm operating with a number of constraints. I will be
using the results with students, and requiring them to have a plugin
component of any kind is a real barrier.  I want the resulting pages to be
viewed on the major browers. If I choose another route (math ML for
example), this will be a real problem.

I have two further questions

(1) Can I modify the TeX function, to fine tune the output in a
MyTeX() function?  If so, where should I look? =20

(2) Can anyone suggest an alternative route to generating HTML
fragments from AXIOM expressions?

Many thanks indeed.
Chris Sangwin

Chris,

Sorry for the delay. I had to prepare for a class.

As I understand it you would rather have \frac rather than \over
as output for fractions, for example. Since we have the source
clearly this can be changed. Unfortunately the change is not likely
to be simple because the forms are in different order. You would
like 

{a} \over {b}   => \frace{a}{b}

I'll look to see where the latex for \over is created.
Is it possible to define \over in a .sty file on your side?

Joris has a similar complaint. I'm unsure if his "standard latex"
is the same as your "standard latex"


An alternative path, which I've also mentioned to Joris, is to 
keep the current output unchanged and implement another output
(HTML-tool, Texmacs) for the different front ends.

I managed to solve the problem with power series with variable 
coefficients over a field as follows, but I still don't know why the 
first approach didn't work. Here is what I did:

First I define some coefficient function ycoeff with a nice recursive 
definition:

       ycoeff: Integer -> FRAC POLY PrimeField 2;
       ycoeff(0)==1; ycoeff(1)==a;
       ycoeff(n | n>1 and even? n)==0;
       ycoeff(n | n>1 and odd? n) == b*ycoeff((n-1)/2-1)^2;

Then I try to form a power series from it using the GENUPS package:

       series(n +-> ycoeff(n), z=0)

which gives me

       1+az+bz^3+a^2bz^5+b^3z^9+O(z^11)

with type UnivariatePuiseuxSeries(Expression Integer, z, 0), so here the 
coefficients have been turned into Expression Integer, whereas I still 
want them to be FRAC POLY PrimeField 2.

However, I get the correct result by forming a stream manually:
       stream := [ycoeff(n) for n in 0..];
       series(stream)$UTS(FRAC POLY PrimeField 2, z, 0)

This should be more or less equivalent to what GENUPS does, but seems to 
  retain the coefficient type.

Dear Chris,

Personally, I use TeX4ht, by Eytan Gurari, to output HTML from LaTeX,  
because it allows to process LaTeX files that use packages together with 
your personal additional definitions, and also Plain TeX . The reason is 
that TeX4ht  uses TeX itself to process the source files, in addition to 
its own program. All other LaTeX -> html software I know use a dictionary 
(i.e. a finite table of conversion, as compared to the potentially 
infinite number of LaTeX commands) to produce html output. Therefore, as 
soon as you use a definition unknown to the software (TtH or whatever) 
coming from a LaTeX package or of your own, you are stuck. Or, more 
exactly, you have to add manually a corresponding entry into the table (if=
 
you are courageous) or make the software to ignore it (I confess sadly 
that's what I did in practice for most unknown commands, when I used 
TeX2rtf, before TeX4ht :-() .

I imagine this could be done, with the present state of Axiom, by 
processing the tex output with TeX4ht instead of TtH.
I suppose you just want to create html output without any editing, and 
don't mean "on the fly" in the sense of imaxima.el, where each formula 
submitted to Maxima is output in tex, compiled individually and displayed 
inside the Emacs buffer as an image (if I understood well the process) ?

Yes, I agree with you. IMHO, the most secure and universal way is to 
display formulas as gif or png images, the same way as imaxima.el. Some 
people say it is not beautiful, so one has to choose between beauty and 
rigor I think.

I am not sure to understand the question?

William Schelter had developed a very clever way to add formulas outputted=
 
by Maxima directly into html files, with the 2d output of Maxima. You can 
see an example in the Maxima's tutorial, in the lower window of Xmaxima. 
It is not as beautiful as LaTeX output with Emacs + imaxima.el, of course,=
 
but it is html, and it is usable on any browser I think. WS had told me it=
 
was one of his main projects, but unfortunately he couldn't go to the end,=
 
and I don't know in which direction he intended to go. Maybe Jim Amundson 
or Tim Daly would know more about that?

An even simpler path, to write a converter that inputs TeX-ish LaTeX
and converts it to LaTeX-ish syntax: { xxxxxx \over yyyyyy } to
\frac{xxxxxx}{yyyyyy}, \sp to ^, $$.....$$ to \[....\] etc.

Chris Sangwin,

If you haven't already tried it, I would strongly suggest that
you take a look at TeXmacs. TeXmacs is open source and quite
actively maintained.

  http://www.texmacs.org

TeXmacs provides an interface to Axiom and several other open
source CAS as well as Mathematica and (older versions) of
Maple. Output is rendered in gui form. TeXmacs also does a
"credible" job of exporting to HTML and LaTeX. TeXmacs can
import LaTeX documents.

It is possible but not easy because there is no *one place* to
look. In Axiom TeX generation output generation is distributed
over each module (several hundred).

This was my motivation for mentioning TeXmacs.

Huh.  Just curious, but why was this design direction taken?  Do the
various modules need that much customization when outputing TeX?  IIRC,
Maxima's TeX output functions are mostly (all?) contained in
mactex.lisp, and that seems to have worked so far.

Does that also mean that if someone wanted to teach axiom to output
presentation mathml (for example) they would have to teach each module
how to output it individually?

        t was reported on this list some time ago that OpenMath was
        supported in Axiom (it requires you to download a library, and
        hasn't been tested recently). The relevant source code appears
        to be in algebra/openmath.spad.pamphlet.

You could obtain, or write, an XSLT to convert OpenMath to
presentation MathML, which could then be included in your XHTML
document. Presentation MathML is supported by Mozilla, W3C's Amaya, and I am not
sure what else.

I certainly can not speak for the designers, but it seems to
me that this is quite natural given Axiom's "object oriented"
design philosophy. Axiom was implemented in this manner as a
leading edge research project long before the concept was
even called that by the rest of the computer science community.
By modern programming language standards in some ways the
implementation is primitive and it other ways it is still
leading edge research.

Basically, output is just another "type" in Axiom - a kind
of external representation of something which also has
(possibly several) internal representation. For example if you
want to display a multiplication symbol in some mathematical
context, say expressions involving scalars and matrices you
need to "coerce" an object of one type EXPRESSION MATRIX
FLOAT to another type OUTPUTFORM ... It is during this
conversion that the decision as to which graphic character
should be used in OUTPUTFORM is made. The code to do this
is part of the implementation of the object. Something
that is a valid LaTeX expression for the multiplication of
a scalar by a matrix is of a different OUTPUTFORM type from
say that same thing in a 2-d ASCII representation and it is
different again from it's representation in the old IBM script
language (still available in Axiom!) and for that matter in
MATHML.

This is only an illustration. I am sorry I don't have time
right now to prepare an actual demonstration in Axiom. But
the decision to make these conversions part the object's
definition seems especially appropriate if you think about
the problem of encoding mathematical semantics in an output
form such as OpenMath.

> outputting TeX?

I said "several hundred modules", but perhaps that is an
exaggeration since many of these conversions can be simply
inherited from other objects higher up in the type hierarchy.

Certainly Maxima (and other similar computer algebra systems)
"works", but it works in a very different way than Axiom.

Not exactly (see above), but depending just how much of the
mathematical semantic context is embedded in your desired
output form, then I think the answer is yes, in principle.
(MathML has considerably more semantic content then LaTex.)

Hi all,

I am looking for a way to handle algebraic expressions over finite 
fields that will allow me to take square roots of variables. For 
example, I want something like

    (sqrt(a)*w + w^2)::UTS(EXPR INT, w, 0)

but in positive characteristic. There is apparently no such thing as 
EXPR PrimeField 2.

I am currently using FRAC POLY PrimeField 2, which allows me to form 
rational functions of variables, but not to take square roots. Is there 
a more appropriate domain available?

Is it possible to work with transcendental field extensions?

Thanks,
Marcus

Marcus,

I looked back thru my email logs and apparently I never replied.
Sorry about that.

The type UTS(EXPR INT, w, 0) seems to be constructed fine here.
and (sqrt(a)*w + w^2)::UTS(EXPR INT,w,0) also is a correct
construction.


EXPR has the signature: 
    Expression(R:OrderedSet)
but if we ask about PrimeField(2):
    PrimeField(2) has OrderedSet  ==>  false
so Axiom will not allow you to build the type because 
PrimeField(2) lacks the OrderedSet property.

> I am currently using FRAC POLY PrimeField 2, which allows me to form

You can build this type because the signature of POLY is:
   PolynomialRing(R:Ring, E:OrderedAbelianMonoid)
and
   PrimeField(2) has Ring  ==>  true

So, on a type basis, your question becomes "Can I find a domain which
will accept the properties of PrimeField(2) and which supports rational
functions of variables".

You can find a lot of information about PrimeField(2) by typing:
   )show PrimeField(2)
Unfortunately it does not show that it is a Ring even though Axiom
can decide the question (as above).

I can't find a domain directly for what you want but there are many
polynomial-style domains (see the src/algebra subdirectory and grep
for poly) and one of them might fit your needs. You need to look
at the signatures and then ask 'PrimeField(2) has ' questions to
see if the construction will be valid. 

>Is it possible to work with transcendental field extensions?

Yes. I can't give you an example off the top of my head however.
This is Manuel Bronstein's area of expertise.
 
Tim

Yes, I figured that would be the reason.

Actually, FRAC POLY PrimeField 2 seems to work well for rational 
functions of variables, but it does not allow, say, square roots of the 
variables. Perhaps there is some way to express that 'a is a new 
variable such that a^2=b where b just another variable?

Ok, I will grep around in the sources...

Thanks for your help,

The categories that are defined in algfunc.spad 
(AlgebraicallyClosedField, AlgebraicallyClosedFunctionSpace etc) all 
seem to impose the OrderedSet assumptions for the underlying domains.

I probably don't know the code well enough, but is this OrderedSet 
restriction really motivated? It would appear that most of these 
operations, such as rootsOf and friends, make perfect sense without 
OrderedSet.

For instance, it should be possible to apply these operations to 
PrimeField 2, as I have been trying to do, even though it is not an 
OrderedSet.

Unless someone tells me that I've got it all wrong here, I might just 
clone the code in algfunc.spad and see what happens.

Marcus,

Cloning the needed category and domain with new names and
changing the restriction on the parameters from OrderedSet 
to Set is what I would have suggested. 

You may run into later code that has tests like:

   if R has OrderedSet

which will not allow you to build Domains or will allow
you to build Domains but elide certain functions. Axiom
can construct a Domain that has code conditioned on 
categorical properties (so matricies over integers may
not have an inverse function, for example).

Tim

Could someone point me to some documentation about the use of .as files 
to extend AXIOM?

I've just compiled AXIOM and realised that the Aldor compiler is not in 
the distribution. OK, it's not too difficult to get it from aldor.org 
and install it.

But what I am missing is libaxiom.a[l].

I have found it here

dragonfly:/zvol/axiom/cvs>find |grep libaxiom
./axiom/src/share/algebra/libaxiom.al

but not in the installation directory after 'make install'.

I would find it very helpful if after a compilation there would be a 
line printed which points me to some web-page (or even local page) where 
I then can find additional things that need be done in order to get a 
complete system (like installing TeXmacs and aldor, and copying 
libaxiom.al by hand etc.)

Ralf,

As I haven't been using the Aldor compiler I don't know the procedure.
Some of Axiom's users have and I'll ask.

We need to figure out a way to work with the aldor.org folks
to get an installable distribution for Axiom. It is clearly
possible to do but it will need "packaging".

That's a good idea. I don't have this information readily available
but I'll look it up and write it.

Hi Ralf,

Provided that you want to use Aldor to extend the standard Axiom system
and things haven't changed too much in the open system then just issuing
e.g. )co foo.as from within Axiom should work.  The only slightly tricky
thing is when you want to mix your own spad code with your own aldor
code (i.e. the spad code isn't in libaxiom.al).  Then the procedure is
as follows:

1. In Axiom do e.g. the following:
   cons : List Symbol := ['RealPolynomialUtilitiesPackage, _
            'RealRootCharacterizationCategory, 'RealClosedField, _
            'RightOpenIntervalRootCharacterization, 'RealClosure]
   (these are your spad constructors and the order is important and should 
    reflect dependencies as in the spad file).

    makeAxFile("reclos.ax",cons)$Lisp 

    )sys axiomxl -Wname=axiom -lAxiomLib=axiom -Y $AXIOM/../../share/algebra reclos.ax

2. Now you should have a file called reclos.ao.  In your Aldor file put:
   #include "axiom.as"
   #library RealClosure "reclos.ao"
   import from RealClosure;
   ... and with any luck you should be in business ...

I hope this helps!

Cheers, Mike.

I cannot figure out what I have done wrong.

I set up Aldor and Axiom and I can compile the file

--- xxx.as --
#include "axiom"
aaa(i:Integer): Integer == {
         i+1;
}
---- end xxx.as --

by saying

aldor -O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y 
$AXIOM/algebra xxx.as

(Note that these are the options that are suggested by default by AXIOM.)

However if I say

)compile "/home/hemmecke/xxx.as"

within AXIOM, it responds...

--------------
    Compiling AXIOM source code from file /home/hemmecke/xxx.as using
       AXIOM-XL compiler and options
-O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y 
$AXIOM/algebra
       Use the system command )set compiler args to change these
       options.

    >> System error:
 
#p"/z_mnt/kludge/zlocal/md6/aldor/aldor-1.0.1-linux-i386-gmp4/aldor/linux/1.0.1/bin/" 
is not of type STRING.

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)
------------------

I cannot see where I should look for the problem.
Does anybody have some workaround?

Ralf

Tim, et al.

I think it would be great if we could get Axiom into
a state where it could be included on one of these
stand-alone Linux CD rom products. I think it might
lead to a lot of good exposure of Axiom to the "next
generation".

  http://www.nongnu.org/axiom
  http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/axiom

Does anyone have an opinion about the best way to
approach this?

Can we set a target date to be ready for this? Say, at
the latest sometime before next September. Earlier?
How much needs to be done to get Axiom ready? I use
Axiom right now with TeXmacs with very few problems,
but of course it is not what I would call "turn-key".
But then neither are many of the other open source
packages that are included in the list of software
mentioned in the email below.

Ideas?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Chu-Ching and Others,

SciLix is a LiveCD for Universitary Teaching based on Morphix (a =
modular
derived of Knoppix). Its intended for CAS and Algoritmic Programing and
shares a lot of programs with the LiveCD that Chu-Ching its doing
(except Macaulay and the documents). Also it uses the XFCE light weigth
integrated desktop enrironment instead of KDE for faster performance on
Ram and Hard Disk and less space utilization.

You can get more info about it in:

http://www.javeriana.edu.co/ciencias/u_sistemas/proyectos/scilix_en.html=


(A new updated and corrected english version will be available soon)

This is also and oportunity to celebrate the joining efforts of the
Freeduc and the SciLix Projects. Freeduc is a Educative LiveCD =
sponsored
by the Unesco and Hilaire Fernandez, developer leader of
Ofset(Organization for Free Software in Education and Teaching) , has
offered to me the Freeduc Leadership and maintenance of the Freeduc
Project (and I have acepted likely), so its also the oportunity to say
thanks for the recognition of the, not always visible, latin american
contribution in the free software development. As a result of that =
join,
SciLix counts with a new and bigger ftp server. You can download the
last ISO image and mainmodules at:

ftp://developer.ofset.org/pub/scilix/

I hope you enjoy,

Offray.

Pdt: Chu-Ching, wich is the license for the included documentation of
Calculus and Demos in LiveTeXmacs? Have you considered the
CreativeCommons Atribution Share-Alike license for that documents?
(www.creativecommons.org). May be in this way I can Include a spanish
version of that documents in the SciLix CD and we can join even more
efforts. Would be nice some documentation about the inclusion of
Macaulay.

Hi all,

Axiom is already included in the pre-0.2 version of SciLix, but at the
release included has a bug when is called from TeXmacs. I get this
message:

(AXIOM Sockets) The AXIOM Server is undefined.

I'm apt-geting axiom righ now. I hope this version will solve the
integration problem with TeXmacs. I like a lot the Axiom project and the
idea about Literate Programming from TeXmacs, and the use of it as a
system for building axiom documentation. Have you considered the
Creative Commons License for that documentation? I can help with
translations.

The 0.2 release of SciLix will have the integration bug solved I hope,
and eventually the Axiom Manual integrated.

Cheers,

Offray

Hi Ralf,

This looks like an error being thrown within lisp and is probably due to
some sort of CCL/GCL incompatibility.  If you can force a backtrace you
should be able to find out where the error actually occurs.
Unfortunately I don't have the open Axiom sources and the last NAG
version (Axiom 2.3) handles this correctly.

Regards, Mike.

I'm the one who put the Debian axiom package together, and there still
appears to be issues with texmacs, at least as the latter is
distributed by Debian.  I'm not sure the Debian texmacs axiom
interface is the latest.  Unfortunately, I don't have time to chase
this down right now.

Wouldn't it be better if each of the CAS programs shipped their own
texmacs interface, maybe even dh_installtexmacs in Debian?

Take care,

Axiom has moved to gcl-2.6.2 (pre-release) on savannah.
This will have no impact on anything. 

You can download the lastest sources with:

export CVS_RSH=ssh
cvs -z3 -d:ext:anoncvs@savannah.nongnu.org:/cvsroot/axiom co axiom

Dear Tim,

	I have tried to install gnu-arch (tla), but the recent rpm's rely
on the glibc.2.3.2 and my SuSE 8.0 is using an older glibc. Since its
quite risky to change the glibc in a running system, I have to update to
SuSE 9.0 or to try to compile gnu-arch. Hence, would it be a geart problem
for you, to put the axiom book to the savannah server, since I don't have
any problems with cvs ;-)

cheers
BF.

Hi Mike,

Right, it works with Axiom 2.3. (Since I have set ALDORROOT and 
AXIOMXLROOT to point to the new aldor compiler (not the one which comes 
with Axiom 2.3), I had to make a link
   ln -s aldor.conf axiomxl.conf
in $ALDORROOT/include.

Unfortunately, I don't know how to force a backtrace.

Is OpenAxiom relying on the environment variable ALDORROOT or AXIOMXLROOT?

Ralf,

I'll download the latest aldor compiler and see if I can recreate the 
problem.

Ralf,

Yes, that is *exactly* right! For TeXmacs AXIOMsys should be
in your PATH.

Bill Page.

Hello,

Is the simplex algorithm implemented in AXIOM?

Not that I'm aware of. The machinery is there but I don't think
anyone has written the specific algorithm.
