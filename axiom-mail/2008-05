I've been using Maxima a bit recently, and I've been thinking about Axiom in
comparison.  I think Axiom's mathematical strengths are undeniable, but...


   1. The Axiom community seems to be worried about the wrong things.
   Abstruse mathematical problems, matters relating to Aldor... and yet the
   interface languishes.  In fact, for Windows users (who make up the bulk of
   computer users) there is no decent interface.
   2. Help - Hyperdoc was all very well in its day, but now looks regressive
   and old-fashioned.  Surely help based on HTML, or even a Windows Help
   interface, should be provided?
   3. Maxima seems streets ahead in its involvement with the mathematical
   community.  Currently there are at least two major book writing projects
   using Maxima: "Maxima by Example" on http://www.csulb.edu/~woollett/ and
   another on http://www.neng.usu.edu/cee/faculty/gurro/Maxima.html  There
   are lots of other tutorials and documents (including one by me!) on the
   Maxima page.  But where are the user-written Axiom books and introduction
   documents?  The biggest one - in fact the only one available from the Axiom
   page - seems to be Martin Dunstan's tutorial from 1996!
   4. A new user, scouting around for a freeware CAS, would be led to the
   undeniable conclusion that Axiom is simply a hobby for a few dedicated
   users, whereas Maxima is being developed to be useful for everybody.
   5. The various forks: Axiom, FriCAS, OpenAxiom, also must make it hard
   for the new user - which one to choose, and why?  The many many
   distributions of Linux make choosing one awfully hard for the beginner -
   even I, who've been using Linux exclusively for over 15 years, get confused
   on the rare occasions I have to install a new system.  Axiom has the same
   problem.

Now don't get me wrong - I like Axiom very much indeed, and I will keep
using it, and encouraging my students to do likewise.  But I think it needs
to reach more users if it is to really succeed, and for this it needs more
help and tutorials, and better interfaces.

cheers,
Alasdair

Alasdair, 

Thanks for the feedback.

>comparison.  I think Axiom's mathematical strengths are undeniable, but...

Maxima is an excellent program. I know several of the developers
and they do great work. I have used it most recently to check Axiom's
answers. I compared Axiom against Schaums and then did a doublecheck
using Maxima. Maxima has one really annoying feature in that it asks
me if -some-random-expression is positive.

I've been concentrating on making Axiom more useful in general. 
Some of the features are 

  * )show domain correctly identifies the source file

  * )d op foo shows an example of how to use that function
      Given that there are approximate 10k functions in Axiom it
      will take a while before all of them have examples but the
      machinery exists and some cases are covered. More will follow.

  * )help pages have been updated. 
      There are now about 100 help pages and more are in the pipeline.
      The help pages are flat text pages so you can write your own.
      If you put your text file in the proper directory it is automatically
      available.

  * There is a tutorial book available.
      The sources are distributed with the system (see
      src/doc/bookvol1.pamphlet, an ordinary latex file), the .dvi
      file is created automatically during build, a pdf copy is
      available for free from <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org>, and
      paper copies are available from amazon.com or lulu.com (search
      on amazon for "daly axiom")

  * The Jenks textbook is available
      The sources are distributed with the system (see
      src/doc/book.pamphlet, an ordinary latex file), the .dvi
      file is created automatically during build, a pdf copy is
      available for free from <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org>, and
      an html version is available at
      <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hyperdoc/jenks.html>

  * Some domains are already literate. 
      Look at <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org> for the list, which
      contains only one at the moment but will be expanded at the 
      next release cycle point later this month.

  * Regression test files have more documentation
      The student can look at the latest input files for examples.
      In particular, there are 34 new src/input/schaumNN.input.pamphlet 
      files which show how to compute 619 indefinite integrals from a 
      standard reference work (Schaums Mathematical Handbook). They
      also illustrate methods of simplification. I've also collected
      all of the rule forms used and these will appear in a new help
      page and the next version of the tutorial.

  * System commands are beginning to know about pamphlet files
      Soon you'll be able to work directly in the literate format
      and the compiler and interpreter will "do the right thing".
      Pamphlet files are the native Axiom file format. Hopefully
      this will encourage more literate programming.

I really liked wxMaxima and developed a wxAxiom version but decided
to trash it. Instead of creating more code to maintain I decided to
base the user interface on the Firefox browser. Hyperdoc and graphics
will go away in their present form and become standard web pages.

In the latest release of Axiom, the hyperdoc system is based on Firefox.
All you need to do is start Axiom and then type:
   )browse
and visit the rootpage.xhtml file in your distribution.
If you don't have it available yet, you can see the static pages at:
<http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hyperdoc/rootpage.xhtml>
These pages are live only if you use the )browse function locally.

Many hyperdoc pages have been translated but there are still more to
be done.  The richest subtree is under "Topics". The Axiom textbook is
available under the "Axiom Textbook" link. In addition, there is new
material in the Firefox version that does not exist in the hyperdoc
version. See
    Topics -> Cryptography
    Topics -> Mathematical Models (under construction)
    Topics -> CATS (under construction)

Note that this uses MathML so you may have to upgrade your browser fonts.
The fonts are available in the zips directory of the Axiom distribution.

This is standard html so you can write your own pages. See the book
src/hyper/bookvol11.pamphlet which describes the tools available if
you want to interact with Axiom on your own pages.

If you do develop coursework I'm willing to work with you to include
those pages into Axiom's Firefox browser. See
<http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hyperdoc/cryptopage.xhtml>

Future releases will have a primitive Firefox front end to Axiom,
similar in spirit (but not design) to the MMA, Maple, and Sage notebooks.
I'm working on various tools in javascript but they are not ready for
release yet. I'm also in design discussions with a graphics designer
to try to maximize the user viewpoint. This will take a few release
cycles to fully emerge.

There are currently 12 volumes in development for Axiom, of which only
one has reached publication. Each release of Axiom contains updated
material in each volume. I'll post the current state of the volumes
on the website at the next release of the system. They already exist
and can be found by searching the source tree with
   find . -name "book*"

Writing readable source material takes an astonishing amount of time.

Sage is certainly taking the lead in the "freeware CAS" market and
I'm actively helping that to occur. I'm on their program committee
for the Sage Day and I build the MAC OSX 10.4 binary for them.

That said, I believe that Sage is badly designed (well, accretion is
more the philosophy) and is not the way to teach students to think
about computational mathematics. The litany of problems they have
left unsolved would have to be embedded in <rant> tags.

Axiom has the philosophy that it needs to be done as a literate
program so that future people can read, understand, maintain, and
modify the system. Axiom's approach to computational mathematics
strongly emphasizes the algebraic knowledge necessary to do correct
mathematics. The symbolic approach (everything is a token that can
be manipulated regardless of mathematical meaning) is sure to cause
grief to beginning students, if not professionals.

Sigh. <joke> To misquote Neo and the Spoon Boy from the Matrix:
              SB:  "There is no fork"
              Neo: "There is no fork?"
              SB:  "It is not the code that forks, only yourself"
      </joke>

What you choose to teach is a strong influence on your system choice.

I believe we are on the same page with this. Unfortunately, most of
the pages are blank. I'm writing as fast as I can. I'm hiring a
student out of my personal funds to do some Axiom work for me for the
summer. Making a fully documented, easy (well, easier) to use system
out of an undocumented research project of this size is a glacial
undertaking.

Alasdair, 

Thanks for the feedback.

>comparison.  I think Axiom's mathematical strengths are undeniable, but...

Maxima is an excellent program. I know several of the developers
and they do great work. I have used it most recently to check Axiom's
answers. I compared Axiom against Schaums and then did a doublecheck
using Maxima. Maxima has one really annoying feature in that it asks
me if -some-random-expression is positive.

I've been concentrating on making Axiom more useful in general. 
Some of the features are 

  * )show domain correctly identifies the source file

  * )d op foo shows an example of how to use that function
      Given that there are approximate 10k functions in Axiom it
      will take a while before all of them have examples but the
      machinery exists and some cases are covered. More will follow.

  * )help pages have been updated. 
      There are now about 100 help pages and more are in the pipeline.
      The help pages are flat text pages so you can write your own.
      If you put your text file in the proper directory it is automatically
      available.

  * There is a tutorial book available.
      The sources are distributed with the system (see
      src/doc/bookvol1.pamphlet, an ordinary latex file), the .dvi
      file is created automatically during build, a pdf copy is
      available for free from <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org>, and
      paper copies are available from amazon.com or lulu.com (search
      on amazon for "daly axiom")

  * The Jenks textbook is available
      The sources are distributed with the system (see
      src/doc/book.pamphlet, an ordinary latex file), the .dvi
      file is created automatically during build, a pdf copy is
      available for free from <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org>, and
      an html version is available at
      <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hyperdoc/jenks.html>

  * Some domains are already literate. 
      Look at <http://axiom.axiom-developer.org> for the list, which
      contains only one at the moment but will be expanded at the 
      next release cycle point later this month.

  * Regression test files have more documentation
      The student can look at the latest input files for examples.
      In particular, there are 34 new src/input/schaumNN.input.pamphlet 
      files which show how to compute 619 indefinite integrals from a 
      standard reference work (Schaums Mathematical Handbook). They
      also illustrate methods of simplification. I've also collected
      all of the rule forms used and these will appear in a new help
      page and the next version of the tutorial.

  * System commands are beginning to know about pamphlet files
      Soon you'll be able to work directly in the literate format
      and the compiler and interpreter will "do the right thing".
      Pamphlet files are the native Axiom file format. Hopefully
      this will encourage more literate programming.

I really liked wxMaxima and developed a wxAxiom version but decided
to trash it. Instead of creating more code to maintain I decided to
base the user interface on the Firefox browser. Hyperdoc and graphics
will go away in their present form and become standard web pages.

In the latest release of Axiom, the hyperdoc system is based on Firefox.
All you need to do is start Axiom and then type:
   )browse
and visit the rootpage.xhtml file in your distribution.
If you don't have it available yet, you can see the static pages at:
<http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hyperdoc/rootpage.xhtml>
These pages are live only if you use the )browse function locally.

Many hyperdoc pages have been translated but there are still more to
be done.  The richest subtree is under "Topics". The Axiom textbook is
available under the "Axiom Textbook" link. In addition, there is new
material in the Firefox version that does not exist in the hyperdoc
version. See
    Topics -> Cryptography
    Topics -> Mathematical Models (under construction)
    Topics -> CATS (under construction)

Note that this uses MathML so you may have to upgrade your browser fonts.
The fonts are available in the zips directory of the Axiom distribution.

This is standard html so you can write your own pages. See the book
src/hyper/bookvol11.pamphlet which describes the tools available if
you want to interact with Axiom on your own pages.

If you do develop coursework I'm willing to work with you to include
those pages into Axiom's Firefox browser. See
<http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/hyperdoc/cryptopage.xhtml>

Future releases will have a primitive Firefox front end to Axiom,
similar in spirit (but not design) to the MMA, Maple, and Sage notebooks.
I'm working on various tools in javascript but they are not ready for
release yet. I'm also in design discussions with a graphics designer
to try to maximize the user viewpoint. This will take a few release
cycles to fully emerge.

There are currently 12 volumes in development for Axiom, of which only
one has reached publication. Each release of Axiom contains updated
material in each volume. I'll post the current state of the volumes
on the website at the next release of the system. They already exist
and can be found by searching the source tree with
   find . -name "book*"

Writing readable source material takes an astonishing amount of time.

Sage is certainly taking the lead in the "freeware CAS" market and
I'm actively helping that to occur. I'm on their program committee
for the Sage Day and I build the MAC OSX 10.4 binary for them.

That said, I believe that Sage is badly designed (well, accretion is
more the philosophy) and is not the way to teach students to think
about computational mathematics. The litany of problems they have
left unsolved would have to be embedded in <rant> tags.

Axiom has the philosophy that it needs to be done as a literate
program so that future people can read, understand, maintain, and
modify the system. Axiom's approach to computational mathematics
strongly emphasizes the algebraic knowledge necessary to do correct
mathematics. The symbolic approach (everything is a token that can
be manipulated regardless of mathematical meaning) is sure to cause
grief to beginning students, if not professionals.

Sigh. <joke> To misquote Neo and the Spoon Boy from the Matrix:
              SB:  "There is no fork"
              Neo: "There is no fork?"
              SB:  "It is not the code that forks, only yourself"
      </joke>

What you choose to teach is a strong influence on your system choice.

I believe we are on the same page with this. Unfortunately, most of
the pages are blank. I'm writing as fast as I can. I'm hiring a
student out of my personal funds to do some Axiom work for me for the
summer. Making a fully documented, easy (well, easier) to use system
out of an undocumented research project of this size is a glacial
undertaking.

Dear All,

I'm getting compile failures with the following error message

make[4]: Entering directory
`/usr/local/src/axiom-200803/lsp/gcl-2.6.8pre/cmpnew'
../unixport/saved_pre_gcl ../unixport/ -compile gcl_collectfn.lsp
make[4]: ../unixport/saved_pre_gcl: Command not found
make[4]: *** [gcl_collectfn.o] Error 127

with both January 2008 and March 2008 versions of Axiom.  System is
Fedora 8, and this happens whether or not I rig the configure script
to set SYSNAME=fedora5.  The January version compiled successfully as
of a couple of months ago, so presumably something in a recent yum
upgrade broke it.  Googling suggests others have encountered this, but
no sign of a solution.  Any ideas, please?

Thanks,

Dan Hatton

None of this is meant in a negative way, I just want to add my experiences
as a Maxima user coming to Axiom.

So, I am extremely new to Axiom, in fact I pretty much don't know how to do
anything I want with the system, even after reading the introductory
materials.  But I just want to say that Alasdair has some good points from
my point of view.

When I was searching for a free CAS I found Maxima first (around 6 years
ago?) and stuck to it.  I was not aware of the existence of Sage and Axiom
until 6ish months ago.  This is odd considering as far as I can tell,
Axiom's plan for the future might be the best among the options.  Granted, I
am from an engineering background, not mathematics.

This is really big, but perhaps not for the reasons one might think.  I have
read some of Prof. Woollett's chapters and they leave something to be
desired for anyone not brand spanking new to the system.  In fact, for any
advanced usage information, nothing seems to replace the mailing list which
is perhaps 10 times as active as axiom-developer and axiom-math put
together.  What this does show is that Maxima has a user base that cares
about it.  Archaic languages such as C survive because they have a large
user base, which creates more development/ease of
use/portability/efficiency, which draws more people to the language.  The
fact that more people seem (are?) interested in Maxima makes it seem that
the project is healthier than Axiom.

Perhaps some public relations work would help?

Once again, this seems to point to an overall relative unhealthiness in
Axiom as compared to Maxima.  When projects fork, it necessarily applies
stress to the users (and I assume developers).  But more importantly, it
makes the choice more complicated for new users.  As a newcomer, it looks
like rats leaving a sinking ship, but should you trust a rats assessment of
the ships status?  As sad as it may be, people, in my experience, do not
like choices.  Tell me, is there any bad blood behind the forks?

Tim, please tell me that Firefox will not be the only way to interface with
Axiom.  It will still be possible to write an Emacs mode for it, something
like IMaxima?  Also, why only Firefox, why not any browser?

There is an emacs mode.  PLEASE try it and give feedback.

You'll find it on mathaction.

Martin,

please learn to make the life easier for others. You know the link. So 
why not put it in the posting?

Please look at my reply to Alasdair. There are links to other free

Seriously, though, I have no idea how to increase mailing list posts.

There was a disagreement about the vision and long term goals of the
Axiom project. I cannot speak for any other project but Axiom has the
goal of making a sustainable system that can form the basis for the
science of computational mathematics.

To be sustainable means that users must be able to understand,
maintain, and modify the system. Understanding the system implies that
people can know the "why and what", that is, why a piece of code is
written the way it is and what the code actually does.  The "why" is
generally not available in most systems, even though this is
fundamentally important (e.g. writing the code in a special way was
done to optimize cache-load times). The "what" is generally only
available from published algorithms cached in pay-per-view databases
(e.g. ACM) or other expensive sources (I just paid $350 for a copy of
Luke's special function books). Worse yet, the actual algorithm is
both an original algorithm from a paper plus later, possibly never
published, improvements. Even worse yet, even if you understand the
algorithm and read the code you'll find it a challenge.

It is vitally important to understand the details before changing
the system. Axiom has grown beyond the complexity bound where local
fixes can be safely applied without understanding. (Witness the two
incidents in the past related to algebra fixes). Unless these are
caught by comprehensive, system-independent mathematical test cases
(e.g. the Computer Algebra Test Suite (CATS)) they pass quietly into
incorrect results.

Axiom has been recast into literate documents. The point of this
exercise is to draw together the source materials, the "why" 
explanations, the "what" explanations, the test cases, and all
other related pieces of information. This is intended to be written
in a "literate" style so one can just sit down and read the system
like a book, with the important information being introduce when
the discussion motivates it.

In the long term you should be able to read Axiom from cover to 
cover (unlikely given the volume of material) and get an education
in both Axiom and the underlying computational mathematics. When
you decide to improve the system you can enter into a "conversation"
with the prior developers by updating the surrounding discussion as
well as the code, giving your motivations and insights. People should
be able to publish literate documents at a conference which you just
drag-and-drop onto your system (perhaps during their talk) and it
"just works".

Since this is a long term effort, as indicated by the phrase
"The 30 Year Horizon", it will take a while to approach these goals.

Not everyone cares about this. Some would rather continue building
systems "the old fashioned way", or make it different without caring
why it is the way it is. Documenting code is hard and much more time
consuming than just writing code. And few people are willing to
sacrifice their own time now to benefit other people later. So Axiom's
goals are quite controversial. Thus, the forks.

Its not bad blood. It's a difference of goals. Everyone involved
has excellent and admirable motives for what they do.

Well, any browser is fine. But all I have available is Firefox.
I'm not a browser-agile developer so I have no idea what is required
to get new fonts into Opera, or canvas tag support in IE, or graphics
in graphics in Lynx :-)

Hyperdoc was the original help system in Axiom and was way ahead of
its time in the functions it presented. It was designed to allow users
to create new pages, for instance. But over the lifetime of the system
only NAG developed a few new pages. Hyperdoc is difficult to port and
requires an X11 system, special socket handling, etc. Hyperdoc is
special purpose C code I need to maintain.

The new browser front end is designed to allow users to develop new
material in html and javascript, while interacting with Axiom. It
should be completely portable without any special requirements. 
There will be no C code to maintain, although there is new, minimal
javascript/css code.

I did write a wxAxiom (using a fork of the wxMaxima code) but decided
it was yet-another-pile of code to maintain. I like wxMaxima. I just
don't see the advantage of special purpose code when I can leverage
the browser functionality better. I did have to figure out how to
create CSS-based drop-down menus but that's my learning curve issue.

The new browser front end is forming the basis for the Crystal
interface (see the mailing list archives), although this won't
be readily apparent for quite a while.

I believe Martin Rubey (copied on this) has an Emacs mode.
You might consider trying that.

You'll still have all the old interfaces to Axiom, although once
the Firefox front end works I plan to remove all the old hyperdoc
and graphics code. This will significantly improve the ability to
port Axiom to other platforms since most of the issues of porting
have to do with the "portable" C code.

I am just experimenting with Axiom in TeXmacs - more for the nice formatted
output than for anything else, but there is one problem: input and output
aren't numbered.  The input character is just  a little arrow, and there is
no numbering on the output at all.  Can I change this behaviour to include
numbers, so that I can, for example, refer to the output of a previous
command?

Thanks,

So... the idea is that newer security models (I recently installed a
SELinux enabled kernel, which might explain why I've just started
seeing this) make life hard for some types of virus by making a clear
distinction between executable memory and data memory, and by putting
the executable memory in an unpredictable place.  But for some reason,
this makes life hard for Axiom (or the underlying lisp) too; have I
understood correctly?  The two echo commands disable these aspects of
security models for all processes, whereas the setarch method given as
an alternative in the FAQ disables them for one process only, right?

In any case, I've now compiled successfully with the setarch method -
although I have to use setarch -R to run Axiom as well.

Thanks,

Dan

This is bad actually. It reveals some bad design in Axiom internals,
since Axiom is clearly user-land software, it has nothing to do
with system protective features. In plain words, Axiom is broken.

This may come from GCL or other tools, but it makes no difference,
"use another compiler, not the broken one". Being system administrator,
I'm suspicious to users, that ask for reduced security, I don't turn
them off, if I have them already. So do others.
If Axiom requires it, so worse to Axiom, unfortunatly.

Yes, you've understood the problem and the solution correctly.

The SELinux folks seem unable to understand that someone might want
to actually execute code out of the heap or stack memory. Or that
saving and restoring a process might be useful. Both have been
available in lisp implementations since the early days. I can only
conclude that the SELinux developers lack a good computer science
background. I've complained thru several channels without results.
It is yet another case of "better to be safe than useful" from the
security team. Then again, maybe they view lisp as a virus that
needs to be eradicated. Whatever the rational is, I'm sure it is
"classified" beyond my need to know.

An Annoyed Lisper,
Tim

Yes, I agree that under the new definition of the world (that is,
under the restricted terms of SELinux) the lisp implementation is
broken. Under the old definition of the world, the pointless SELinux
"randomized load point" is broken by design, giving only the illusion
of security.

This isn't a point we can debate because there is no middle ground.
You'll always choose "more security" and I'll always choose "getting
work done" so I'll have no more to say on the subject.

It is worth mentioning that that feature has been there in other open source
operating systems, long before it gets adopted by GNU/Linux variants.
It is also worth mentioning that there are Lisp systems (such as ECL)
that do not need this feature,

ASLR isn't SELinux invention.

It isn't silver bullet, but it does prevent from some sort of attacks,
it does improve security, it isn't illusionary nor pointless.

You might be right, if there were absolutely no alternative to
Axiom around, but there are, though not without defects.

Anyway, I believe, this is behind the scope of this list,
and even if I wouldn't think the use of ASLR is useful at all,
I still think, that userland program should not require such
deep system reconfiguration.

I have no idea, but maybe you know better: is there any lisp implementation
(eg. sbcl, ecl, clisp) that does not require this reconfiguration?  In this
case, you can use at least FriCAS and possibly also OpenAxiom, both being
variants of axiom.

Did I understand correctly that gcl doesn't run at all?

I'm using TeXmacs 1.0.5, and (as far as I know) the most recent tm_axiom
file, under Linux.  But in my TeXmacs, Axiom doesn't respond properly to
input commands.  I have to enter a command 4, 5 or more times before I get
an output response, and often the output then is the result of a previous
command.

Does anybody know what's likely to be going on, and how I can fix it?

Thanks,
Alasdair

The command

integrate(exp(-x^2),x=0..1)

produces an expression involving the error function.  But how do I turn this

It seems to be a bug.  Please file it on issuetracker, I'll try to fix it as
soon as possible.   Quite likely, it's just not implemented, in which a quick
workaround is to use romberg:

(6) -> romberg(x+->exp(-x^2),0,1,0.1,0.1,10,100)

   (6)
   [value= 0.7468241328 1242702543, error= 0.4 E -19, totalpts= 2049,
    success= true]
   Type: Record(value: Float,error: Float,totalpts: Integer,success: Boolean)

As Alasdair reported, Axiom doesn't contain an algorithm to compute numerically
the error function yet.

I guess we could use

erf(x)=2/sqrt %pi * sum((-1)^n*x^(2*n+1)/factorial n/(2*n+1), n=0..???)

where ??? needs to be determined by the number of digits needed.

I have no experience in these matters, but I think that should be done
quickly...

Alternatively, we might be allowed to copy-paste a definition used by maxima -
but we need to check the license.

A third approach might be to implement the inclomplete gamma function.

Hi,

I can write (simple) Axiom programs for which the parameters are all
numbers, but what if the parameters include a function?  Suppose I wished to
write a program to, say, solve the equation f(x)=0 by the bisection method,
and I wanted to call it as

bisect(f,a,b)

where [a,b] brackets a solution.  How do I do this?  And in what form does
Axiom like its functions in such a program?

Thanks,
Alasdair

I don't think there is anything that could go wrong.  You can specify an
anonymous function for example with

x +-> x^2-3*x+1

panAxiom doesn't like to do type inference on anonymous functions too much, so
the code will often be interpreted, if you do not specify types:

(1) -> bisect(f, a, b, eps) == (output [a,b]; if abs(fa := f a) < eps then a else if abs(fb := f b) < eps then b else if sign fa = sign fb then error "same sign" else if abs(fz := f(z := ((a+b)/2))) < eps then z else if sign fz = sign fa then bisect(f, z, b, eps) else bisect(f, a, z, eps))
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> (x +-> x^2-3*x+1) bisect(x +-> x^2-3*x+1, -2, 0.5, 0.05)

   
   FriCAS will attempt to step through and interpret the code.
   [- 2.0,0.5]
   [- 0.75,0.5]
   [- 0.125,0.5]
   [0.1875,0.5]
   [0.34375,0.5]
   [0.34375,0.421875]

   (2)  - 0.0018920898 4375
                                                                  Type: Float


Does this help?

A function in Axiom is not so much different from a number. Just do the 
obvious.


Suppose you write a function of type

bisect(f: Float -> Float, a: Float, b: Float): Record(result: Float, 
eps: Float) ==
   ...

where the record stores an approximate result together with an error.

---BEGIN aaa.spad
)abbrev domain AAA Aaa
Aaa: with
     bisect: (Float -> Float, Float, Float) -> Record(x: Float, eps: Float)
   == add
     bisect(f: Float -> Float, a: Float, b: Float): Record(x: Float, 
eps: Float) ==
         -- insert your bisection algorithm here
         r: Record(x: Float, eps: Float) := [f a, b-a]
--------------------------------------------^
-- This is an example of the application of the input parameter f.
---END aaa.spad

Then go to axiom and say:

)co aaa.spad

bisect(sin, 1.0, 2.0)
bisect(cos, 1.0, 2.0)

Does that help?

Thanks, yes that's what I thought.  There was another subtle error which was
causing my confusion, which I've fixed.

Thanks again,

Hi,<br>
<br>
I can write (simple) Axiom programs for which the parameters are all numbers, but what if the parameters include a function? &nbsp;Suppose I wished to write a program to, say, solve the equation f(x)=0 by the bisection method, and I wanted to call it as<br>

A function in Axiom is not so much different from a number. Just do the obvious.<br>
<br>
<br>
Suppose you write a function of type<br>
<br>
bisect(f: Float -&gt; Float, a: Float, b: Float): Record(result: Float, eps: Float) ==<br>
 &nbsp;...<br>
<br>
where the record stores an approximate result together with an error.<br>
<br>
---BEGIN aaa.spad<br>

bisect(sin, 1.0, 2.0)<br>

Hello.

I hope this is the right address.

Has Axiom implemented the LLL-algorithm?

Thank you in advance

not yet, but it would be wonderful if you (or somebody) did.  It would make a
great counterpart for my guessing package...

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenstra?Lenstra?Lov

has a list of implementations.  Maybe it's easiest to take an existing one and
link it to axiom.

Here's my situation:

a:=2^(1/3)+4^(1/3)
p(x)==x^3-6*x-6

I'd like p(a) to return zero; which it doesn't (although p(a::Float) returns
0.0).  How can I do this?

Thanks,

Axiom represents square roots by a mixture of ascii symbols which are
supposed to approximate the square root sign, so that sqrt(2)+sqrt(3) looks
like

    +-+    +-+
   \|3  + \|2

(You'll need to view the above in a monospaced font).  And n-th roots are
even worse: 2^(1/3)+3^(1/4) comes out as

    4+-+   3+-+
    \|3  + \|2

This is just ugly.  Other CAS's in console mode would simply write

      1/2    1/2
     2    + 3

or more simply

     sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)

Can axiom, be coerced to represent n-th and square roots in one of these
simpler forms?

It seems that taste differs: I find the above very beautiful and nice to read.

> simpler forms?

I think that should be doable: look at

(13) -> (2^(1/3))::OUTFORM::SEX

   (13)  (ROOT 2 3)
                                                            Type: SExpression
(14) -> (2^(1/x))::OUTFORM::SEX

   (14)  (** 2 (/ 1 x))
                                                            Type: SExpression

so you could just modify the responsible lines in OutputForm

        root:    $ -> $
          ++ root(f) creates a form for the square root of form f.
        root:    ($, $) -> $
          ++ root(f,n) creates a form for the nth root of form f.


        root a     == [eform ROOT,    a]
        root(a,b)  == [eform ROOT,    a, b]

to your liking, i.e., something like

        root a     == a ** (1/2)
        root(a, b) == a ** (1/b)

You should then recompile outform.spad, and see whether it works.

Martin

What roots do you use : from AlgebraicNumber, Expression or RealClosure.

Can you explain how you understand theses roots ?

I feel (but I can't be sure) that roots in algebraicNumber can be seen=20
as the FractionField over polynoms, with some bugs and inconsistencies.

realClosure only handles real roots, and positive root for even radix.

RCFI =3D> RealClosureFractionInteger
(-2::RCFI)^(1/3) + (2::RCFI)^(1/2) --- is zero.

But there are also surprising results :
(4::RCFI)^(1/3) + (2::RFCI)^(2/3)
I can't get the numeric value, and this domain can't be use in=20
Expression Integer.

You find some don't so funny results in :
http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/285EqualInAlgebraicNumberFails

Other CAS compute over usual complex roots with the first positive argume=
nt.
(-1)^(1/2) =3D e^(%i*%pi)^(1/2) =3D e^(%i*%pi/2) =3D %i.

What roots do you use with your students ? What point of view do you=20
explain ?

The only sens my students have about root is the real root,
they learn the complex ones, but I can't expose AlgebraicNumber.

The exercice I like to solve with axiom :

P(z)=3Dz^4 + 2*m*z^2 + 1, with m real.

solve P(z)=3D0, (with 4 radix expressions)
find limits for the 4 expressions when m is near of +/-1 or +/-%infinity
and plot with 4 colors the 4 roots. You get a circle and the 2 axes.

You may change z^4 and z^2 by z^6 and z^3, and +1 by -1, for other=20
pretty plots.

Fran=E7ois



Have a nice day !

F.

I'm starting a sequence of posts about Axiom, with the beginner in mind.  I
thought I'd do this over several posts, rather than as one huge post.

Anyway, you can see the first post at
http://amca01.wordpress.com/2008/05/25/an-introduction-to-axiom-1/

Your comments would be most welcome.

cheers,

I am trying to write the following (tex expression of)
variable df into a text file.

(20) -> df :=D(exp(x) + 2*x,x);
(20) ->
                                                    
Type: Expression Integer
(21) -> df
(21) ->
$$
{e \sp x}+2
\leqno(21)
$$

                                                    
Type: Expression Integer


I could use the command File(Expression Integer) as
described in 
section 9.24 of the Axiom book. 

Alternatively, I am trying to use the command TextFile
:

f1: TextFile := open("df.txt", "output");

writeLine!(f1,df);

close! f1;


But I get an error complaining  the second parameter
 in writeLine!(*,*)
should be of type String.
How to convert df into a String ?


Thanks advance for any assistance!

I am using  version axiom-mar2008.

Is there an easier way, in Axiom, of drawing two curves on the same set of
axes than with the getGraph, putGraph and makeViewport2D commands?  It would
be nice (for me!) simply to be able to enter, say

draw([sin(x),x-x^3/6],x=-2*%pi..2*%pi)

and have the graphs of both functions in the list drawn on the same axes.
But Axiom doesn't seem to support this syntax.

Thanks,
Alasdair

Alasdair,

You could try something like this:

draws(s,p,t) == (_
  vp:TwoDimensionalViewport:=viewport2D(); _
  for i in 1..#s repeat putGraph(vp,getGraph(draw(s.i,p,t),1),i::PI); _
  makeViewport2D(vp) _
)

draws([sin(x),x-x^3/6],x=-2*%pi..2*%pi,[])

draws([sin(x)^2, cos x], x=-3..3, title=="Example 2")

Regards,
Bill Page.

The Bill draws command is very pretty.

Interal functions for drawing with axiom can plot very nice graphs.
You can run /src/input/graphics.input.

I test an *.input for for plotting field solutions (x(t),y(t)) about ODE=20
with Runge-Kutta 4 method. The final plot is right.

I'd prefer a syntax close from other CAS.

Do you think I can write a "interface" Domain for this purpose ?
or must theses functions be in the axiom kernel ?

Addition forms of the 'draw' operator should best be added here:

  src/algebra/draw.spad.pamphlet

It should be simple to include a version to allows plotting of lists
of functions.
