Hi,

Just install Axiom Sept2005 release :-)
A simple question, how can I ask Axiom to
run a pre-written script ?

I will be good if I can simply pass the script from
command line, eg "axiom myscript".

Thanks
KC

> Hi,

This is an old release. The Axiom team do not distribute tarballs of the
stable release (Gold) but instead distribute the source code via GNU
Arch from http://www.axiom-developer.org or via CVS either from
Sourceforge or Savannah. These repositories are updated at each release.
For more information see http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources
but you have already read this page I believe. The actual version of
Axiom is "Axiom (September 2006)" which corresponds to "patch-50" in the
CVS log. It seems to me that this release has some problems with
graphics but I can be wrong.

> A simple question, how can I ask Axiom to

The file extension of your script must be .input and it can be processed
with the system command ')read' so issue ')read myscript.input' for
example. In Hyperdoc see 'Setting->Commands-> )read' for more
information.

You can use 'AXIOMsys < myscript' and eventually redirect the output to
a file. You will probably need to set the environment variable AXIOM,
see the the 'axiom' script (I don't know where your version of Axiom is
installed).

Hello,

  Consider the following code snipet:


     )abbrev domain T T

     Decl := Record(name: Symbol, type: T)

     T(): Public == Private where
       Public ==> with
         type: Symbol -> %
         decl: (Symbol, %) -> Decl
       Private ==> add
         decl(n,t) == [n,t]


The SPAD compiler complains on the definition of decl with the
following message

       initializing NRLIB T for T 
       compiling into NRLIB T 
       compiling exported decl : (Symbol,$) -> Decl
    ****** comp fails at level 2 with expression: ******
    error in function decl 

    (|construct| |n| | << t >> |)
    ****** level 2  ******
    $x:= t
    $m:= T$
    $f:=
    ((((|t| # #) (|n| # #) (|t| #) (|n| #) ...)))

       >> Apparent user error:
       Cannot coerce t 
          of mode $ 
          to mode T$ 

It looks like SPAD believes T is different from % within the
definition of T.  Am I correct?  Why is that?

Thanks,

-- Gaby

Why would you consider the type T itself to be known in the scope
where the value of Decl is computed?

Perhaps you meant to write

      Decl :=3D Record(name: Symbol, type: %)

which seems to compile as expected?

Bill Page.

Because inside the definition of T(), % is supposed to refer to the
domain defined, i.e. T.  Notice that the only thing that is needed to
be known is the type name.

|       Decl := Record(name: Symbol, type: %)

Yes that is correct. But you are asking SPAD explicitly to evaluate
Record(name: Symbol, type: T) outside of and *prior to* the definition
of T(). It seems that in the normal mode of operation of the SPAD
compiler this is out of context for T. (But see how this can be
changed below.)

I think it is instructive to see what Aldor says about this
construction:

Decl :=3D Record(name: Symbol, type: T)
^
[L4 C1] #7 (Error) `Decl' is used in a type, so must be constant,
  and so cannot be assigned to.

After correcting the definition, Aldor compiles this thing without
complaint:

-------
#pile
#include "axiom"

Decl =3D=3D Record(name: Symbol, type: T)

T: Public =3D=3D Private where
  Public =3D=3D> with
    type: Symbol -> %
    decl: (Symbol, %) -> Decl
  Private =3D=3D> add
    decl(n:Symbol,t:%):Decl =3D=3D [n,t]
    type(x:Symbol):% =3D=3D x pretend %

------

Even more exciting is the fact that using the $bootStrapMode flag
discovered by Waldek the same code is compiled by SPAD without
complaint!

-------
)lisp (setq |$bootStrapMode| t)
)abbrev domain T T

Decl =3D=3D Record(name: Symbol, type: T)

T(): Public =3D=3D Private where
  Public =3D=3D> with
    type: Symbol -> %
    decl: (Symbol, %) -> Decl
  Private =3D=3D> add
    decl(n:Symbol,t:%):Decl =3D=3D [n,t]
    type(x:Symbol):% =3D=3D x pretend %

-------

I wonder why '$bootStrapMode t' is not the normal default mode of
operation for SPAD? Is the generated code less efficient?

As far as I know, in SPAD the Type % is not resolved statically at
compile time instead it remains a placeholder for "this domain" in
whatever context it occurs. (In contrast to Aldor.)

>=20

I don't know. Maybe you need to extend your example to actually
do some computation which tests the semantics and/or take a look
at the generated Lisp code.

This mode is used to compile certain domains that cannot be
compiled any other way. I believe it was applied to PI and NNI
but memory fails me. 

I should not be used in general.

That is interesting.

See for example:

 http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxBootStrap2

and in particular the Lisp code at:

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/images/T.NRLIB/code.lsp

You are right. I did not notice last night that *if* I do
this SPAD compile in the same Axiom session in which I have
previously done some other compiles, then we get this error
message. See:

 http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxBootStrap

where I did the SPAD compile after the Aldor compile. However the
compile does work if it is the only thing compiled during a session
(on the same page). See

 http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxBootStrap2

This seems to be a serious bug.

Why would you expect to be able to tell the database via
)abbrev that Decl is a category?

>=20

Do you mean that '$bootStrapMode t' asks the compiler to only compile
"headers"?

Here is the actual Lisp generated by Gaby's (modified) example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxBootStrap2

Please excuse my indentation below which is only approximate.

(/VERSIONCHECK 2)=20

(DEFUN T NIL
  (PROG NIL
    (RETURN (PROG (#0=3D#:G1407)
      (RETURN (COND

        ((QUOTE T)
          (UNWIND-PROTECT
            (PROG1 (CDDAR
              (HPUT |$ConstructorCache| (QUOTE T)
                (LIST (CONS NIL (CONS 1 (|T;|))))))
              (LETT #0# T T))
  (COND ((NOT #0#) (HREM |$ConstructorCache| (QUOTE T))))))))))))=20

(DEFUN |T;| NIL
  (COND (|$bootStrapMode| (VECTOR (QUOTE (T))
     NIL NIL NIL NIL NIL))
  ((QUOTE T)
    (|systemError| (LIST (QUOTE |%b|) (QUOTE T) (QUOTE |%d|) "from"
(QUOTE |%b|)
    (QUOTE "/var/zope/var/LatexWiki/390581243-25px001.spad")
    (QUOTE |%d|) "needs to be compiled")))))=20

(MAKEPROP (QUOTE T) (QUOTE NILADIC) T)=20

-------

Note especially "needs to be compiled". :-)

How does one "compile second time in normal mode"? Do you
mean just re-compile it without the '$bootStrapMode t' flag?
In that case is the first compile with this flag only generating
type information to be used for compiling downstream modules?

Regard,
Bill Page.

Bill -- 

Thank you for investigating this further.

My understanding of "==" in SPAD is that it is a "delayed evaluation",
whereas in Aldor it is a "constant declaration".  Of course, I'm not
interested in non-constant type Decl, but I'm wondering how
do you reconcile those two interpretations?

If my understanding is correct, this problem touches upon the fact
that the SPAD compiler does not know (at the moment) how to properly
resolve recursive declaration/definitions of types.  Is that correct?

Since, under the hood, almost everything is a pointer, why is the
compiler having trouble admitting recursion?

At the language semantics level, is the declaration in error?
If yes, it makes the language less regular and unintuitive.

I see the trick with $bootStrapMode, but I would think that is
essentially a hack to work around a bug in the compiler.  I would be
very much interested in laying down the semantics and see how the
compiler could be convinced to do the Right Thing.


If I have time today, I'll investigate the possibility of augmenting
the compiler to use the identity coercion from % to T, when T is the
current domain. 

Thanks!

'$bootStrapMode t' means there is no "real" code. You need to compile
second time in normal mode to compile executable part.

Concerning the example above, I tried to get executable code from it,
but I already have problems at first declaration. More precisely,
consider:

)abbrev domain DECL Decl

Decl == Record(name: Symbol, type: Symbol)

I get:

   >> System error:
   Caught fatal error [memory may be damaged]

regardless of $bootStrapMode. The same if change the above to:

)abbrev category DECL Decl

Decl == Record(name: Symbol, type: Symbol)

If I try:

)abbrev category DECL Decl

Decl: Category == Record(name: Symbol, type: Symbol)

I get:

   Internal Error
   Error while instantiating type Category

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

AFAICS Spad types are global and separately compiled. Recursive
dependencies are painful when you want separate compilation.

Also, during type checking compiler traverses varoius links (references)
between types -- on has to be careful to avoid infinite loops
(and when loop is detected how to give sane semantic to the loop).

I am not sure if just telling "recursive type definitons are OK" is
a good idea.  Some restrictions on recursion are clearily needed,
and with such restrictions old-fashioned techniqe of forward
declarations may work well.

In short yes. ATM I do not understand all consequences of $bootStrapMode,
but I belive that intended use was to compile once with $bootStrapMode
set to t (or perhaps do a few iterations to find a fixpoint) to resolve
cyclic dependencies between types and then re-compile with $bootStrapMode
set to nil.

I don't think so.  This is recursive definition in the *same unit*.

Check out Haskell, or  the excellent book
"The implementation of Functional Languages", by Simon Peyton Jones.

certainly some restrictions may be needed; I don't believe the current

AFAICS:

1) The only way to introduce a new type constructor in Spad is via
   category or domain declaration
2) Each category or domain is a separate compilation unit for Spad
   compiler (even if they live in the same file).
3) Recursive dependencies spanning compilation units are painful.

If you want to change Spad compiler to allow bigger compilation units,
I would support such motion.

Spad compiler seem to use very simple (almost naive) algorithms. You
need smarter approach to handle cycles (smarter algorthms are known,
one just have to implement them...)

The important thing from my perspective is not what how easy we can

But hey, my implementation background is that of making is easy for

That is not a problem -- that is why this is a research project, as

Hi group,
I just started to learn axiom and is running it under linux. I got
following error when I tried to build a Fibonacci number. Anyone could
show me what I did wrong?
Thanks,

Try a 
)trace SYSTEM 
before anything else

You could try 
)set functions compile off
which will not use the compiler for functions. It seems some misconfiguration 
is present with your C compiler.

Mine says 
cc1: error: unrecognized command line option "-fwritable-strings"
and I have 
gcc version 4.1.0 (SUSE Linux)
installed

The gazonk*.c file is a temporary file created by the Lisp
(gcl) compiler. gcl compiles Lisp to "C" and then calls gcc
to create the object file.

Hello! Welcome to Axiom. :-)

You are not doing anything wrong. I also get an error when I
try your definition, although it is a different error:

   Compiling function p as a recurrence relation.
(4) -> p(3)

   >> System error:
   The function |*1;p;1;initial| is undefined.

--------

I am using an experimental version of Axiom compiled from the
build improvements branch on August 30, 2006.

The way you wrote the defintion should work but you have found
a bug in Axiom. Thank you for your report.

BTW, what version of Axiom are you using? What version of C
compiler is installed on your system?

Try it this way:

(1) -> p:NNI->NNI
                                      Type: Void
(2) -> p(0)==1
                                      Type: Void
(3) -> p(1)==1
                                      Type: Void
(4) -> p(n:NNI):NNI == p(n-1)+p(n-2)
   Function declaration p : NonNegativeInteger -> NonNegativeInteger
      has been added to workspace.
                                      Type: Void
(5) -> p(3)
   There are no library operations named p
      Use HyperDoc Browse or issue
                                 )what op p
      to learn if there is any operation containing " p " in its name.
   Cannot find a definition or applicable library operation named p
      with argument type(s)
                                   Integer

      Perhaps you should use "@" to indicate the required return type,
      or "$" to specify which version of the function you need.
   AXIOM will attempt to step through and interpret the code.
   Compiling function p with type NonNegativeInteger ->
      NonNegativeInteger

   (5)  3
                                                        Type:
PositiveInteger

Notice that Axiom is trying to do something special here. It
recognizes this as a recurrence relation. The way I wrote the
definition above avoids this "special treatment".

I do not understand why you are getting syntax errors in the
generated "C". This does not happen on my system - although
there is another problem which prevents the definition of p
from working.

This looks like you might be using a version of gcc that is
not compatible with the version of gcl Lisp on which the
version of Axiom that you are using is based.

Bill Page.

Good suggestion! Note: This option only works properly on
versions of Axiom after patch-49, circa September 2005. Prior
to that some function definitions in the interpreter required
'compile on'.

Yes, I think so.

What version of Axiom are you using? I think Axiom compiled with
newer versions of gcl should not have this problem.

Hi Themos,
)set functions compile off fixed the problem.
Thanks,

Somehow you're using g++ instead of gcc as your C compiler.  That can
only attract troubles.

No problem with Gold (patch-50):

(1) -> )set fun comp on
(1) -> p(0) =3D=3D 0
(2) -> p(1) =3D=3D 1
(3) -> p(n) =3D=3D p(n-1)+p(n-2)
(4) -> p(3)
   Compiling function p with type Integer -> NonNegativeInteger=20
   Compiling function p as a recurrence relation.

   (4)  2

Hi group,
What is the prpper way to integrate the PDF of normal distribution?
I tried:
(4) -> integrate(x/(sigma*sqrt(2*%pi))*exp(-(x-mu)**2/(2*sigma**2)),x=%minusInfinity..%plusInfinity)
(4) ->
   (4)  "failed"
                                                Type: Union(fail: failed,...)
But if I give a value to sigma, then it works:

(9) -> sigma:=10
(9) ->
   (9)  10
(11) -> integrate(x/(sigma*sqrt(2*%pi))*exp(-(x-mu)**2/(2*sigma**2)),x=%minusInfinity..%plusInfinity)
(11) ->
              +---+
          2mu\|%pi
   (11)  -----------
          +-+ +----+
         \|2 \|2%pi
                    Type: Union(f1: OrderedCompletion Expression Integer,...)

Is it possible for axiom to work without specify a value to sigma?
Thanks,
Ming

Hi,

I noticed that Axiom does not support Hyperdoc under Windows.
This gives rise to a serious issue; all Axiom documentation refers
to the Hyperdoc for a description of functions. Clearly, Windows
users thus have *NO* documentation on Axiom's functions.

Can the Hyperdoc documentation be converted to PDF?
That would be an enormous help.

Regards,
Paul

Paul,

There are two books available in the src/doc directory.
One is the original Axiom book and the second is a tutorial.

On Windows that's actually

  C:\Program Files\axiom\mnt\windows\doc

And there is a link to the Axiom Book in this directory available
from the Start menu.

I vaguely remember that somebody managed to have HyperDoc on MS-windows, given
that an X-server is installed?

Hi All,

I know of the Axiom book and the tutorial, but that does not contain what
I want; an overview of types and a list of functions for all types.
Everywhere I looked, I was directed to hypertex, which is not available on
windows.

So let me refrase my initial question: can somebody convert the hypertex
documentation to a general purpose format which is readable on all platform=
s?
Candidate formats are:
-pdf
-html
-info

Without this documentation it *REALLY* is impossible for Windows users to q=
uickly explore
Axiom's functions and make use of them. Currently, Windows users can only u=
se what they can
find in the examples or the book, which is not complete.

Regards,
Paul

I *STRONGLY* advise you to try something different: install Xming and try to
get Tim Daly to give you instructions on compiling Axiom with HyperTex on
MS-Windows. Possibly Bill Page also can help. If you mangage to get HyperDoc
running and you provide some documentation, I'd propose you for a bounty!

If neither of them does, please send mail again, and I'll try to do something
myself.

Alternatively, if you are keen on programming and know some perl, then maybe
Ralf Hemmecke would be able to show you how to modify his AllProse to get
something similar to HyperDoc. But I guess this is more difficult.

The great thing about hyperdoc is that you can enter a category, say, for
example, Ring, then press on a button labelled "Domains" and you will get all
Domains known to Axiom that are Rings. I.e., Integer, Polynomial Integer,
Fraction Integer, PrimeField, and so on. 

In my opinion, that's the best way to discover Axiom.



Martin


PS: I just remember, Kai Kaminski has converted some pages to html. But again,
I don't think that's the way to go.

I actually made a start trying to compile Axiom using MSYS/MingW but got
stuck. As an experienced MingW user I know how much trouble it can cost
to solve all these issues (I'm currently trying to build GCC cross-Arm
tools under MSYS/Mingw, it does *not* work out of the box and needs=20
lots of patching). As I also have other projects lying around
which I like to finish, I currently do not have time to go along this road.=

How would that be different from any format that allows hyperlinking?
Hypertex is IMHO quite obscure, and I cannot see a big benefit for using it
over standard solutions which are widely supported.

I do not ask to ditch Hypertex, but just another option to help all
Windows users out there.

I'm actually quite fluent using all kind of source-to-source conversion
tooling, so what I can imagine is that I'll write a small conversion
utility that converted the hypertex files into another format.

I would like to have *any* such documentation, so I totally agree here.

Without going in too much discussion; I still do not understand what benefi=

Hypertex has over other more standard solutions, certainly given that curre=

Windows has *no* Hypertex support.

I don't think translating the HyperDoc contents into ALLPROSE is not so 
easy. And ALLPROSE is probably also not the right way to do it. I guess, 
you mean AldorDoc. Together with Christian Aistleitner I have agreed 
upon a few (additional) LaTeX commands to tag type names and function 
names. That lives basically in aldordoc.sty which is distributed with 
ALLPROSE. What is still missing is a program AldorDoc, that takes 
library code and transforms it into a nice format from which .dvi, .pdf, 
.html etc. could be generated. That program is still missing.

Anyway as a first start, I'd like to ask, where I should look for the 
sources of the contents of HyperDoc.

Could someone give a rough overview of the process how the content is 
produced? If I remember correctly there was some format to write 
hyperdoc pages, but what does that have to do with the API description 
of functions/domains/categories of Axiom. I guess the latter is 
generated from the ++ comments in the .spad files, right? Then what is 
the process from ++ to hyperdoc?

Right. ALLPROSE cannot do that. There are other tools necessary.

We once had a draft of such a conversion to simple HTML done by
Kai Kaminski, one of the axiom developers, however the work on
this version of the browser source is not complete. Unfortunately
that doesn't help you immediately, but it should be re-assuring that
it is indeed possible.

Your help and encourage to do this work is much appreciated.

Building Axiom under MSYS/MingW is quite easy. See:

Great. Maybe you can add Axiom on Windows to your list of project. :-)

For a different point of view, let me say that I almost NEVER use
hyperdoc. I find the user interface clumsy, unreliable and of limited
use. I prefer instead to search and read the Axiom sources directly
and to use )display and )show commands in the Axiom interpreter.

I agree. One complication is that a lot of the intereting information
about Axiom is actually stored in a data structure called the Axiom
database (daase). Hyperdoc uses this information to navigate. It is
not straight-forward to access this using just a web browser - but
of course there are several different ways in which this could be
made available to a standard browser.

Using Xming is a possibility but I thing most Windows users would
find the X-windows based interface quite foreign.

Great! Maybe you can discuss this with Kai Kaminshi who has
already done some of this work.

I think discussion is a Good Thing. You can't have "too much".
:-) But I agree with you. I would very much rather have a standard
web browser interface with functionality similar to Hyperdoc.
Hyperdoc was "neat" in it's day (circa 1990) but today it looks
ugly and awkward. But of course that is just my opinion...

Actually there is a version of hyperdoc for windows but it uses Xming.
Plus it does not connect to Axiom. Axiom and hyperdoc communicate using
an intermediate program called sman which does not yet run on windows.

All of the information in the databases can be extracted with a function
called asq (e.g. ask). This is a simple C function that should run on
Windows. It can extract and print any information that the database 
knows about functions.

Now that I think about it, it should be straightforward to connect
asq to a browser since a C function can be used as a cgi-bin program.
It might take a little fondling to make the output display well in html
but that's not conceptually hard.

I'll look at it.

Yes. asq is available from the MSDOS command line on windows.

The point is that the list of domains which are of a certain category is
created dynamically. If I start a fresh axiom session, compile a spad file
which contains some new Ring, say MyWonderfulPhantasticRing it will be listed
by HyperDoc automatically.

Of course, I'm all in favour of replacing HyperDoc itself with something that
runs on any browser. Ralf's ALLPROSE is a HUGE step in that direction. But as
of now, it doesn't connect to axiom. (Although I have some patches that go in
that direction)

Lots of software out there feature a built-in web server so that a browser can 
act as the control. Axiom could do the same for the documentation, system 
settings and other automation features.

The asq function was intended for non-X platforms so we could
still deliver the information without running Axiom.

I'm not much of a cgi-bin hacker but it seems to me that 
some simple C hacking and a command line option would enable
the output to be placed in html tables which could somehow
allow point-and-click for additional lookups. Memory fails
me but there is some way of constructing POST or GET around
items in tables so that you could click on table entries.
I'll have to look at my html reference book for details.

Indeed if the constructed html could pass algebra expressions
back to the cgi-bin then it could run axiom, capture the output,
and send it back.

The source is in src/etc/asq.c.pamphlet. There is some documentation
but I guess I thought the structure of the databases as random access
files was "obvious". I'll clearly have to update the documentation :-)

I wrote some detailed documentation about the database file format
somewhere on this list a couple weeks ago. I'll try to find it and
add it to the literate documentation of asq.
