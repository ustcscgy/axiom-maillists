Hi,

  I know that somewhere deeply embedded in the hieraachal structures
of Axiom's bed site there is a list of recherch papers related to
Axiom.  However I'm unable to find a link to that list on the
front-page.  Is it just me?

Hello,

I'm new to axiom (using 3.9 on Gentoo Linux) and would like to use it with TeXmacs.

As others have found, TeXmacs does not support draw() and in spite of
following the suggestions on the axiom web site regarding hacking
tm_axiom.c I cannot get it to work: no graphics, no output in TeXmacs.

Given that I am using TeXmacs 1.0.4 I'm wondering if anyone has better
experience with a more recent (TeXmacs) version.

Thanks,

Roger Mason

Maybe you try http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/FAQ.

6.  Where can I find articles related to Axiom and Aldor?
Look at http://portal.axiom-developer.org/refs/articles

Hi Tim,

  What is the status of noweb with respect to Axiom installation?
That is, noweb is built solely to permit extraction of source code and
documentation. Is the built binary ever intended to be installed when
Axiom is installed?  Can I for sure assume that it is a build utility
only? 

Thanks,

-- Gaby

Tim --

  The variable LISP lacks documentation in the toplevel
Makefile.pamphlet.  What is its purpose?  Lisp file suffix?

once the meta files disappear from the sources we won't need to build
a local version of noweb. however, if it isn't available on the local
system we will still continue to build it in the near term.

noweb is built so we can extract sources. we've had discussions about
changing the syntax so it is pure latex as in
  \begin{chunk}[chunkname]
  \end{chunk}

  {\use [chunkname]}
but i haven't spent any time hacking latex macros to do that yet.
if we take this step then there is no need for 'noweave' at all.

we've also had discussions of doing the notangle in lisp which 
would eliminate the need for noweb at all.

both efforts are related and likely to occur in the future.



i've been watching your automake efforts in silence (mostly because
i'm completely work-buried) to see how the debate turns out.

you're welcome to construct an automake facility any way you'd like
but keep in mind that literate documentation is the long term key.
you made the comment that automake files are self-documenting and
i have to disagree strongly. (try handing them to a student and
see if they're written for the human or the machine.)

i think that no matter what choices you make they'll eventually
evolve into another form (as you're evolving my weak attempt at
configure scripting) so i'd concentrate on getting it working and
documented and then worry about getting it politically correct.
running code wins the debate every time.

we really need the automake function. my configure script just
won't cut it.

OK; this finally got through.  Glad to see it there.
As you can see, it predates the current debate.

>  The variable LISP lacks documentation in the toplevel

There are 3 kinds of "lisp" files in the Axiom build process.
The first are the "clisp" files. These are common lisp files
generated by the boot compiler. The second are the "lisp" files.
These are hand written common lisp code. The third are the "lsp"
files. These are files generated by GNU Common Lisp. The LISP
variable is used to name the third kind of files as this may
change when the underlying common lisp is changed.

I've updated the Makefile.pamphlet documentation with this information.

Tim --

  Do we know why don't systematically use this

    It turns out that we can successfully build GCL on many more systems
    if we set the [[GCLOPTS]] to build a local [[BFD]].
    <<GCLOPTS-LOCBFD>>=
    GCLOPTS="--enable-vssize=65536*2 --enable-locbfd --disable-dynsysbfd \
             --disable-statsysbfd --enable-maxpage=256*1024"

everywhere, when we think we must build GCL?

only that it needs to be tested. not everything works everywhere.
for instance, i've renewed my freebsd struggle and GCL won't build
there due to 
   "error: Initializer element is not constant"
which happens nowhere else. so i have to figure out what random
combination of switches will fix this (i HATE C).

I asked because recently you had a problem building GCL and it turned
out that Camm's recommandation was to enable local bfd for GCL.  I
believed you reported success with that.

The error "error: Initializer element is not constant" looks to me
like a programming error than anything else -- I agree with the
assessment that C's notion of "constant expression" is primitive, but
that is not the point here...

In this release I had to split the 'linux' build from the 'fedora5'
build due to a problem with libXpm. I've been trying to figure out
a way to re-merge them, so far without success.

In my conversion to Autoconf, I just call the Autoconf macro
AC_PATH_XTRA.  It has knowledge to find the "right" include and
library paths for X11 and set them in X_CFLAGS and X_LDFLAGS
respectively.  That way, there is no need to worry whether the lib64
path should come before or after.

Ah, also in my rewrite, there is only a single Makefile.  Variables
are instantiated at configure time.  

The only issue that I need to solve (but I'm not worried about it
right now), is how to find "optimization" flags for C compilers other
than GCC/gcc.  I know the existing Makefiles special cases all of them
it knows about.  I'm however skeptical that they have been used
successfully recently to build Axiom.  It looks to me that all major
systems Axiom will run on have GCC...

It's not that simple unfortunately (or maybe it is and I just
don't understand it). For instance, the current conflict between
the "linux" branch and the "fedora5" branch is libXpm. Linux 
uses libXpm.a from /usr/X11R6/lib and fedora5 doesn't seem to 
have that file. Fedora5 wants -lXpm but when I feed THAT to the
"linux" build it fails thus:

           /tmp/axiom49/obj/fedora5/lib/bsdsignal.o -L/tmp/axiom49/obj/fedora5/lib -lspad  -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXpm  -lX11 -lm -L/tmp/axiom49/obj/fedora5/lib )
linking /tmp/axiom49/mnt/fedora5/bin/htadd
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XDefaultScreen'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XCreateImage'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XDefaultVisual'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XFreeGC'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XUngrabServer'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XGetImage'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XFreeColors'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XParseColor'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XGrabServer'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XQueryColors'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XAllocColor'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XGetGeometry'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XDefaultColormap'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XDefaultDepth'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XPutImage'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XCreatePixmap'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XCreateGC'

so I have:
    linux:  -l/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a
  fedora5:  -l/usr/X11R6/lib -lXpm

I'm not sure how autoconf resovles that issue because the failure
occurs during linking. I suppose you could construct a special case
test for this. I'm just constructing the same case using the AXIOM
variable.

Again, it's not that simple. Axiom builds on linux systems using GCC
but I tried to build Axiom on FreeBSD again last night and it fails
due to complaints from GCC. Specifically the complaint I mentioned
about "Initializer element is not constant".

I still don't know what that is about nor how to fix it.

And we haven't even mentioned the MAC yet :-)

I strongly disagree with your remark.

I don't understand why you want to say explicit "libXpm.a".  Any make
rule that mentions that explicitly is bound to fail at some point.

| 
|            /tmp/axiom49/obj/fedora5/lib/bsdsignal.o -L/tmp/axiom49/obj/fedora5/lib -lspad  -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXpm  -lX11 -lm -L/tmp/axiom49/obj/fedora5/lib )
| linking /tmp/axiom49/mnt/fedora5/bin/htadd
| /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XDefaultScreen'
| /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XCreateImage'

| /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XCreatePixmap'
| /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.so: undefined reference to `XCreateGC'

These symbols are defined in X11.  So I highly suspect an ordering
error of the library you specify.

| 
| so I have:
|     linux:  -l/usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a
|   fedora5:  -l/usr/X11R6/lib -lXpm

I don't think there is any conflit; just a bug in the way the LDFLAGS
are specified.  I don't think there should be any explicit mention of
libXpm.a.  That looks bogus to me.

Yes, but both FreeBSD and MAC use GCC, right?

I'm not pretending Axiom is simple -- certainly it is not.  But, That
has nothing to do with the remark that all major platforms will run on
have GCC.

I originally reported the bug (without patch) and mention that with Xorg
>=3D 7.0 libXpm.a is, if it is available, (always ?) in the /usr/lib
directory (for example in Debian testing/unstable and in Ubuntu Dapper).

Sorry, bad manipulation...=20

So that will not work if you use directly /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a for
"linux".

As I said, nobody should be specifying "libXpm.a" explicitly.

Attached is an email I  previously sent 4/2006.  Most likely it doesn't contain anything new (or
possibly relevant).
I haven't been following the conversation in detail;
 and have had distractions from participating.

I am doing copies to all since I understand that the axiom-mail has enforced new reply policies.

Finally got around to getting it running.
Below is how to get a working version; except....
The text entry in the browser window doesn't seem to work and doesn't
report errors(:  and htsearch permissions aren't set to execute.  There
is probably a make error I missed.  If somebody doesn't give me a hint I
will save the make output and examine it. I usually do that, but
neglected this time since it's so strange.
BTW: presume I have forgotten or mistyped something; you will have a
happier life.

******************
I can package this up in a bash script if wanted.  But I hope most of it
will go away.  The Makefile.pamphlet will be updated; and the libXpm.a
will go into the release.
In other words look around a little before using these instructions;
make sure they make sense at the time and date you are using them.

If somebody wants I can edit the Makefile.pamphlet to retarget X11 paths
for FC5.

********************

To get a functioning axiom on Fedora 5 as of 4/10/06
*****************
root
libXpm.a is missing from the DVD install
get libXpm from
http://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/fedora-linux-core/5/source/SRPMS/
do a build and install.  Of course it goes to different place,
Apparently they changed to X11R7 and put it in /usr/local/lib/
for now:
ln -s /usr/local/lib/libXpm.a  /usr/X11R6/lib/libXpm.a


go to some convenient directory and
make sure to mv any old axiom; a bad previous compile gummed up the cvs

cd axiom

make install

I realize this does not answer my question at all.

Take AXIOM/src/scripts/document for example.  It contains direct
reference to notangle and noweave, built while building Axiom's.
However that script is installed along with noweb...

Oddly, it seems that Tim did not understand your question.

Your initial assumption is correct. For Axiom, noweb is
*only* a build utility. It is not required for running
Axiom. It should not be installed when running the Axiom
'make install'. All we should be "installing" are the
files necessary to use Axiom -- not to build it. As usual
the build directories will remain intact after the install
and would continue to be available for Axiom development
(if desired).

Regards,
Bill Page.

I would say the answer is: For an ordinary user of Axiom noweb is not 
needed.

However, sooner or later a user wants to extend Axiom and he/she should 
do that in a pamphlet style. So here noweb is needed.

I see 4 versions
a) bootstrap Axiom (need autoconf and friends)

b) building Axiom from source (need configure, noweb, etc.; no autoconf)

c) use a binary Axiom (a .deb or .rpm package, no sources needed if the 
.dvi/.pdf files are provided for the Axiom mathematics library, 
Aldor/SPAD compiler would be needed for compiling interactive functions 
in the interpreter)

d) extend Axiom (needs at least c) and an Aldor compiler and noweb; no 
sources of the build machinery of Axiom is needed)

Many thanks!

So, to sum up, can I assume that the installation of scripts files in

I don't see any need to distinguish between c) and d). The
C compiler is needed in any case by lisp. The Axiom binaries
for linux all assume that gcc is present. In the case of
Window we actually have to install parts of the MinGW gcc
distribution in order to support the SPAD compiler.

Bill Page.

Well, if you are just a user of Axiom, you don't really need noweb. That 
was the distinction.

Yes. So we may need to distinguish between two kind of Axiom
**developers** - Type 1: those who simply modify and create
new library code (Aldor or SPAD), Type 2: those who will actively
work with the underlying source code, including BOOT and lisp.

Maybe we want to call developers of type 1 "advanced users"?

Anyway, you are right both 1) and 2) will require ongoing
use of noweb to support the development of literate programs.

Bill Page.

Indeed.

I also suspect that Axiom has not been built recently with any

I would say "you should not need noweb."  Note the "conditional".

no, please!

Let's keep it simple.  We have Axciom developers, and axiom users.
Axiom developers are those who work directly on Axiom's source files.
Axiom users are those who install Axiom for their use.

Axiom is complicated, rightly or wrongly perceived so.  We don't want
to give the impression not only Axiom developers are also complicated
but Axiom users must be complicated too.

Hmm, for the moment, developers + users is OK for me. But as I said, a 
user who writes a new library and extends Axiom need not have any 
knowledge about how Axiom is build. However, in some sense you are 
right, extension of the Axiom library makes him a 'developer', in 
particular if he plans to give the sources to the Axiom project. 
Otherwise we don't care anyway.

Maybe I just wanted to say: if someone wants to extend the Axiom library 
there is no need to download all of the Axiom sources. A few things 
would be enough. But I guess, it's too early to think about that.

Yes. Actually I'm arguing that an Axiom user who just launches axiom
for calculator-type computations, or an Axiom user who develops a
hyper-Groebner basis library for this purpose or colleagues are on the
same footing from my perspective.  However they become Axiom
developer the day they starting modifying Axiom sources.

You're probably right.

I need to get this Autoconf stuff move on.

Did you test build-improvements branch recently?

In general I agree but we should return to Gaby's question
about: mnt/linux/src/algebra. It seems to me this definition
of Axiom users means that noweb is "in" and these .spad files
are "out". If we distribute mnt/linux/src/algebra at all, then
it should probably contain the original *.spad.pamphlet files,
not the notangle'd files.

Resolving the following issues:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/144

and

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/116

might mean modifying both ')sh' and hyperdoc to point to the
appropriate <<chunk>> within the appropriate *.spad.pamphlet
file. And modifying ')co to allow a reference to a chunk name,
like this:

)compile manip.spad.pamphlet \
   )chunk <<package FACTFUNC FactoredFunctions>>

This command would require notangle functionality. If we could
assume a noweb-aware text editor (e.g. emacs) then the ')ed'
command could also be appropriately extended. And Tim's 'document'
script also makes sense in this context.

But of course this makes some assumptions about the actually user
interface, i.e. that it will remain something like the current
command line interface. These issues might be resolved differently
in a more advanced interface (e.g. a web browser-based user
interface).

>=20

I am not sure if we really "don't care", nor that it is "too
early" to think about this. I believe that Tim Daly's vision
is that literate programming methodology should be embedded into
Axiom at a deep level. It is supposed to be the medicine that
prevents the code rot that has occurred in the Axiom library
over the last 20- years from happening again over the next
20+ years.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I would recommend that we always keep a working command line interface,
whatever else may become the "default".  The command line is portable
across platforms, represents the least demand in terms of support
libraries, and is usable over even terminal sessions.  A session of
axiom captured with script on unix can be viewed and printed anywhere,
without worry about math fonts, browsers, readers, etc. - I think this
is a good fallback to have in low resource situations.

I would say that we should distribute the pamphlet files, and alter the
compile command to assume them.  If we don't require pamphlet files
people will not be inclined to create them - I would much prefer that
Axiom itself enforce the need to be literate, at least insofar as is
workable without being overly intrusive.  I think compile assuming a
pamphlet file is a good idea.  We can always provide a less convenient
compile_spad_file command or some such if there proves to be a need.  A
lisp level notangle ability will presumably remove the external
notangle program requirement, and the command can be adjusted
accordingly.

However, irrespective of that, I would say that whatever assumptions
are made now to get us onto the autoconf bandwagon are the ones to go
with.  We have a LOT of work to do to get Axiom to be a literate
program not only technically but in a true sense (e.g. content other
than source code in those literate documents) and there will be time to
hash out those issues.  I have been poking just a little at interp and
the job of understanding and rewriting it is a massive one.  Much more
so than I originally thought (does anybody know what Exposure group
data is for?) and very important for a variety of longer term projects
to be viable.  Eventually I think the interp rewrite will greatly
simplify things in general, but we can't wait for that and for now
whatever gets us moving gets my vote.

Cheers,
CY

I was first thinking that we need that .spad files. But hyperdoc does in 
most cases not find the corresponding .spad file anyway. So I think we 
should distribute .spad.pamphlet and try to fix the links. The fix 
might, however, take some time. Is there somebody knowledgable enough to 
  look into such a fix?

That is true. The same (incorrect) result is returned by
the ')sh' commmand and by 'asq'.

>=20

Good question. I do know that the solution must involve the
Axiom database (.daase files) in some way since that is where
the structural information about domains etc. is stored.
But we need also to extend the database with a mapping of
module names into *.pamphlet and <<chunk names>>. This is
problematic since by the time the database files are built
the information about the pamphlet names is gone.

So I supose the first step would have to be to extend the
compile command to include <<chunk names>> as I suggested
before

  )compile xxx.spad.pamphlet )chunk <<yyy>>

and also to capture both of these names in the NRLIB files
for the module. Then we can extend the database to load this
additional information. And the build would have to be changed
to use the above form of the compile command.

As Clifford Yap and Tim Daly have said a few times on this
list, that would mean providing a replacement for notangle,
built-in to the Axiom compiler (and also the interface to
Aldor). To do this we would need to write some Boot code (or
lisp as a last resort ;). Or I suppose that it would also be
possible just to call the noweb notangle as a system command
from within the Axiom code. The last option might be less
portable but easier to implement.

Regards,
Bill Page.

That sounds like a nice idea to me. Though finally, I think, it is a 
more complicated to extend Axiom. For simple extensions such a )compile 
is OK, but one might have several files and then one always needs to 
remember in which order these files should be compiled. Then it calles 
for Makefiles or a better Axiom-Extension support.

Anyway, our source files are pamphlets and we should keep it that way 
and promote the "literate idea".

I think the following, saved as executable in $AXIOM/lib does what you
want. Should be easy to modify to work with pamphlets instead, I guess.

Thanks to this wonderful suggestion the new Maxima interface
on MathAction is looking pretty good! :)

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxMaxima

I modified the texmacs-maxima-5.9.2.lisp code a little to emit
XML-style tags instead of the TeXmacs weird control characters.
The resulting protocol is much easier to handle in Python.

So thanks to Bob and the original authors: James Amundson and
A.G. Grozin, this was a lot easier to do than I thought. :)

Please give this a try and report any problems via IssueTracker.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I am not sure whether I'd like the syntax change. And I quite doubt that 
in the near future someone is writing a LaTeX package that handles that 
stuff. For example:

\begin{chunk}{MyCode} % The chunkname should not be optional!!
false
\end{chunk}

\begin{chunk}{MyChunk} % The chunkname should not be optional!!
apply(x: Boolean, y: Boolean): Boolean == x and y;
(x: Boolean)/(y: Boolean): Boolean == x and y;
MyCode: Boolean == true;
use: Boolean := true;
b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/\use {MyCode} % How should that be parsed???
\end{chunk}

Doing that kind of programming in TeX is extremely difficult, since in 
one place \ must be taken literally and in another it is considered as a 
character that starts commands. If you want the code also reasonably 
readable as a LaTeX source, I don't think that going the LaTeX way is 
the right choice.

Well, one option would be to redefine << and >> in LaTeX to deal with 
chunks. But then you could also take noweave. And second, noweave has 
some options that would be nice to have like '-index'.

I've already written a *restricted* version of notangle in Perl.
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-08/msg00153.html
Surely, we probably also want the notangle option

-L'#line %L "$<"%N'

which relates the line numbers of an extracted .as file to the original 
line numbers in the .as.pamphlet source.

I haven't used fancyvrb, so I am not completely sure whether my 
reasoning is correct. But I have looked into the verbatim package. 
You'll probably believe that there are quite some tricks to recognise 
the \end{verbatim} in a stream of characters that TeX is actually 
supposed to output literally.

I bet even fancyvrb cannot correctly do a line like

b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/\use {MyCode}

You could write

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/\use {MyCode}
\end{Verbatim}

That would probably correctly expand "\use {MyCode}", but the backslash 
after / is followed by a space and thus is expanded to output a space 
character. So in the output you would probably see something like

b: Boolean := MyCode / use/<MyCode>

where I wanted

b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/<MyCode>

One must escape the first \ somehow in such a case. Doable, but it makes 
the code harder to read.

Of course you could write

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=|\{\}]
b: Boolean := MyCode /\ use/|use {MyCode}
\end{Verbatim}

and it would come out nicely, but then you have to make the 
corresponding tangle command a bit smarter to recognise | as the 
character that introduces TeX commands inside that Verbatim environment.

Anyway, fancyvrb seems to be quite smart, even though it does not solve 
the problem that in the output of the above code I would like see 
"Boolean" turn into a hyperlink to the definition of Boolean. 
Fortunately, the documentation of fancyvrb refers to the listings 
package for doing such fancy "pretty printing". But I have not yet 
looked into listings more closely.

Well, I'm not a TeXnician, nor a LaTeX expert.  I just find the
package fancyvrb amazing, flexible, and happen to prefer it over other
alternatives I've tried.  Given the sort of things it does, I thought
it might have faced similar issues, but again I'm not a LaTeX expert.

The 'document' script is intended to centralize all of the information
necessary to extract information from a file in various ways within the
axiom system. It is ultimately intended to support the drag-and-drop
feature I'm working on as well as a )compile command in Axiom. Many
(but not all) of the Makefiles have been changed to use it.

Axiom needs noweb in a running, finally installed system.
It does not need it now but it will need it shortly.
Axiom's compile command needs to know how to extract the
spad code from pamphlets.

But that script must certainly be improved.

1) It does not call bibtex.
2) It does not call makeindex.
3) It ALWAYS applies latex twice where sometimes 1 application would be

Oh, another person who does not like "document" very much...

I can understand Tim's idea of a drag&drop system, but it implies that a 
new "algebra idea" is completely coded in ONE file. It's not like the 
"changeset" stuff. And for the Axiom build system it would be better to 
have not just a collection of Makefiles that you document (and read) 
separately. It is really hard to get an overview of what relates to 
what. I would rather like to have a document that describes the build. 
But I guess that document consists of several Makefiles and a 
description of their relations.

'document' is a script intended to collect the usual document handling
functions which standard options. i put it there so i can use it to
build files during make and later to build files during development.
it's unlikely that you would use it yet.

That's the purpose of book volume 4, the developer's guide. 
Understand the process, write it as a chapter, and add it to the guide.

It stands in my way for having a more structured build system.

When in the cyle design-code-build-test; I don't need all those dvi
that document insist on building.  I have configure generate my
Makefiles, but document want to generate its own.

document was a necessary step to get Axiom to the state where it is
now.  But now, it either has to give the way or mutate significantly.
Most of the functionalities offered by document are superceded in my
work. So, unless, it mutates and offers me something I need and I don't
have now, it must be retired.

eh? again i'm confused.

'document' is like 'tar', it handles a pamphlet file format with options
just like 'tar' handles gzip files.

'document' is intended to be the primary command used throughout axiom
to manipulate pamphlets, including drag-and-drop. it also handles 
issues of "NOISE" which is a top-level make function. if you say

   make NOISE=

you will see all of the latex output. without the NOISE= it will
not output the latex. the makefiles don't need to know how to
suppress noise.

there is no reason that the makefiles need to know about the
command sequences necessary to translate pamphlet files just like
there is no reason that makefiles need to know how to gunzip tar files.

why would a single command which centralizes all of the knowledge
of how to translate a pamphlet to tex, dvi, pdf, spad, etc be an issue?

Here is the content of 'document' (silver branch, same as gold branch).

    if [ "$latex" = "" ] ; then
      echo document ERROR You must install latex first

     exit 0
    fi
    if [ "$#" = "1" ]; then
     FILE=`basename $1 .pamphlet`
     $tangle -t8 $FILE.pamphlet >$FILE

     rm -f $FILE.aux
     exit 0
    fi
    echo "document [ -o redirect ] pamphlet"


As you can see, document insists on LaTeXing a file, which, as I said,
when in a design-code-build-test mode, I'm not interested in.  It just
wastes my time.  I rather have a separate [hase for building .dvi
files than trying to conflate everything together.  Maybe that mode
will be only for developers, but then document is not my solution.

Futhermore, my Makefiles are generated from configure using .in files
as inputs (the infiles themselves are generated from pamphlet files)
-- I don't want document to touch them, it simply it not sophisticated
enough to understand what is going on.

On the build-improvements branch for example, here is the sequence of
events:

  * developer edits Makefile.pamphlet.
  * developer produces Makefile.in from pamphlet files

  * users invokes ./configure
  * configure reads in Makefile.in, compute values for some
    placeholders  in Makefile.in (Makefile.pamphlet) and instantiate
    Makefile (in the build directory) reflection configure options,
    build and target systems.

document can't understand that and handle that.

BTW, document has been modified (on the build-improvments branch) to
the point where it can use either system supplied noweb or noweb from
aXiom.  And document is also generated by configure.

i work in a literate style all the time now. every few lines i change
i completely notangle-compile-test-noweeave-latex-xdvi as a single
process. that way i know that the program still works, still TeXs, 
and the code and text are in sync.

literate programming is a fundamental change in the way one thinks.
programs are written for people, not machines so TeXing the file is primary.

surely you can't be suggesting that people still write naked code files....

you are, in fact, working as a developer so i'd hope that all of your
new makefile machinery is pamphlet files.  and the design principles
should come first, as in the top level Makefile so the next generation
can follow the religion.  so why wouldn't a greatly improved
'document' command be primary? 

a two-pass process would allow a latex typo to stop the system build
very late in the process whereas it logically should occur the first
time the file is used. 'document', with the appropriate options,
should completely handle the file, no?

it's hard for me to consider 'document', the primary command for handling
pamphlet files, as unnecessary.

I think you misundertood.  The issue is not that of removing TeXing.
The issue is that of *delyaing* TeXing to another phase.

The TeXing is pointless when it is not needed.

| literate programming is a fundamental change in the way one thinks.

By now, I think I know that psaulm by heart :-)

[...]

And surely, I'm not suggesting that; right?

they are.  What I'm saying that I work in various modes -- just like
various people work different.  They are modes where the TeXing is
just a pure waste of time for no reason.

In another mode, where full build is necessery to check that the
system is working, TeXing is mandatory.  No single size fits all.

| and the design principles
| should come first, as in the top level Makefile so the next generation

| 'document' command be primary? 

because, it is secondary.  When I'm in a position where I'm satsified
with the build system, I will at how document can be improved to do
what it should be doing with the build system.  document is not an end
in itself.  It is tool.  I need to explore the landscape before I know
how to manufacture the tool to suit my needs.

| a two-pass process would allow a latex typo to stop the system build
| very late in the process whereas it logically should occur the first

| should completely handle the file, no?

TeXing and compiling SPAD, C, or LISP are two aspects of checking that
source files we check in the repository are "correct".  At the moment
they are entangled.  I'm saying that that entaglment ignores the
important fact that at various stages of development not all two
aspects need to be done simulatenously at the same time.  However,
they must be done before modification happens in the repositories.

Hello,

Ok, so why not modifiying 'document' itself, like in:

--start document--
#!/bin/sh

REDIRECT=""
FILE=""
gaby_mode=no

while : ; do
    case "$1" in
        "") break;;
        -o)
            REDIRECT=$2; shift;;
        -gaby-mode)
            gaby_mode=yes;;
        *) 
            FILE=`basename $1 .pamphlet`;;
    esac
    shift
done

latex=`which latex`
if [ "$latex" = "" ] ; then
  echo document ERROR You must install latex first
  exit 1
fi

if [ "$FILE" = "" ] ; then
  echo document ERROR You must provide a file name
  echo "document [ -o redirect ] [ -gaby-mode ] file.pamphlet"
  exit 1
fi

tangle=$AXIOM/bin/lib/notangle
weave=$AXIOM/bin/lib/noweave

$tangle -t8 $FILE.pamphlet >$FILE

if [ "$gaby_mode" == "no" ]; then
    $weave -delay $FILE.pamphlet >$FILE.tex
    if [ "$REDIRECT" == "" ]; then
        $latex $FILE.tex 
        $latex $FILE.tex
    else
        $latex --interaction nonstopmode $FILE.tex >$REDIRECT
        $latex --interaction nonstopmode $FILE.tex >$REDIRECT
    fi
    rm -f $FILE~
    rm -f $FILE.pamphlet~
    rm -f $FILE.log
    rm -f $FILE.tex
    rm -f $FILE.toc
    rm -f $FILE.aux
fi
exit 0
--end document--

Really, I don't believe the issue is that of "gaby mode".  
document is doing too many things at the same time.
There was a comparison with tar earlier.  However, tar does many
things at the same only if you give many options :-).

I would like to see:

   --all                # do "everything"
   --weave              # extract tex files, don't compile
                        # probably with more options, e.g. --delay

   --tangle             # extract source code, probably with more
                        # option, e.g. --tabs=8

Those are what I currently use; you're welcome to expand and submit as
a patch and pray Father Tim accepts it :-)

Hi,

   The SPAD compiler accepts and happily compiles this:

   )abbrev category FOO Foo

   ++ A Foo is something we can foo with.
   Foo(m : ($, $) ->$) : Category == SetCategory with
     ++ A Foo has a foo
     foo : ($, $) -> $ 

Is it a feature or a bug?  [Similar Aldor code is rejected]
Notice that attempt to use Foo later as in

    )abbrev category BAR Bar
    ++ A Bar is something we can bar with
    Bar(m : ($, $) -> $) : Category == Foo(m) with
      ++ similarly a Bar has a bar
      bar : () -> $

results in a "system error"

   initializing NRLIB BAR for Bar 
   compiling into NRLIB BAR 
 
   >> System error:
   Value stack overflow.


Thanks,

-- Gaby

Why is this a mail to axiom-mail instead of axiom-developer?

Nobody can say whether bug or feature, because there is no strict 
definition of the SPAD language.

because it is about use of Axiom.  I'm wearing my Axiom user hat here.

still, we have an Axiom library written in something...

I'll appreciate an explanation of whether it is supposed to have any
at all.
