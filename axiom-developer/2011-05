Morning,
  I am attempting to make axiom on a MacOs HFS that I believe was
formated as case-insensitive.
The make always fails with the following error.
cp: ...../axiom/mnt/macosxppc/doc/spadhelp/ASP12.help and 
...../axiom/mnt/macosxppc/doc/spadhelp/Asp12.help are identical

thanks.

I do not see ASP12.help, only Asp12.help.
The only reference to that name is in books/bookvol10.3.pamphlet


Axiom, in general, has had all of the files except the
help files moved to lowercase only names. The help files
mirror the actual names of the domains so they need 
mixed cases.

Can you give me a traceback of where this might happen?

When Axiom starts it lists a version number which is a
(month year) form. What version are you using?

Axiom has been case-insensitive since around 2008.

Since TeX is turing complete and allows macros,
would it be possible to create a set of macros
that are not ambiguous? For instance, an integral
macro that specifies the limits and differential
variable?

\integrate{0}{\infty}{r}{sin(\theta)}

In this case it seems to me that the latex macros
would closely approximate the actual linear input
to the CAS.

Tim:

The file "book-index.xhtml" contains 3 entries for "eq?",
all for "Section 9.18 EqTable".
There are in fact three text statements in in that section
containing the string "eg?".

I generally believe that an index would contain only one entry
per page for any given word.  Does the index generation mechanism
for Axiom inteneded to function that way?
Or does it tolerate duplicates per page/section?

The file book-index.xhtml was a contributed document.
Axiom does nothing but copy it at build time.

The same issues arose when the Axiom project moved from SVN
to git. Under SVN we created user-related branches so various
ideas could be explored. Unfortunately these branches were
not kept to the single idea but became essentially alternative
implementations with many "features". That was clearly a project
management failure on my part.

At one point in the project we attempted to merge the branches
back into the main line. Unfortunately the development on these
branches had gotten much too complex as many ideas were 
being explored in each branch. 

A many-month effort was made to cherry pick changes that could be
merged. But cherry picking changes, while technically possible,
led to social problems as the branch maintainers wanted every
change accepted. This was not possible among the several branches,
of course. This was especially hard as there was no documentation
about the changes, making conflicts impossible to resolve.

What the "great merge" exposed was that the branch maintainers
had goals that conflicted with the stated project goals. Working
in their own branch allowed them to pursue these conflicting
goals quietly. Ultimately this led to two forks.

The lesson to learn is that branches should be based on single ideas
(e.g. swap NIL and T semantics), not on people (e.g. Bob's branch).

Another lesson: code should be merged or rejected very quickly (e.g
less than 2 weeks) otherwise the branch owner gets too attached
to their code rather than the idea so rejecting the idea is taken,
unintentionally, as a rejection of the person. Even great developers
(which Axiom had) generate ideas that get rejected.

The third lesson is that it should be up to the branch owner
to provide "diff -Naur" patches that can be smoothly applied
(actually "git diff" patches). After all, the branch owner knows the
branch code. These patches should all relate to a single feature. 

The trunk maintainer should not try to understand-and-cherry-pick.
That way lies madness, anger, and forks.

A fourth lesson is that there should be no "public" branches anymore.
These should all be local. git allows branches to be pushed and pulled
among subsets of developers without public branches.

Move the trunk now. Let the branches provide focused diff-Naur patches.

Moving from SVN to git is a great idea. I highly recommend it.

Since the xhtml is all static text it should be a simple
task to just read it once and eliminate any duplicates.
Just make the changes you want, send me a diff-Naur file,
and I'll apply them.
 
The author is Arthur Ralfs.

OK: so we have an unmaintained, probably machine generated,
and apparently incomplete but otherwise useful piece of the documentation.

Any memory of who or how it was generated generated?

I had to create something similar for another project and
had a degassing step in there which appears to have omitted here.
If memory serves correctly degassing can actually be done with
simple unix commands only.

But that would bypass the incompleteness issue.

The C++ thing that I have in specialized form might be
generalized to create a component for Axiom that would
work from the entire documentation source since the pamphlets
are really now TeX/Latex which was its targeted input.

Eugene,

I did the xhtml-mthml version of the book several years ago from the
latex/tex using regular expressions in emacs.  It was quite laborious.
Because a lot of the latex is hand written and the tex output from axiom
has been hand modified a lot of the conversion had to be done by hand.
I always thought it would be nice if it could be generated automatically
when building axiom but I think to do so would require regularizing the
latex in the book pamphlets.  Maybe then requiring any future additions
to the book to be run through a validator.

I have been contemplating writing special case latex macros
that supply unambiguous parsings of the input expressions,
such as
\integrate{0}{\infty}{\sin{x}}{x}
which are essentially just the Axiom input parameters
written in custom latex. This would allow direct generation
of both the Axiom input and the .dvi output.

Tim,

The thing I did with a tex manuscript got off the ground
by turning something like
\integrate{0}{\infty}{\sin{x}}{x}
into
\integrate 0  \infty  \sin x   x
which consists of primitive exhaustive vocabulary elements.
The specalized tex/latex control sequences that you
are considering would just join everything else in the processing.

Axiom now displays examples of use as well as type information:

)d op pop!

There are 4 exposed functions called pop!:
  [1] ArrayStack D1 -> D1 from ArrayStack D1 if D1 has SETCAT
  [2] Dequeue D1 -> D1 from Dequeue D1 if D1 has SETCAT
  [3] D -> D1 from D if D has SKAGG D1 and D1 has TYPE
  [4] Stack D1 -> D1 from Stack D1 if D1 has SETCAT

Examples of pop! from ArrayStack

a:ArrayStack INT:= arrayStack [1,2,3,4,5]
pop! a
a

Examples of pop! from Dequeue

a:Dequeue INT: dequeue [1,2,3,4,5]
pop! a
a

Examples of pop! from StackAggregate

a:Stack INT:= stack [1,2,3,4,5]
pop! a
a

Examples of pop! from Stack

a:Stack INT:= stack [1,2,3,4,5]
pop! a
a

These are part of the ++ comments for the operations with a
special ++X prefix. For instance, in ArrayStack, the pop! operation
comments are:

  pop_! : % -> S
    ++
    ++X a:ArrayStack INT:= arrayStack [1,2,3,4,5]
    ++X pop! a
    ++X a

The )d op parsing routine looks for these special ++X examples
and includes them in the output.

This is a simple change to the display routine since the ++
comments are stored in the database. All the author has to
do is prefix example lines in the comment with ++X

I think this is a useful documentation feature. I would hope
that the other systems would pick up this change. We can all
benefit from the additional documentation.

Sorry for the delay and thanks for the bug report.

It took a while to reproduce as I had to create the Fedora machine.
I am rebuilding the binary at the moment to see if it still exists.

The code works on the latest version of Axiom which will be 
released by the end of this month. 

In any case, I will let you know what I find.

I have fixed this problem and built a new fedora image at
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/downloads/axiom-fedora-mar2011-bin.tgz

I've also added this example as a regression test to the
latest test suite.

Thanks for the bug report.

Eugene,

Since I haven't heard from you I set out to address your
concern about eq? appearing multiple times on the same page.

I have looked at the book-index file and I think that Arthur's
original version is reasonable. The notion of a "page" in html
based documentation isn't clearly defined. The fact that some
of the references point to adjacent items is a non-issue since
the user would not notice that fact.

Actually bookvol5 has a 175 page index.
But something I did broke the index generation function.
I'll look into it.

I've been busy writing a paper due tomorrow.

I agree with you that a "page"
is an ill defined notion in xml/html.
That the target page of the index page (not the index page itself)
has multiple nearby entries is no issue to me.

With the multiple references to the target page,
it is nice to be pointing near the particular reference.
But, since there no way, from the index entries,
to tell which is the most appropriate reference,
I don't much see need for more than one entry.

But that just my view and given that the current
index was essentially hand generated I don't
intend to go further in that direction for the moment.

Rather I'm starting to look at something that has
no index at all, that is, bookvol5.pamphlet.

Further thoughts?

The May 2011 release is complete.
The sourceforge, savannah, and github websites are up to date.
The axiom-developer.org website will be up to date shortly
with sources and binaries.

May 2011 Release

This release involved more work treeshaking of the compiler and
interpreter. Argument naming conventions were normalized to improve
the documentation and clarity.

Time was spent proofreading the books and reducing or eliminating
latex warnings. Missing index files were fixed and errors in the Jenks
book were fixed.

The website has been updated to make Arthur Ralf's book available
from every page. The website is being rewritten to be IPv6 enabled.

Doug Telford was added to the credits.

IIRC the index was not generated by hand, rather there's markup, 
something like \index{eq} in the original TeX, from which the index was 
generated programmatically.

Arthur:

I think these were the comments that gave me the
impression that much of the index effort was by hand.
The use of latex \index was what I expected.
Things are now clearer.

Thanx and cheers,
