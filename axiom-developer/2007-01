I think you forgot to tell the number of nodes for the above number. ;-)
Well, it is clear that you don't want to reserve so much memory at once. 
But I don't have any idea how to do this nicely. That is the reason, why 
this mail also goes to axiom-developer.

The problem is in aldor-combinat we have huge structures which are 
generated on the fly and generated on demand in a "Generator" structure.
So we have a function

   structures: SetSpecies(L) -> Generator %

The problem now is, if I call "g := structures(s)" inside an Axiom 
session, one cannot simply step this generator in a form like

   for x in g repeat {...}

Is there somebody knowing the internals of Axiom (and maybe Aldor) who 
could help to make such a "for" statement work?

First, H-A-P-P-Y new YEAR 2007 for everybody !

A *.spad file can cantain conditionals as 
...
 if R is Integer then
   aFunction x == a definition for integer
 else 
   aFunction x == an other definition
...

But the function << aFunction >> must be an exported function.
If aFunction is a local function in the package the test is always false.

So some packages export a lot of local functions, by example elemntry.spad.

[axiom] )sh EF

all the ixxx functions might be inner functions because 
they are defined after a conditional.
The file elmentry.spad explains :
          -- the following should be local, but are conditional

I can't find any advice about it in the 30-year book. 

Where is the problem ? What can aldor do ?
Export too much functions complicate the use of axiom.

You can test this very short package for expression 
-------------------------------------------------------------------
)abbrev package TRYCOND TryConditions

TryConditions (R, F): Exports == Implementation where
  R : Join (OrderedSet, GcdDomain)
  F : Join (FunctionSpace R, TranscendentalFunctionCategory)

  Exports ==> with
    result    : F -> F
    expResult : F -> F

  Implementation ==> add
    iResult : F -> F
    iResult x == cos x
    expResult x == cos x 
    if R is Integer then
      iResult x == sin x
      expResult x == sin x 
    result x == iResult x
----------------------------------------------------------------------
test 
result (sin x)                     -- sin : right
result (sin %i)                    -- sin, I wait a cos 
expResult (sin x)                  -- sin : right
expResult (sin %i)                 -- cos : right

That is interesting. But it only says that you cannot assign a Generator 
object to a variable (I believe). However, try the following code with

%axiom
)co aaa.as
l: List Integer := [2,3,5]
neg gen l

---BEGIN aaa.as
#include "axiom"
PkgA: with {
	gen: List Integer -> Generator Integer;
	neg: Generator Integer -> List List Integer;
} == add {
	gen(l: List Integer): Generator Integer == generator l;
	neg(g: Generator Integer): List List Integer == {
		import from List Integer;
		[[x] for x in g];
	}
}
---END aaa.as

Hello Francois and Happy New Year to everyone.

I am not a SPAD-expert, but let me try on your little code chunk.

> expResult (sin x)                  -- sin : right
> expResult (sin %i)                 -- cos : right

First, to me that is bad code in the sense that "==" should define a 
constant. What you do is you define the constan iResult and if "R is 
Integer" you re-define the "constant". Looks ugly, better would be

if R is Integer
  then expResult x == sin
  else expResult x == cos

Aldor has a "local" keyword, but I have not tried to actually 
conditionalize the definition of a local constant.

My construction above for exported functions is certainly treated in a 
special way by the compiler.

What you want is

result(x: F): F == if R has IntegerNumberSystem then sin x else cos x;

right? So why don't you write it?

Ok, now everytime "result" is called the expression

   R has IntegerNumberSystem

will be evaluated. Since that is a waste of time, you could say

RhasINS: Boolean == R has IntegerNumberSystem;
result(x: F): F == if RhasINS then sin x else cos x;

which is only a bit test. But probably still one test too much.

If I look at elemntry.spad, it seems that all the functions starting 
with ii... should be defined in a separate package. Let's name it 
MyTrigFuns(R, F). MyTrigFuns should export all these ii... functions. 
and define them as in ElementaryFunction(R,F). ElementaryFunctions in 
turn should have all the i... and ii... stuff moved to MyTrigFuns and at 
the end always say something like

    evaluate(opexp, iiexp$MyTrigFuns(R, F))

My problem would be how to avoid the exports of MyTrigFuns to be visible 
in an Axiom session. But maybe

)unexpose MyTrigFuns

works.

Otherwise you could define MyTrigFuns locally inside the "add" of 
ElementaryFunctions. So no exports of i... functions would be seen in an 
Axiom session since they are hidden inside the "add". Aldor would allow 
such a local domain construction. I have however no idea whether SPAD 
can do this.

I hope I could help a little.

Ralf

I have not been able to find any documentation about the use
of "is" in the Axiom interpreter. For example:

(1) -> [1,2,3] is [a,b,c]

   (1)  true
                                  Type: Boolean
(2) -> a

   (2)  1
                                  Type: PositiveInteger
(3) -> b

   (3)  2
                                  Type: PositiveInteger
(4) -> c

   (4)  3
                                  Type: PositiveInteger
(5) -> [1,2,3] is [x,y]

   (5)  false
                                  Type: Boolean
(6) -> x

   (6)  x
                                  Type: Variable x
(7) -> y

   (7)  y
                                  Type: Variable y
(8) -> [x,y] is [1,2]

   Pattern matching is only allowed on lists.

(9) -> )di op is
   is is not a known function. AXIOM will try to list its functions
      which contain is in their names. This is the same output you
      would get by issuing
                             )what operations is

(10) -> [[1,2],[3,4]] is [p,q]

   (10)  true
                                  Type: Boolean
(11) -> p,q

   (11)  [[1,2],[3,4]]
                                  Type: Tuple List PositiveInteger
(12) -> p

   (12)  [1,2]
                                  Type: List PositiveInteger
(13) -> [[1,2],[3,4]] is [[p1,p2],[q1,q2]]

   (13)  true
                                  Type: Boolean
(14) -> p1

   (14)  1
                                  Type: PositiveInteger
(15) -> [[1,2],[3,4]] is [[x1,x2],y0]

   (15)  true
                                  Type: Boolean
(16) -> y0

   (16)  [3,4]
                                  Type: List PositiveInteger
(17) -> ...

Does anyone know where I can find out how to use "is" in the
interpreter? Where is this defined in the the interpreter source
code? Is this operator also defined in the SPAD language?

Regards,
Bill Page.

What you are looking for can be found in i-spec1.boot and i-spec2.boot
("upis" in your case ("up" - "is")). The "real" job is in i-analy.boot.
This is where the function "upis" is called . See the function bottomUp
and more precisely the line that contains:

(fn:=3D GET(opName,"up")) and (u:=3D FUNCALL(fn, t)) =3D> u

Greg

PS: Don't ask me how to use "is" in the interpreter, I don't know :-).

Hello

what is wrong with the following code:

----------------------------------------------------------------
#include "axiom"

extend List (R:Ring) :  with {
           sumlist:(ll: %)->R;
} == {add {
                 sumlist ( ll: %) : R == {
                         s: R :=0;
                         for x:R in generator ll repeat  s:= s+x;
                         return s
                 }
         }
}
----------------------------------------------------------------

it compiles fine, but then I get

(1) -> sumlist [1,2,3]
  1) ->
    >> System error:
    Caught fatal error [memory may be damaged]

this happens on debian stable, Axiom+Aldor from April 2006,
(axiom-aldor-20060621.tgz as available on axiom-developer.org).
I was wondering how to implement a "generic" sumlist function.

thanks
Franz

You should have read previous posts. Axiom does not understand "extend".

The following code does what you want. Just say

%axiom
)co sumlist.as
sumlist [1,2,3]

---BEGIN sumlist.as
#include "axiom"
SumPackage(R: Ring): with {
     sumlist: List R -> R;
} == add {
      sumlist (l: List R): R == {
          s: R := 0;
          for x in l repeat  s:= s+x;
          return s
      }
}
---END sumlist.as

Have fun
Ralf

Current version of complex argument (in gaussian.spad.pamphlet) is
responsible for multiple bugs (15, 47, 184, 293, 314 and a few wrong
answers in mapleok.output).  The patch below uses more complicated
but correct formula for complex argument.

The existing formula assumed that x has positive real part.  But
for integration it is typical to have constant imaginary part
and real part which changes sign. So the existing formula produced
spurious jump discontinuities.

With the patch Axiom gives now correct answers for most such problems.
Unfortunatly, correct answer is more complicated and ATM Axiom is
unable to simplify it.  Because of this some test outputs (especially
in mapleok.output) got bigger -- I am still checking if all new
results correct.

In principle we could try to determine when the old formula works
correctly -- we should be able to determine in which a constant
lives and for many functions it is also possible to prove that
the function has constant sign.  OTOH such machinery belongs to
other packages.  In fact we have various sign finding utilities
which work on expressions, but:
- sign finding may be pretty expensive
- it is not clear if such utilities are applicable to all
  domains allowed as arguments to complex (which probably
  means that we need to add a maze of conditionals choosing
  correct version of 'argument') 

Also, currently integrator converts exponentials and logarithms
to trigonometric and arc trigonometric functions by taking
real part of the answer -- this looks wrong for me.

Anyway, the patch follows:

I have already written that due to incomplte simplification we
may get zero divisors in Expression Integer.  Below an easy
example that multiplication in Expression Integer is nonassociative
(or, if you prefer, a proof that 1 equals 0):

(135) -> c1 := sqrt(2)*sqrt(3*x)+sqrt(6*x)

           +--+    +-+ +--+
   (135)  \|6x  + \|2 \|3x
                                                     Type: Expression Integer
(136) -> c2 := sqrt(2)*sqrt(3*x)-sqrt(6*x)

             +--+    +-+ +--+
   (136)  - \|6x  + \|2 \|3x
                                                     Type: Expression Integer
(137) -> (1/c1)*c1*c2*(1/c2)

   (137)  1
                                                     Type: Expression Integer
(138) -> (1/c1)*(c1*c2)*(1/c2)

   (138)  0
                                                     Type: Expression Integer

BTW, a similar looking constant expression throws an error:

(139) -> 1/(sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)+sqrt(6))

   >> Error detected within library code:
   univariate: denominator is 0 mod p

But this is not just an Axiom problem. Mathematica does 
the same thing, with a slight variation on input:
a1 = Sqrt[2]*Sqrt[3 Sqrt[5x + 7] + 6] - Sqrt[6Sqrt[5x + 7] 
+ 12]
a2 = Sqrt[2]*Sqrt[3 Sqrt[5x + 7] + 6] + Sqrt[6Sqrt[5x + 7] 
+ 12]
(1/a1)*a1*a2*(1/a2)  (* answer 1 *)
(1/a1)*(a1*a2 // Simplify)*(1/a2)  (*answer 0, Simplify is 
needed to get this *)

The problem seems to be the lack of a canonical form for 
radical expressions and an algorithm to reduce expressions 
to canonical form. A related problem is lack of algorithm 
to test zero. Another is denesting of a nested radical 
expression. These problems have been studied by Zippel, 
Landau, Tulone et al,  Carette and others.

You also can use reduce. E.g. reduce(+, [1,2,3])

Yes, but be careful. The documentation in Collection(S) (aggcat.spad) says:

reduce: ((S,S)->S,%) -> S
   ++ reduce(f,u) reduces the binary operation f across u. For example,
   ++ if u is \axiom{[x,y,...,z]} then \axiom{reduce(f,u)} returns
   ++ \axiom{f(..f(f(x,y),...),z)}.
   ++ Note: if u has one element x, \axiom{reduce(f,u)} returns x.
   ++ Error: if u is empty.

Franz has a bit more information on S. He knows that it is at least a 
Ring, so "sumlist []" will return 0. Otherwise one would have to use

reduce: ((S,S)->S,%,S) -> S
   ++ reduce(f,u,x) reduces the binary operation f across u, where x is
   ++ the identity operation of f.
   ++ Same as \axiom{reduce(f,u)} if u has 2 or more elements.
   ++ Returns \axiom{f(x,y)} if u has one element y,
   ++ x if u is empty.
   ++ For example, \axiom{reduce(+,u,0)} returns the
   ++ sum of the elements of u.

I was confused.
I read the excellent aldor user's guide and neglected the fact, that
it is written for the standalone version of aldor rather than the axiom 
version. Is there a similar manual for axiom+aldor other than
http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap18.html ?
Is this the right mailing list anyways?

I started a project in axiom some time ago (computations in group rings 
with arbitrary coefficient rings, which is not possible in gap, tedious 
to impossible in maple/mathematica and very simple in axiom). Since the 
old compiler will disappear at some point I decided to switch to aldor
starting by a translation of what I had already written and stumbled on
the summation problem.

Now to the real questions.
I was aware of reduce but did not use it because I actually wanted to 
write a "generic" sum function for "all" possible structures, including 
finite streams etc. on which reduce does not work.
The only way I found in axiom was

   last complete scan(0,+,somestream)

which looks rather insatisfactory.
What could be axiom equivalents of AdditiveType and 
BoundedFiniteDataStructureType ?


Then SumPackage(L:BoundedFiniteDataStructureType,R:AdditiveType)
with essentially the same code would do just any possible case.

Dear list,

I installed the binary Axiom+Aldor package from
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/Mirrors?go=3D/public/axiom-aldor-2006062=
1.tgz&it=3DAxiom+with+Aldor+binary
according to the instructions on
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomBinaries
on my gentoo amd64 system.

Compiling the following short snippet (as test.as)

#include "axiom"

f():OutputForm =3D=3D {
   import from Integer;
   outputForm 1;
}

within Axiom, gives no error. But when calling the function f after  =

compilation, I get

>> System error:
    Unknown bfd format

. How can I get Axiom to run code that got compiled from within Axiom  =

using the Aldor compiler?




Let me now give you more details about the setup:

I know the downloaded file is a 32bit binary, but I have the appropriate=
  =

32bit libraries installed on my system:

Since you want to work with Axiom, I guess you are right here.

I currently rather rely on what is provided in LibAldor+LibAlgebra and 
don't take things from LibAxiom, but that is personal taste.

It seems that you want

---BEGIN sum.as
#include "axiom"
macro {
	MyAdditiveMonoid == with {
		0: %;
		+: (%, %) -> %;
	}
}
SumPackage(M: MyAdditiveMonoid): with {
     sum: Generator M -> M;
} == add {
      sum(g: Generator M): M == {
          m: M := 0;
          for x in g repeat m := m+x;
          return m;
      }
}
---END sum.as

You would call that via

l: List Integer := [2,3,4]
sum generator l

You have probably read that "Generator" abstracts from the actual 
underlying datastructure and only relies on the fact that the elements 
are delivered in a linear fashion. The bad thing is: "Generator" is not 
available in an Axiom Session. And even worse, no Axiom domain provides 
a "generator" function for its elements.
You always have to hide it inside an Aldor program. So your problem is 
probably not easily solvable. But that would be my Aldor approach.

I don't know of any "Bounded..." category in Axiom.

Yep. But sorry to say: Axiom is weak in that respect (at least to my 
knowledge).

I wasn't aware that this is possible.
Using  #include "aldor" and #include "algebra" compiles but won't run:
(1) -> sum [1,2,3]

how can one mix axiom and libaldor?

yes, this looked elegant and promising.

ok, at least this is an answer and I shall not try further.
Thus my "SumPackage" includes also

                 sum ( ll: Stream R) : R == {
                         import from StreamFunctions2(R,R);
                         last complete scan(0,+, ll);
                 }

Is it really true that StreamFunctions2 must explicitly be imported?

The "last complete scan" makes me worry if the stream is really long
and all intermediate results are stored; or is it optimized away by the 
compiler?

I rather would like the for loop but do not know where to import it from.
greping the source files is not really helpful in this case ...

Well, if you do simplification by hand, then my example give
the same result in Maple, Maxima and giac.  But AFAICS
Axiom situation is worse, because the simplification is
done automatically (apparently the other systems calculate in
a ring without zero divisors and only simplify the final answer,
which is sound).  Also, Axiom may automatically introduce
roots even if original input contained none.  Anyway, I think
that in 2007 we should do better.

I think that the core problem is that roots in computer algebra
are really ill-defined.  For well-defined non-nested roots already
in 1971 Fateman gave resonable solution.  General well-defined
roots can be resolved via factorization in algebraic extensions
(factorization is expensive, but seem to work reasonably well in
Axiom). 

More precisely, one possibility is that say sqrt(x+1) is just
a solution of the equation y^2 - x - 1 = 0.  Analytically,
then sqrt(x+1) is a multivalued analytic function with a
single finite branch point at x = -1 (and the second branch
point at infinity).  Algebraically, P(y) = y^2 - x - 1 is
an irreducible polymomial over Q(x) and we get a well defined
quadratic extension.  Large part of Axiom assumes such an
interpretation.

If we look at sqrt(2)*sqrt(3*x)-sqrt(6*x) we see that
P(y) = y^2 - 6*x splits over Q(x, sqrt(2), sqrt(3*x)).  To
have a field we should either (more or less arbitrarily)
choose one of roots (factors) or reject the input or split
computation into two branches (introduce provisos).

There is an extra difficulty: traditional numerical definitions
of elementary functions have branch cuts.  Branch cuts means
that we no longer have analytic functions and we may get
zero divisors even if algebraic approach would produce unique
answer.

Branch cuts turn decidable problem into undecidable one:

Claim1: Let A be an algebra of complex functions closed under +, -, *
and composition.
Assume that A contains rational constants, pi, x, sin, and sqrt (with
branch cut along negative half-axis).  Then the following questions are
undecidable:

1) is an element of A zero for all x?
2) is real part of an element of A always positive?

Proof: Let phi(t) = sqrt(sqrt(t^4)) and s(x)=sin(pi*x_1)*...*sin(pi*x_n).
Consider multivariate functions of the
form f = phi(P_1(x))+phi(P_2*s(x))+phi(s(x)) - 1. Like in Richardson
proof for any multivariate polynomial Q we can make an f which
has real part positive if and only if Q has no integral zero
(Richardson used more complicated Q, but thanks to Matiasevitch it
is enough to consider polymomial Q). Then we get the conclusion the
same way as Richardson.


Remark: We can use phi(t) - t to produce zero divisors in the algebra A
(that is why I omitted division from the signature).

----------

Claim2: Let K be a differential field with field of constants k.
Assume that K = k(u_1, ..., u_n) is given as a tower of extensions
such that each u_i satisfies one of the following:

1) P(u_i) = 0 where P is an irreducible polynomial over
   k(u_1,...,u_(i-1))
2) D u_i = (Df) u_i with f in k(u_1,...,u_(i-1))
3) D u_i = (Df)/f with f in k(u_1,...,u_(i-1))

in cases 2 and 3 we assume that u_i is transcendental over
k(u_1,...,u_(i-1)).  Assume also that k is effectively computable.
Then K is effectively computable and given an equation for u of the form
D u (Df) u or D u (Df)/f with f in K there is an algorithm which either
finds out an algebraic extension of K containinig u solving the
equation of proves that adding transcendental u satifying the equation
does not add new constants.  We can also decide if a given
polynomial is irreducible over K.

Proof:  The claim is just a restatement of Risch stucture theorem
plus known (and implemented in Axiom) algorithms for computation
in algebraic extensions.

-----

Claim2 means that computation with elementary functions in algebraic
setup may be done effectively as long as we do not get into trouble
due to constants (and if Schanuel conjecture is true also computation
with constants is effective).  In practice, regardless of Schanuel
conjecture we may use floating point computations to prove that
a constant is non-zero or to get an indication that with high
probability it is indeed zero.

Coming back to Axiom expressions: the theoretical basis for Expression
domain is a theorem that any finitly generated field K has form:

K = k(u_1, ..., u_m, u_{m+1},..., u_n)

where k is a prime field, u_1, ..., u_m are algebraicaly independent
(so k(u_1, ..., u_m) is just the field of rational functions) and
u_{m+1},..., u_n correspond to a tower of algebraic extensions. In
particular, we should know the minimal polynomial of u_l over
k(u_1, ..., u_{l-1}) for l = m+1, ..., n.  

So, one way to solve zero divisor Expression problem is to rewrite
all kernels in terms of a set of algbraically independent kernels
and a set of "independent" algebraics.  We can use Risch structure
theorem and factorization in algebraic extensions to find out
such independent sets as long as we limit ourselfs to elementary
functions.  Unfortunatly, the situation with special functions
in much less clear: AFAIK there is no known comprehensive structure
theorem but also no known obstacles to derive such a theorem.

If we limit ourselfs to functions defined by linerar ODEs we can
effectively solve zero equivalence problem.

So as alternative solution we can do divisions only if we can prove
that divisor is non-zero.  In most cases such proof could be done
by rather cheap floating point computation (but ATM Axiom have
very weak support for numeric computation of special functions).

I am not sure how well we want to support branch cuts.  I belive
that in most practical cases functions are analytic, for example
sqrt(exp(%i*x)) is just exp(%i*x/2) (while branch cut interpretation
would produce artifical discontinuities).  In other work "correctly"
handling branch cuts means solving hard problem giving result
which probably does not match with user expectations...

OTOH for numeric computation branch cuts seem to be accepted
solution.  Using one definition for symbolic computations
and a different one for numeric computations breaks one
of fundamental expectations (namely, that evaluating functions
at a point is a homomorphizm).

My guess is that the version of gcl from which Axiom+Aldor was
produced does not specify the appropriate gcc option (-m32 ?) to
ensure that the object file that is created from the Aldor lisp
output can be linked with the Axiom+Aldor binary.

I run Axiom with Aldor on my AMD64 system but I have compiled
both Axiom and Aldor from source on this system. If you absolutely
need a binary install, then I could create a tarball from this
system. Otherwise, I would recommend compiling Axiom from current
sources (I like the SourceForge svn build-improvements branch plus
the bug fixes from wh-sandbox branch.). You can then download the
amd64-bit version of Aldor from the link at the bottom of page:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/Aldor

Then you must follow the procedure at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AldorForAxiom

to link Axiom with Aldor.

Probably when the lisp generated by Aldor inside Axiom+Aldor is
compiled to object code, the object code defaults to a 64-bit
format that is incompatible with Axiom compiled for a 32-bit
system. It might be possible to get around this by specifying
different options for the compile. But I think you would be
happier running both Axiom and Aldor in full 64-bit mode.

Right. There are not so many people anyway. And your question is not

I don't mix. You misunderstood. I for my taste find the libraries coming 
with Aldor cleaner. And even though they have much less functionality, 
it is sufficient for me. Sooner or later the Axiom library has to be 
redesigned anyway, because the files should become literate documents 
and all mis-design should go away. But that is a lot of work and 
certainly not finished tomorrow.

Anyway, you have to use

#include "axiom"

if you want to use your things inside an Axiom session (which is not 
primarily my goal).

Well, somebody should make Generator available in Axiom. ;-)
Actually, making Generator available is easy, but still that is not 
enough. Axiom does not allow a Generator in a for expression so

g: Generator X := someAldorFunctionThatReturnsAGenerator()
for x in g repeat doSomething(x)

won't work. One can even work around a little as has been demonstrated 
by Martin Rubey...

http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=37824208

Look into

svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat/trunk
directory combinat/src/axiom-compatibility/axcompat*.as.nw

in order to see how Generator is made available.

In fact Aldor-Combinat is developed on libaldor+libalgebra, but by this 
files in "axiom-compatibility" we provide some wrapper function to make 
(nearly) the same code also compiling with libaxiom and thus available 
in Axiom.

StreamFunctions2 is a package. How else would the compiler find out that 
you want to use a function from that package?

I don't think the compiler can optimize that away.
But in StreamAggregate you also find the exports

   frst: % -> S
     ++ frst(s) returns the first element of stream s.
     ++ Caution: this function should only be called after a 
\spad{empty?} test
     ++ has been made since there no error check.
   rst: % -> %
     ++ rst(s) returns a pointer to the next node of stream s.
     ++ Caution: this function should only be called after a 
\spad{empty?} test
     ++ has been made since there no error check.

There is also first and rest, but don't ask me which one you should use, 
I have no idea.

> I rather would like the for loop but do not know where to import it from.

Use a while loop a la...

s: R := 0;
while not empty? ll repeat {
   s := s + first ll;
   ll := rest ll;
}

Hope that helps

I have checked the impact of commplex argument patch on mapleok.
AFAICS the patch fixed 11 results. In one case previously correct
result changed to a wrong one. A few cases the results changed, but
both old and new result is wrong. 

In general, we get a lot of wrong results in mapleok.  The main reasons
are:
- our indefinite integrals have spurious singularities (the argument
  patch eliminated some of them)
- we miss divergence of the integral (no wonder, since most integrals
  use "noPole" option)
- we miss imaginary part.  Many integrands have arguments outside
  "real" domain and (at least in branch cut interpretation) have
  complex values (sometimes arguments are on branch cuts).  ATM
  Axiom discards (if present) imaginary part of the result.

Also, the results look too complicated (at least in some cases I know
that there is simpler answer).

Hello,

I wanted to make Axiom available for all users of a Linux computer.
So I gave read and cd permission to every directory and read permission 
to every file. Furthermore I made the files under axiom/mnt/linux/bin 
executable for all.

However, as I learned now, that's not enough. There are executable files 
under axiom/mnt/linux/lib.

Should I have expected that?

I find very important this last point of view.

I try to use and to teach almost(?) the same mathematics with a pencil
and with a computer algebra system to my students.

A lot of formula about sqrt are right because there are the usual
branch cuts. Without theses branch cuts I fear we can write=20
-1 =3D 1^(1/2) =3D 1 and the equal isn't so associative.

I think the map notion has priority over branch cut.
For real numbers sqrt (x^2) =3D abs x is an universal equality=20
because sqrt is a map.=20

When we prefer to write sqrt (x^2) =3D x we loose the common sens of=20
mathematics and all the map abilities.

I give this exercice to my students.=20
Solve in x for a real number a the equation a (a-1) x =3D a
(or an other equation as this one)
With an algebra point of view we get x =3D 1/(a-1).

Standard mathematics prefers : a=3D0 =3D> every x is solution.
                               a=3D1 =3D> there is no solution
                                   =3D> x =3D 1 / (a-1)

0/0 is undefined, even in a/a when a=3D0

I prefer a CAS which respect (almost) all mathematics by default.

When the question is undecidable or isn't coded an option=20
as << NoPole >> prevents the user to be prudent.=20
The topic of the #285 bug is almost the same.

In the elemntry package I test I only simplify by default exp (log z) =3D=
 z,=20
not log (exp z) =3D z.=20

But in a rewrite? package I'll add a rewrite rule as
rewrite (log (exp z), logExp) which gives z.

The following may be contraversial but their experience may
be relevant to Axiom Foundation. Perhaps we can avoid what
Jaspert predicted, and please do not start any discussions
:-).

(This is "old" news, so may be it has been posted already,
or the situation has changed.)

Disgruntled Debian Developers Delay Etch

Debian GNU/Linux 4.0, code-named Etch, had been due to
arrive by Dec. 4, 2006, but it's been delayed because some
developers have deliberately slowed down their work.

Of course I wouldn't want to waste time discussing this :-) but
it might be relevant to note that the Axiom Foundation has not
yet paid anyone anything for working on Axiom. The only announced
initiative is to pay small "bounties" to encourage/reward Axiom
developers.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomFoundation

At the present time it has assets of about $500, entirely due to
donations, which seem to arrive at the rate of about $50 every
6 months or so ... So it seems that we can only "wish" that we
had the problems the Debian has. :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Below is a package for producing presentation MathML.  It's my first attempt
and based on Robert Sutor's TeXFomat domain.  It's not finished but I would
particularly appreciate if somebody else would be interested in testing 
it and
letting me know what doesn't work.

For now I have three exposed functions: coerce, coerceS and coerceL.

So after compiling and then entering some Axiom command, say x**2,
type

coerce(%)
this produces the MathML string as Axiom formats things for output

coerceS(%)
this also outputs with an initial attempt at formatting based on the
structure of the MathML, so take this and paste it into a suitable xml
file and open it in Firefox.  If you paste this into emacs in nxml-mode
and indent-according-to-mode then it is supposed to be more
agreeable for human perusal.

coerceL(%)
this outputs the MathML string as one long line, more suitable for dom
insertion behind the scenes by javascript

I do intend, before I'm finished, to put this into the requisite pamphlet
style with more detailed documentation.  I also have plans to start soon
on a content MathML package.

Maybe that is a blessing in disguise. I think the donations have been
dribbling in because people do not see how the awards can be helpful.
When the award is too small, it is not a meaningful recognition
(compared with the actual appreciation from users). When it is large
enough, there will be the Debian dilemma.

Managing small grants is never worth the trouble and their rewards
lie mainly as entries in resumes. If we can raise a substantial
amount (at least $100k), we can at least support some graduate
students. But from your report, that seems hopeless, and fund-raising
is also a very time-consuming endeavor.

oh, besides the aldor compiler, axiom also uses gcl to compile aldor  
sources?
How can I pass options to the gcl call? (When stating “)co something” only  
the Aldor options are shown, so I supposed calling Aldor would be the  
whole story)

I tried to follow that guide, but ran into trouble already at step 5  
“Update your axiom source code to patch 44”, as for a fresh install, of  
course I could not “tla update”. I tried with the silver sources instead.  
Building axiom aborted, and make complained about denied permission to  
modify
/home/tmgisi/axiom64/axiom.silver/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/tex/.svn/entries
/home/tmgisi/axiom64/axiom.silver/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/tex/.svn/all-wcprops
/home/tmgisi/axiom64/axiom.silver/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/tex/.svn/prop-base/axiom.sty.svn-base
/home/tmgisi/axiom64/axiom.silver/axiom/mnt/linux/bin/tex/.svn/text-base/axiom.sty.svn-base

chmodding everything within /hemo/tmgisi/axiom64 to 777, make got past  
this point but make did not proceed for more than 24-hours at:

make[3]: Entering directory  
`/home/tmgisi/axiom64/axiom.silver/axiom/src/doc'
1 making /home/tmgisi/axiom64/axiom.silver/axiom/int/doc/axiom.bib from

So obviously, at step 5 of
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AldorForAxiom
I chose the wrong sources. Would the golden one be the correct one then?

Kind regards,
Christian

Aldor is only called to produce .ao, .asy, and .lsp files. Axiom starts=20
gcl in a second pass to make an .o file out of .lsp.

That is a bug that I fixed in revision 75 of branches/build-improvements =

at sourceforge.

Makefile.pamphlet:
   Removed the line
	@cp -pr ${SRC}/scripts/* ${MNT}/${SYS}/bin
   from the target "rootdirs".

scr/scripts/Makefile.pamphlet:
   Replace the "all" target code by the following two targets.

all: ${OUT}/Makefile.pamphlet
	-@mkdir -p ${OUT}/tex

${OUT}/Makefile.pamphlet:
	@echo 1 making ${SRC}/scripts
	cp -pr * ${OUT}

There is actually another change in src/doc/Makefile.pamphlet, but maybe =

the two files above suffice.

Maybe it is easier to use svk instead of svn. svk does not put .svn=20
directories inside the checked out tree.

?

At least I compiled axiom--main--1--patch-50 (which is the current Gold=20
version) exactly as described on
http://axiom.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/mathaction/AxiomSilverBranch (including =

the compilation of libaxiom.al.

I haven't yet tried Silver.

Good luck
Ralf

Just press the Enter key twice or more. (That was latex wanting
interaction with you because of faulty formatting commands).

That is a known issue that was fixed a while ago -- at least in the
build-improvements branch; I thought it was also fixed in the mainline.

Can you resend your package in an attachment please, my MUA reformats
long lines (same thing, apparently, in the mailing list archives).

I should probably clarify what I wrote.  I want Axiom to produce
mathematically correct results.  Since many algorithms used by
Axiom are valid only in algebraic setting corresponding packages
should use algebraic interpretation (otherwise we get wrong
results).  To handle conventions used in calculus we need higher
level packages.  Such packages may for example find out that
x is always positive, so abs(x) = x, or if x changes sign such
package must split computation into two cases, one when abs(x) = x
and the another one where abs(x) = -x, and then finally recombine
the results.  

But the case analysis may get messy (after all the problem is
undecidable) and will have to give up (say return expression 
unevaluated).  My feeling is that when analysing branch cuts
we may give up pretty quickly without loosing much of the
usefull expressions.  OTOH it may be usefull to provide special
versions of log (and friends) which do not have branch cuts
-- such versions are more usefull for complex analysis.

No, algebraic approach requires irreducible polynomial. 
x^2-1 = (x + 1)*(x - 1) is reducible.  So at low level 1^(1/2) is
illegal.  At higher level 1^(1/2) should be either rejected or
(better) rewriten as 1.

Yes, but once we allow abs we have zero divisors -- so no function
field can allow abs.  Insted the higher level code must split the
expression into two branches (or delegate the work to a ring)
And I certainly do not want Axiom to belive that 
sqrt((x+%i*y)^2) = abs (x+%i*y)

IIRC some complex analysis texbooks contain formulas with sqrt which
are invalid if sqrt has branch cuts.

You have a point here (Axiom currently gives the first answer).

This is impossible if you want to stay in a single domain.
For example, I freqently use the formula:

exp(x)-exp(y) = integrate(exp((1-s)*x)*(y-x)*exp(s*y), s=0..1)

valid when x and y are (no commuting) operators.  This formula
would be ruined by usual simplifications of exponentials.

Working with differential field we want log(exp(x)) = x.

So really each Axiom domain must implement its on simplifications.

You are doing nice things with expressions.  But have you thought
how your work fits into Axiom design?  Note that if your domain contain
division and you fail to discover zero the you are likely to get wrong
results.  So the approach "simplify only when valid" may work only if
you do not simplify fractions.  And Axiom simplifies fractions when
working with expressions...

thank you. I did not dare just to step over such issues, ...
However, just ignoring the problem *sigh* allowed me to compile Axiom.
Thank you.

Kind regards,

Both Gaby and I have successfully built Axiom on Windows from a
recent version of gcl-2.6.8pre. What is required in order to test
this "windows-only read patch"?

Camm,

What are the symptoms of this change? What problem is it
intended to correct? How can I test it? Is it sufficient
if I can build Axiom on windows after this change?

Regards,
Bill Page.

The code is intended to fix read-char-no-hang, which had been broken
for a long time.  This caused Mike Thomas some problem of which I do
not know the details, hence his ifdef patch with the comment:

revision 1.14.4.1.2.2.2.4.6.1.6.1.4.3
date: 2006-06-15 22:26:22 -0400;  author: mjthomas;  state: Exp;  lines: +2 -1
Band aid fix to stop build failure on Windows.
----------------------------

Vadim found the discrepancy in testing maxima:

http://www.mail-archive.com/gcl-devel@gnu.org/msg01408.html

Ideally, I'd like to know that reverting the patch works for both of
you.  I'd really be pleased if someone could try acl2 as well.

Alas, due to email chaos, I seem to be disconnected from Vadim.

Take care,

Sorry, probably I've lost track of the topic.
I'm ready to test with Maxima on both Linux and Windows.
Would you please clarify which version of GCL should
be tested.  GCL 2.6.8 CVS without aforementioned patch?

I have looked at bug 101.  At the end of LaplaceTransform.locallaplace
we have:

      -- last chance option: try to use the fact that
      --    laplace(f(t),t,s) = s laplace(g(t),t,s) - g(0)  where dg/dt = f(t)
      elem?(int := lfintegrate(f, t)) and (rint := retractIfCan int) case F =>
           fint := rint :: F
           -- to avoid infinite loops, we don't call laplace recursively
           -- if the integral has no new logs and f is an algebraic function
           empty?(logpart int) and algebraic?(f, t) => oplap(fint, tt, ss)
           ss * locallaplace(fint, t, tt, s, ss) - eval(fint, tt = 0)


The recursion here is responsible for infinite loop when computing
laplace(log(z), z, w).  Namely, at this point f = log(z).  Integrating
we get  z*log(z) - z.  First part of locallaplace uses linearity
and recurses with f = z*log(z).  Again first part factors out z and
recurses with f = log(z)...

ATM I am unable to find a function such that this fragment helps.  OTOH
the fragment is quite likely to cause infinite recursion so I consider
disabling it.

Hi,

  There is a duplicate test for the data type used to implement
the abstract syntax trees found in src/interp/ptrees.boot.
This is a correction I would have liked to apply globally to 
Axiom trunk, but the trunk has gone through several renamings,
mutations, redefinitions, changes of status, etc. so that I don't know
what is what at this moment.  So, I'm committing to the
build-improvement branch only.

I've been reviewing your documents on Fortress.

Have you seen Axiom (http://wiki.axiom-developer.org)?
It already has some of the parameterized types as well as
a very strong mathematical structure.

One thought about parallelism is that you've implicitly
introduced a serial idea when you do computation by
a series of assignments. This seriously inhibits your
ability to think and program in parallel. Instead of
the serial assignment model of programming you might
consider thinking in terms of conditions on the initial and
final states of a computation.

Within a mathematical based language (e.g. Axiom)
it would be more natural and reasonable to introduce
parallelism by using PROVISOS..

A proviso is a set of conditions attached to a particular
equation. For instance, you often see in mathematical
textbooks statements of the form:

    1/x provided x <> 0

A study I did shows that about 80% of all of the provisos
attached to mathematical statements in books can be written in
interval form. The above could be expressed as a statement
with two interval conditions

  1/x provided ([-\infty < x < 0] or [0 > x > \infty])

These provisos are naturally added by operators (e.g. division)

Now this statement naturally breaks into two disjoint parts.
If you assume that this statement arises in the middle of a
mathematical computation you have a natural branch point
for parallel computations, the "left branch" computing under
the proviso

  1/x provided [-\infty < x < 0]

and the "right branch" computing under the proviso

  1/x provided [0 > x > \infty]

assuming further that another division occurs, perchance by y
we might find the left branch computation continued as

  (1/x provided [-\infty < x < 0])/y provided
       ([-\infty < y < 0] or [0 > y > \infty])

which naturally branches again giving 4 disjoint paths for
the computation. Thus mathematical computation
under provisos creates natural parallel tree structures.

Combining branches on the tree involves two kinds of  computation...
computing "with" provisos and computing "of" provisos.

Computing "with" provisos creates the branching structure above.
Computing "of" provisos involves combination within the provisos
portion so that we might find combinations like:

    ((foo(x) provided [3 < x < 4]) provided [3 < x < 4])

which trivially collapses into

    (foo(x) provided [3 < x < 4])

While not interesting mathematically we have just managed to
combine two branches of the tree into a single branch, thus
creating a "join" condition using provisos. Computation "of"
provisos also introduces a natural place to generate program
proofs. The language of the proviso can be very logic based
yielding the ability to use ACL2 (Univ. of Texas work).



The whole idea is too large to fit into this margin but you can
see infer some interesting features.

* parallel computations arise naturally.
* branch cuts, poles, properties (e.g. entire, meromorphic) can be 
expressed as provisos.
* computations carry assumptions and ranges of validity
* multi-valued answers (e.g. piecewise equations) are natural
* computational ranges are easily expressed (e.g. [minint <= x <= maxint])


I'm concerned that you're creating your own box by deciding to
follow the standard model of serial programming. Under the
assumption that this language is used for mathematics the proviso
model is much more natural and powerful.

Lisp tells me that ncloopProcess is undefined:

)lisp (fboundp '|ncloopProcess|)

Value = NIL

Grepping shows that ncloopProcess is only used in ncloopInclude0
which in turn is only used in ncloopInclude which is unused.

AFAICS this is part of "new" unfinished toplevel.

Thanks for concurring.

I speculated, based on the missing definition, that ncloopInclude may
be not be used at the moment.

OK, thanks.  

We should probably have a list "open projects" consisting of
unfinished "new" parts.

Tim --

  The function sayMessage appears to be defined at least in two locations:

   (1) src/interp/mark.boot
   (2) src/interp/msgdb.boot

which one should be considered the "true" definition?


[ also, the perspective is having many definitions, overriding or not,
 for same functions is seriously annoying when looking for
 information. ]

mark.boot is part of Axiom to Aldor translator.  In normal use this
file (as all TRANOBJS) is not used.  Before starting Axiom to Aldor
translatotion TRANOBJS are loaded and overwrite many compiler functions.
I personally do not like this design, but it is not clear if
alternatives are better.  I considered:

- making a completly independent function hierarchy for translator
- adding global flag tested by relevant compiler functions
- using assignment to 'symbol-function'
- mixture of all above

First variant means significant code duplication. Second variant
means that individal compiler functions would be cluttered with extra
functionality which is unused during normal operation.  Third
variant is a slight improvement compared to current situation
(would allow to restore normal operation when the translator
has finished), but ATM I am not sure if gains would justify
effort.  Fourth variant IMHO would only add confusion due to
inconsistency.

As far as I know, the nc functions are from the "New Compiler",
which does not exist anymore. It should have replaced the old compiler,
which is the current SPAD compiler. This does not mean, that the
functions might be used somewhere :-(.

Hi Juergen,

  You said "which does not exist anymore".  Did you mean it existed at
some point, but was removed?  If yes, do you happen to remember what
the reasons were?

Thanks!

Hi,

I think, before 1990 someone wrote a new scratchpad compiler in
lisp. It seems that it was not better than the old one. So
the code was abandoned and the A#/Aldor compiler was developed
around 1990. Maybe Tim knows more details.=20

Thanks for your comments about Fortress and Axiom.
I have seen older documents about Axiom, and you
have given me some new ideas to think about.

The problem here is that sin asin(7.0::COMPLEX FLOAT) give something
close to -7.  This is due to wrong bunch cuts during evaliation.
Namely in trigcat we have:

asin x == atan(x/sqrt(1-x**2))

this formula for asin has wrong branch cuts. When x is real and bigger
then 1 sqrt(1-x**2) is imaginary with positive imaginary part. So
x/sqrt(1-x**2) is imaginary with _negative_ imaginary part. atan has
branch cut on %i*[-1, %minusInfinity], with jump discontinuity when
real part goes to 0 trough positve values. This discontinuity means
that values of asin are wrong (of opposite sign) for big real x.

There is an easy workaround, put:

asin x == -atan(-x/sqrt(1-x**2))

However, the problem with asin is just one special case.  We
would like to support many multivalued special functions (which in
numerical version require branch cuts).  Tracking that we get
"correct" values on cuts may well take significant portion of
effert to implements those functions.  OTOH computing with
values on branch cuts does not seem very useful.  So I am tempted
to declare that arguments branch cuts are errors (like divison
by 0).

I'm concerned with that approach.

After all, this is a mathematical computational platform.  If we go
that way, how else can we expect other people to take branch cuts
seriously?

After further examination I have found that this does not work
(appearantly I was using different version for machine test, and
analysis shows that the formula above is wrong).  Actually,
now I am convinced that there is no simple "real" formula giving
correct branch cuts.  Official Lisp formula for asin is

asin x == -%i*log(%i*x+sqrt(1-x^2))

The Lisp formula stays away from branch cuts of logarithm, and only
branch cut of sqrt matters (and defines brunch cuts of asin).

So, to get correct asin we need a real function which contains
-%i*log as the last step of computation.  However, our only
primitive of this sort is atan and contains spurious branch cut.

So we probably need to provide a complex asin in Complex (or throw
error for computations on branch cuts).  We could also try to use
complex formula in TrigonometricFunctionCategory, but I am affraid
that Axiom assumes in too many places that real functions of
real arguments are computed in "real way", we could easily get
wrong results (starting from enexpected complex expressions to
plain wrong).

Tim --

  The interpreter (in particular pf2Sex) does not handle category
definitions (with-expression).  Is that by design or an "unfinished" part?

In case it is by design, what is the rationale?

Scratchpad was a research project used by many people in 
different ways. As such it was always a "work in progress".

Several people worked on "the new compiler" over time.
The original plan was to have the new compiler exist in
the lisp system. Stephen Watt decided to implement it in C
as a standalone program and this became the final version.
However there were many "new compilers" in lisp both before
and during that effort. The early compilers tried new ideas
and the later compilers maintained compatibility with aldor.

The "new compiler" (remember that the word "new" basically
meant "this week's changes") was carried on in parallel in
both C (asharp,aldor) and lisp. We had to keep the syntax
and semantics as close as possible. The "old compiler" and 
the "new compiler" existed at the same time in the lisp
system. (Note that "the old compiler" refers to last week's
version and "the new compiler" was this week's version).

This was also true with the "old boot parser" and "the new
boot parser" and the interpreter, etc. Everything was always
changing. 

IBM hit a rough financial patch and Scratchpad was turned
into a "product" and sold to NAG. The process was not very
clean as we had very little time. Plus we had other tasks
such as adding the fortran interface so we could talk to
the NAG library, additional code changes to handle Arthur
Norman's CCL and a huge documentation effort.

Thus the code you see has never had a "proper" cleanup.
We need to select and collect the live code, understand it,
document it, and restructure it so it can be maintained.
Thus it is hardly a surprise to find duplicate functions
with different definitions. Careful study is needed to
decide which one is used at what time (since some can be
autoloaded, overriding the existing definition).

Rather than taking each function individually I've been
walking the spanning code tree and dragging the functions
into bookvol5.pamphlet which is intended to be the new
interpreter. Someone needs to do something similar with
the compiler. This "garbage collection" approach will 
prove that any extra functions must be unused and can be
discarded.

Also of note with regard to ncloopProcess.... There are
several "top level"s of the Axiom system which are not
apparent. There are functions which start the boot parser,
compiler, or interpreter in different modes to do different
things. This is not documented and not apparent. It was
intended for use by the developers of axiom so they could
debug their programs. Some of these ended up abandoned.

I'm not sure that it is possible to create categories at the
interpreter level. Well, in theory it is since a category is
simply a lisp expression, but in practice I don't think it works.
Categories are a compile-time concept.

I'm unsure about the meaning you give to "compile-time" here.

Types are compile-time concepts too.  Yet, the interpreter has no
problem handing

   Foo == Record(f: Integer, b: Boolean)

or

   Bar := Record(f: Integer, b: Boolean)


Furthermore within an axiom session, it is possible to )compile a file
and have the result available in the working frame.

I tripped over this while working on new packages for Axiom, and
it really is confusing.  I would like to know whether there are
deep reasons for this, or whether it is because it was not
finished.

1)
What can be more serious than signaling error?

2) 
I am mathematician and I do not "take branch cuts seriously".
Serious math works with arbitrary branches, multivalued functions
or Riemennian surfaces.  Branch cuts are an artifical convention
which pretends that multivalued functions can be used naively in
numerical computations.  In some sense it is an ideal field for
standarisation: many choices are arbitrary, but for effective
shortcut communication everybody should use the same choices.
However, standarizing branch cuts produces a formal structure
which has little to do with original functions.  Once such structure
is available there is good chance that somebody will abuse it to
archive some good effect.  But in most cases it would be better to
use another mechanizm.  More specifically, serious complex numerical
computation can not depend on values on branch cuts -- simply
because of rounding error you never know whether you are exactly
on branch cut (you can only guarantee that you stay _away_ from
branch cut).  So, only relatively trivial formulas (where you
can fully anayze roundoff) can use values on branch cuts.  But
even then, it may well turn out (as is in our case) that the
values in not the needed one.

In Axiom getting a "new" instance of an existing type is easy,
you just call the constructor.  But to create a new type you
have to provide the constructor function.  Effectively you have
to "compile" the type.  In principle interpreter could transparently
pass the definition to the compiler, but IMHO differences in
interpreter and compiler language would destroy the illusion.

I'm a computational mathematician -- even though I ended up corrupted by
computer scientists -- and I do take branch cuts seriously.

[ In my PhD thesis work on Constant Mean Curvature surfaces, where
  I did lot of numerical simulation and "construction", Riemann
  surfaces were my benchwork. ]

But, they do.  And that is a matter of life Axiom has to take into
account if it ever has to be serious about "computational platform"

Somewhere we should record relevant literature on Axiom website.

I don't see where the problem is in TrigonometricFunctionCategory
What is the problem if the axiom file trigcat.spad contains :

if R is a complex numeric ring then
  asin can contains tests for ejecting problems in the atan special cases.
  [or uses the log formula, if there is a log]

if R is a real numeric ring then
  asin test the interval [-1, 1]

if R has log:R->R and imaginary:R->R then 
  asin x == -%i*log(%i*x+sqrt(1-x^2))   
-- is the most serious method because it's the most known formula.

else ... I have no idea ...

It's almost necessary to have complex inside formal expression
because a sqrt(-1) can very quickly appear : 
sqrt is an usual function and -1 is an usual number.

   Must this feature remains 
or is it a good idea to retains axiom to claim that 
Re(x+%i*y)=x and Im(x+%i*y)=y in usual cases.

Of corse theses equalities are right for algebraic computation, 
but I (we?) also use axiom for analysis calculus...

I'll hope I can show/use axiom to/with my students 
but in theses case I need calculus packages that are near 
from maple/mupad/ti89 and so.

We might also think that axiom will use (some years later) 
intervals for computation, it's useful for understand well posed formula : 
test the 3 sequences.
u(n+1)=(8*u(n)-1) 
with u(0) = 1/7 
  or u(0) = 1/7.0 
  or u(0) = the numerical interval [1/7-numerical error, 1/7+numerical error]

An other exercice I give sometimes to my students :
solve the formal z^4+2*m*z^2+1 polynomial in z, 
and plot the curve solution into Complex plan for m in R.

Neither early maple nor early mupad do it with a finest way.
I don't know what axiom can do in this case.

Today my students noticed that I write log and not ln on the blackboard.
You understand why !
French stuents dislike, but what is the international function name.

I am affraid that we miscomunicate: I was trying to reconstruct the
reasons why Axiom do not handle creating categories in the interpreter.
I do not defend the status quo.

Concerning differences, a little one which probably has no useful
justification: compiler accepts "until" keyword, but this keyword is
absent in the interpreter.

Dear all,

This sounds as if the interpreter would allow the definition of new
domains. However, from my experience, this is not the case.

I believe that both

>    Foo == Record(f: Integer, b: Boolean)
> 
> or
>

do not "really" define new domains. Foo is a macro that expands to
Record(f...), while Bar is a variable that is assigned Record(f...). However,
Record(f...) is an already defined domain, in fact, a very special one since it
is built in to the spad language (same holds for aldor, as far as I know).

For example, I get

(1) -> F: CoercibleTo OutputForm == add (Rep := Integer; coerce x == 1::OutputForm)
   Internal Error
   Unexpected error in call to system function pf2Sex1 

Martin

> In case it is by design, what is the rationale?

Looking at the aldor interpreter (where both is possible), it seems that it is
quite difficult. It is the bit where I experienced most segfaults...

I know.  That error is precisely why I asked the question.

What is the difference between putting that definition in a file
and subsequently issueing )co -- which will compile everything and
make it available in the working space -- as opposed to allowing
the definition  at the interpreter level and process (almost) exactly
the same way?

I believe the interpreter uses the "new parser" (src/interp/cparse.boot)
where "until" seems indeed missing.   I don't know whether that is
by design or a bug.  Note that that "new parser" is also intended
to be used by the "new compiler".

The interpreter does not have the treewalking machinery to dynamically
construct and use a category. The compiler does.

  (1)  But, they are not really two separate software.

  (2) the interpreter does what a category looks like syntactically.
      So, instead of aborting with an obscure message, it can just
      as well call the compiler sub-component with the parse tree

Dear Waldek,

Thanks a lot for your previous accurate reponse.

It seems you understand what I'm looking for, 
and  I hope understand how you want axiom computes. 

> I want Axiom to produce mathematically correct results.  
> [and use] algebraic interpretation otherwise we get wrong results.

> To handle conventions used in calculus we need higher
> level packages.

> But the case analysis may get messy (after all the problem is

> unevaluated).

For students I must have a minimal analysis point of view.

It's right, axiom can have both points of view with (many) domains.
    1/ algebraic domains which are really right 
and 2/ others domains for usual calculus, less perfect but more usual...

> This is impossible if you want to stay in a single domain.
> [I cut the two pretty examples with exp and log]
> So really each Axiom domain must implement its on simplifications.

I agree, I recognize I forget this notion when I began to study elemntry.spad.

> Have you thought how your work fits into Axiom design? 
First I thought it was the aim of Expression.
But now I recognize it's perhaps a bad idea.

Hi Everybody ! 
Do you have any idea about calculus domain for easy computation 
as Maple, mupad and other Texas pocket calculators ?

Do you have an .axiom.input for students and professors ?

By example my students don't know the minimal polynomial for algebraic number,
so the reponse true for this calculus is too curious : 

[axiom] a := 3 + sqrt 5 ; test ((a^2)^(1/2)=-a)   --- the reponse is true

So for theses computations I pefer to use RealClosure than AlgebraicNumber ;
and I expect to have a smaller axiom, but a consistent system.

Please, give me some advices !

Francois

Dear Gabriel,

If you are looking in the interpreter is it possible to improve axion 
about anonymous functions :

[t+k for k in 1..12]         -- is right in axiom
[(t+->t+k) for k in 1..12]   -- I can't get 12 functions with 12 integers.

[t +-> t+1, t +-> t+2]          -- is well declared, but I can't sign it
map (f +-> f(55), [t +-> t+1, t +-> t+2])-- doesn't work, I must sign it

Do you have any information about the anonymous functions.

Francois (again)

I have not come to that point yet.
So far, I only have documentation for

  * lexing
  * parsing (new compiler)
  * parts of the interpreter (parsing excluded)
  * lisplib generation

But, I'll definitely look into the anonymous functions.  Thanks for
providing the test case.

Hello Waldek,

In this previous mail you write :

> This is impossible if you want to stay in a single domain.
> For example, I freqently use the formula:
> 
> exp(x)-exp(y) = integrate(exp((1-s)*x)*(y-x)*exp(s*y), s=0..1)

Do you use the domain Expression for this ? 
It seems that domain Expression is commutative for * ?

If so for a student/naive/general/teaching use it's only necessary to 
load the naivePackage for the same domain expression.

If we want algebraic rule as you describe an other package over the same
domain will be better.

> So really each Axiom domain must implement its on simplifications.

In this case I'm not sure.

> You are doing nice things with expressions.  But have you thought

The Question remains.

Hello again,

thank you for all your help you gave last time.
I am still new to axiom/aldor and perhaps somebody can point out
to me the difference between the following two snippets:

---BEGIN strange.as
#include "axiom"

FPI ==> Fraction Polynomial Integer;

tfpi1(d:Polynomial Integer,n:PositiveInteger): Fraction Polynomial Integer 
== {
      import from Integer;
      (1/factorial(n::Integer)^2)::FPI*d;
}

tfpi2(d:Polynomial Integer,n:PositiveInteger): Fraction Polynomial Integer 
== {
      import from Integer;
      (1/factorial(n::Integer)::FPI)^2::PositiveInteger*d;
}
---END strange.as
both functions compile fine with aldor and apparently should give the same 
result, however axiom (version 20060621 on Debian) does not think this 
way:

---BEGIN axiom
(4) -> tfpi1(x,3)
Looking in Polynomial(Integer()) for ??200088  with code 250738832

     >> System error:
     FOAM-USER::|fiRaiseException| is invalid as a function.

(4) -> tfpi2(x,3)
(4) ->
           x
     (4)  --
          36
                                              Type: Fraction Polynomial 
Integer
---END axiom

what am I missing here?

thanks,
Franz

Dear Franz,

I can only guess...

3B
* 1 is interpreted as an Integer (because of import from Integer)

* factorial is interpreted as factorial: % -> % from Integer (again because of
  the import from Integer)

* ^ ditto

this looks like axiom couldn't find some function. It would be nice to know
which one, of course...

I think the following should work:

tfpi1(d:Polynomial Integer,n:PositiveInteger): Fraction Polynomial Integer == {
      import from Integer, Fraction Integer;
      (1/factorial(n::Integer)^2)::FPI*d;
}

or

tfpi1(d:Polynomial Integer,n:PositiveInteger): Fraction Polynomial Integer == {
      import from Integer;
      d/(factorial(n::Integer)^2)::(Polynomial Integer);
}

Martin

Hello,

I also played a bit with your code, but I cannot quite give the same 
reasoning as Martin.

The compiler actually has 3 choices
   Polynomial Integer
   Positive Integer
   Fraction Polynomial Integer
since they appear in the input and output types of tfpi1. For the input 
types I am pretty sure that Aldor automatically imports them. I am not 
so sure with the output type, but that could be tested easily. 
Unfortunately, I cannot point to the right place in the Aldor User 
Guide, but (maybe) one cannot even clearly find it -- I simply don't 
know by heart.
And there is a fourth choice coming from "import from Integer".

It is a bit hard now to look for a function /.

Me too. Interestingly the compiler says

woodpecker:~/scratch>aldor -mno-mactext -mno-abbrev strange.as
"strange.as", line 9:       (1/factorial(n::Integer)^2)::FPI*d;
                       ...................................^
[L9 C36] #1 (Error) (After Macro Expansion) There are 2 meanings for the 
operator `coerce'.
	Meaning 1: Fraction(Integer) -> Fraction(Polynomial(Integer))
	Meaning 2: Polynomial(Integer) -> Fraction(Polynomial(Integer))
Expanded expression was: Fraction(Polynomial(Integer))

If one additionally says "import from Fraction Integer;". That seems 
like the coerce function is causing trouble.

Note that a::T should be equivalent to coerce(a)@T. But it does not tell 
from which domain/package the coerce should come. I faintly remember 
that I have resolved segfaults just by writing coerce(a) instead of a::T.

Unfortunately, the compiler is not saying where it finds meaning 1 and 
2. So I cannot say what goes wrong. But what I dont understand is: why 
is the second meaning an option for the compiler. How can it deduce the 
type of 1/something to be Polynomial(Integer)???

What about

tfpi1(d:Polynomial Integer,n:PositiveInteger): Fraction Polynomial 
Integer == {
      import from Integer;
      f: Z := factorial(n::Z);
      q: Q := 1/f^2;
      (q::FPI) * (d :: FPI);
}

It is never bad to add a bit of redundancy (namely the types). It's 
easier for humans and it helps the compiler.

Ralf

The platform is Ubuntu Edgy Eft 6.10. I attempted to build a fresh checkout

Appears to be solved by installing dev-versions of gmp, gcl, X11, readline,

Hello,

It is possible in Axiom to modify its behavior when an error is
encountered via

)set break something

But if you set it to 'query', Axiom will ask you if you want to return
to top level or enter a Lisp break loop. What I find strange is that
this not what Axiom has to do. The code is (g-error.boot):

=======================================================================

msgQ := 
 $cclSystem =>
   ['%l,'"   You have two options. Enter:",'%l,_
    '"    ",:bright '"top     ",'"  to return to top level, or",'%l,_
    '"    ",:bright '"break   ",'"  to enter a LISP break loop.",'%l,_
    '%l,'"   Please enter your choice now:"]
 ['%l,'"   You have three options. Enter:",'%l,_
  '"    ",:bright '"continue",'"  to continue processing,",'%l,_
  '"    ",:bright '"top     ",'"  to return to top level, or",'%l,_
  '"    ",:bright '"break   ",'"  to enter a LISP break loop.",'%l,_
  '%l,'"   Please enter your choice now:"]
x := STRING2ID_-N(queryUser msgQ,1)
x := 
  $cclSystem =>
    selectOptionLC(x,'(top break),NIL)
  selectOptionLC(x,'(top break continue),NIL)
null x =>
  sayBrightly bright '"  That was not one of your choices!"
========================================================================

>From the code (since $cclSystem is set to false) we have three options
and not two. On my machine I have only two choices. I added code to
PRINT the value of $cclSystem and $msgQ, something is wrong here
$cclSystem is set to false and msqQ holds the cclSystem message. I do
not have time right now to investigate further so I submit it here,
maybe you can understand what is going on here.

Is it a bug in GCL ? or in Axiom ?

Am I missing something ? 

Greg

PS : To test it issue a ')set break query' followed by a ')lisp ub' for
example.

Could you give more detail on what Axiom is doing for you and what
it to do.  For me it works as follows (both the old release and
newest wh-sandbox):

(1) -> )set break query
(1) -> 1/0

   >> Error detected within library code:
   division by zero

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

   You have three options. Enter:
     continue   to continue processing,
     top        to return to top level, or
     break      to enter a LISP break loop.

   Please enter your choice now:
continue
   Processing will continue where it was interrupted.
(1) ->

You version seems to correctly handle the piece of code I sent. I have
only two choices:

(1) -> 1/0
=20
   >> Error detected within library code:
   division by zero


   You have two options. Enter:
     top        to return to top level, or
     break      to enter a LISP break loop.

   Please enter your choice now:
top
(1) ->=20

It's is on the x86_64 arch. I can reproduce this with gold,
build-improvements and an old one (from Debian).

Anyone who has a x86_64 version of GCL/Axiom can test this ?

Thanks,

Greg

I use x86_64.  My Axiom is based on gcl-2.6.7. One machine is
a Debian and uses system gcl, another one uses gcl-2.6.7 build
separately from sources (I do not use bundled gcl to save build
time).

Both my Fedora Core 3 x86-64 (AMD 3700) version (built from
build-improvements with included gcl-2.6.8pre) and the much
older Windows version (based on gcl-2.6.5, I think) both work
as expected and show 3 options.

Is it possible to retrieve axiom commands?
i.e. if I type in integrate(x**2,x) can I then get
that command back rather than the output from
the command?

I want to retrieve the command from within spad code,
not from the command line

Thanks

Oh ok, that's different. I don't think there is an standard
interface to do this but you can resort to accessing the
underlying Boot/Lisp variable |$currentLine|. See documentation
about the Axiom interpreter "top level loop" here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/interp/IntTopBoot
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/interp/IntintLisp

For example:

(1) -> )lisp (print |$currentLine|)

")lisp (print |$currentLine|)"
Value = ")lisp (print |$currentLine|)"

(2) -> _$currentLine$Lisp

   (2)  _$currentLine$Lisp
                                         Type: Sexpression

In SPAD you can write something like this:

--- File: CommandLine.spad ---
)abbrev package CL CommandLine
CommandLine(): Exports == Implementation where
  Exports ==> with
    current: () -> String
  Implementation ==> add
    current() ==
      -- if $currentLine is a list, command is last entry
      if list?(_$currentLine$Lisp)$SExpression then
        string last(_$currentLine$Lisp)$Lisp
      else
        string _$currentLine$Lisp

--- end ---

(3) -> )co CommandLine.spad
   Compiling AXIOM source code from file
   ...

(3) -> current()$CommandLine
   Loading
      /Documents and Settings/Administrator.ASUS/My Documents/CL.NRLIB/code
      for package CommandLine

   (3)  "current()$CommandLine"
                                         Type: String


Does that help?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Thank you, that's very helpful, although it turns out that 
$internalHistoryTable  has
the information I need, rather than $currentLine.

Great.

Concerning $internalHistoryTable, I worry that this variable
might not always have the information that you need. Consider
the effect of the command:

(1) -> )history )file myhistory
   When the history facility is active, history information will be
      maintained in a file (and not in an internal table).

which is (more and less) described here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/interp/IHistBoot

See also

  )history [ )on | )off ]

Of course, this depends on exactly what and when you want to do
what you want to do. :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Martin,

I prefer to reply to your email on the axiom-developer list rather
that the axiom-user list because I think the issues that you raise
are not so much related to "how to use" Axiom but rather more about
"how Axiom works" and possibly design and re-design. I would like
to invite Thomas to subscribe to one or both of these Axiom email
lists if he has an interest in following further discussion.

Yes I agree, which is the reason I think it is worth some time
to continue this thread on the developer list.

Yes! But of course this is a problem for novice Axiom users. In
comparison with Maple (and most other CA systems), Axiom's focus
on internal representation makes things immediately seem more
complicated then they "need to be". I think this is very bad for
new users.

Secondly, making Axiom's output non-trivially related to the
internal representation creates a barrier and a steep learning
curve since in many cases it turns out that "things are not what
they appear to be". Thus Axiom as it exists today violates the
"principle of least surprise" many times over. Some people treat
this as a challenge while others find it very repulsive to
continued use of Axiom.

I do not agree. Having used Maple extensively I would say that
when using the expand operator I do not have the sense of merely
affecting a desired output. I think it is wrong to say that
"internal representation doesn't matter". Rather it is more that
case that there is only one internal representation - expression -
and one views expand as actively manipulating that representation.
Often one seeks a series of such manipulations that preserve the
algebraic structure but which lead to the desired result, e.g.
prove a theorem or compute some specific unknown.

As soon as you suggest creating new types (domains) for specific
purposes I think you take the discussion beyond what most novice
users are whiling to accept (at least initially). This requires
a kind of "2nd order" thinking about a problem compared to the
usual straight forward analysis that most people apply to problem
solving. So I think it is important to separate "Axiom Users" into
at least two classes: those interested immediate "engineering-
oriented" results, and those willing to invest time and effort
into more general solutions.

Now, surely you realize that when you say "very easy to write",
you are not satisfying the expectations of the original question
which was to presume that a "simple" expand operation in Maple
should have a direct counter-part in Axiom?

I think this result is wonderful but very unconvincing...

I recall that you have in fact presented this very solution
before in the context of a similar question. We previously
discussed the issue of whether it would make sense to
introduce a new domain constructor, say 'distributed' that
would operate in a manner analogous to Axiom's 'factored'
construction. Then one could write for example

  Distributed Expression Integer

But the suggestion that the difference is merely one of
"appearance" of the resulting expression is still very
unsatisfying to me.

Even with Aldor I would not count this as a solution that a novice
Axiom user could possibly apply.

I would like to invite you to explain here in more detail what
you mean.

Personally I think it is a design mistake that Axiom has both a
MultivariatePolynomial domain and DistributedMultivariatePolynomial
domain. I think the model for the domain constructor 'Factored'
should have been followed where we have Polynomial(Integer) and
Factored(Polynomial Integer). Just as in the case of Factored,
the internal representation of Distributed would be different
than the underlying domain, e.g. the representation might be a
List structure those elements come from the underlying domain.
The operations in Distributed have to be "lifted" from the
underlying domain but applied to the new representation.

Then from a novice Axiom User's point of view, the proposed
domain constructor Distributed would (for the most part) just
take the place of Maple's expand operator. Of course in Axiom
there is much more to the story of types and domains then there
is in Maple, but one still has the "feeling" that one is
actively operating a some underlying internal representation
in a transparent and effective manner.

Regards,
Bill Page.

That's exactly why I said that one should make DMP accept arbitrary
variables. Then the problem would go away, and furthermore, one would have an
efficient representation for the desired operations.

I did not say that functionality like "expand" should not be provided. Quite
the opposite, in fact. However, since it is beyond my time to provide a good
solution, I presented a hack, that also shows how to create output you simply
cannot do in Maple et al. For example, I can imagine (but I do not know) that
it might be difficult in certain CAS to expand everything but keep the
denominator factored out. Or expand only with respect to certain variables,
etc.

well, if "extend" were functional, I'd say, it would be really easy to
write. As of current state, I agree. And, again, I fully agree that "expand"
functionality should be present in Axiom.

Well, you should take into account that it took me roughly 3 minutes (one of
them being compiling).

Yes, but the desired output was different then. It kept the denominator
factored out...

I think that the idea of "Factored" is nice, I think I stated this before. I'm
not sure that it is to carry out. Furthermore, I'm not sure that the same idea
would make sense for Distributed.

> But the suggestion that the difference is merely one of "appearance" of the

I did not intend to say that it should be that way. In fact, if you look at
symmetric functions, for example, the internal representation matters a lot. Of
course you can store them as polynomials. But then everything you do will be
horribly inefficient.

My "solution" is a hack, suitable for experimenting.

The signature of SMP is 

SparseMultivariatePolynomial(R: Ring,VarSet: OrderedSet)

while the signature of DMP is

DistributedMultivariatePolynomial(vl,R): public == private where
  vl : List Symbol
  R  : Ring

I'd propose to make it identical to the signature of SMP.

> Personally I think it is a design mistake that Axiom has both a
> MultivariatePolynomial domain and DistributedMultivariatePolynomial domain.

That may well be. Maybe you can try to design such a domain Distributed? I
think, the first steps would be to see which categories the argument has to
satisfy, and how you can "lift" the functionality of the argument domain.

For example, would Distributed EXPR INT provide exponentiation ^: (%, %) -> % ?

If so, what would the result of (a+b)^n be?

Would you provide eval?

eval((a+b)^n, n=3)

Consider:

(1) -> p: POLY INT
                                                                   Type: Void
(2) -> p := a+x + a+y

   (2)  y + x + 2a
                                                     Type: Polynomial Integer
(4) -> factor p

   (4)  y + x + 2a
                                            Type: Factored Polynomial Integer
(5) -> factor eval(p, x=y)

   (5)  2(y + a)
                                            Type: Factored Polynomial Integer
(6) ->  eval(factor p, x=y)

   (6)  2y + 2a
                                            Type: Factored Polynomial Integer

(although, I must admit that this is simply a bug in Factored and could be
easily corrected. Currently it assumes that specializing does not affect
factorization)

How does it work: we split fraction into numerator and denominator, then
split numerator into separate terms (using 'monomials' function).  
We divide each of the terms by the denominator and put an invisible box
around the resulting quotient.  Then we add everything back together.

Some remarks:

1) box operator prevents simplification, so careful when you use it,
   otherwise you may get unexpected results.

2) AFAIK expand command in Maple is really a cheaper version of
   simplify (it is enoungh to simplify polynomials).  More precisely,
   Maple is doing very little (no??) simplification by default,
   so you may have a complicated expression which is really 0.
   Expand gives you "canonical" form for polynomials -- if two
   polynomials are mathematically equal then the expanded forms
   are equal.  This is not needed in Axiom, Axiom normally keeps
   polynomials (and rational functions) in "canonical" form.
   If for some reasons other forms are preferable Axiom offers
   some extra domains (like Factored).

3) AFAIU what you really want is a way to control how results are
   printed.  IIRC Axiom gives only very limited control over
   formatting the output.

4) In general each systems has hardcoded ideas what looks best, and
   it can be frustrating trying (with no effect) to match output of
   the other system.
 
5) IMHO your Maple solution, the command I gave and Bill Page DMP
   trick are really abuses: all of the commands perform some
   computation and the change in printed output is a byproduct
   (possibly unintended).  I wrote above about Maple expand.
   Axiom DMP was implemented to allow efficient computation of
   Groebner bases (and some similar computation).  I know very
   little about box operator, but I suspect that it main intended
   use was _not_ to control printing.

Excellent! I think it is a clever solution. It is more
transparent than Martin's DistributedExpression solution and
it uses some operations that a novice Axiom user might already
understand and find useful for other purposes.

But an explanation is still required about the use of the
Expression domain versus polynomials and the choices that the
Axiom interpreter makes in this case.

Perhaps you meant to say "evaluation" rather than "simplification".
It is misleading to take about simplification in this context.
It seems to me that Axiom never attempts any simplification as
such. It simply applies each operator that it selects based on
contextual and explicit type information as it parses some input.
The result of the calculation is a member of some domain which
may have an associated "canonical" OutputForm that appears similar
to an simplification of the input expression but really has nothing
directly to do with expression manipulation.

I think it is better to say that 'box' (and the related operator
'paren' in ES) simply remain unevaluated and have a particular
associated OutputForm. But the arguments of box, and expressions
involving box, are in fact evaluated by Axiom as the example below
shows.

Indeed! For example

(16) -> box(1+2)+box(3)

   (16)  23
                                       Type: Expression Integer

[Note: This must be read a 2 * 3.]

(17) -> %::InputForm

   (17)  (* 2 (%box 3))
                                               Type: InputForm

How to "unbox" an expression?

Rather than speaking about "canonical forms", it is more accurate
to say that Axiom choices a particular internal representation for
each domain.

I would also add "like DistributedMultivariatePolynomial". See

I disagree that the original intent of the question was necessarily
limited to "control how results are printed". The author asked:
"how do I expand an expression" as in the context of Maple. The
reason why one might want to manipulate an expression this way was
not stated but it certainly might include showing that two expressions
are equal such as you implied above.

As Martin's example showed, that is not true. Axiom's OutputForm
domain provides a very rich formatting environment (at the cost
of some programming in SPAD).

In Axiom I think it is important to realize that an "object" (i.e.
an member of a domain) has both an internal representation (hidden
except for the explicit operations exported by the interface) and
an external appearance as "hardcoded" by a particular coercion to
the OutputForm domain. How much of this one can or should say to a
novice Axiom user, I am uncertain. But everything else I have seen
written so far seems misleading to me.

I object to the phrase "trick" and "abuse". It seems to me that
what you, I and Martin wrote as "solutions" make good sense in
the appropriate context. I am not sure why you would claim that
the intended use of DMP is limited to efficient computation of a
given kind, however I agree of course that the choice of internal
representation of a domain does have a big impact on efficiency of
a given algorithm.

Clearly it is an operation in Axiom that is intended to facilitate
the manipulation of members of the Expression domain in (more or
less) the manner which you demonstrated. That his affects how
expressions are printed seems to me to be a natural consequence.

I've been looking deeply into the problem of using a web browser
as the front end for axiom. There are 3 components:

1) replace the graphics
2) replace hyperdoc
3) make an interactive front end

Consider problem 1, replace the graphics.

Currently our graphics are written in C and use X11.
The graphics program is really a standalone C program that
communicates to the rest of the system thru sman.

X11 has been a problem because we cannot port this to windows easily.
I did manage to get hyperdoc working on windows using an X11 hosting
program but decided that this was not a good long term solution and
never released it.

Architecturally the choice of making the graphics engine exist outside
of the underlying lisp system has limitations. I would much rather see
a closer integration between the computations and their display so that
the display could be dynamic instead of static graphs. And it should be
possible to create new domains that directly manipulate axiom data
structures that can be drawn directly. A standalone C program is not
a good choice for this.

I've been investigating new browser technology that will allow us to
draw the graphics on a web page in several formats. The first attempt
was to create flash files (an open format) directly from lisp so that
we could write a flash file which had moving graphics (e.g. a moving
wave image). This proved to be painful and I stopped.

Recently a new html tag <canvas> has been implemented. I've been playing
with this tag and it appears to support all of the drawing primitives we
need to do the 2D graphics. Axiom already does the 3D->2D work.

Another recent (well, recent to me) development has been the AJAX
architecture. This allows a web page to dynamically and periodically
communicate to a host without changing the page. This is how google
does tricks like google earth.

So combining these two technologies will allow us to run an axiom
process that communicates with a local or remote browser and can
dynamically draw shapes on the webpage.

The low level task is to refactor the C code into display and
data handling. The display primitives get pushed out to javascript.
The data handling gets sucked into lisp. The C code disappears.

I'm putting together code to do an example for this and I'd like
feedback about the idea and the direction.



Consider problem 2, replace hyperdoc.

I've already coded portions of hyperdoc in javascript and am now
learning AJAX so that I can fetch pages and images from an axiom
session. Also in plan is to be able to dynamically show results
from the axiom session when looking up search and query information.

Hyperdoc used to have its own language for display but this is dead
and gone. I've been recoding the hyperdoc pages into html so they
use a standard format. This will allow anyone to code web pages without
any training. It should also allow us to embed pamphlets as pdf in pages.

The low level task is to recode the hyperdoc info into html and
javascript (in process), factor in new function for handling 
pamphlets and hyperlinking to non-axiom data, and using either
mathml or some other smooth symbol output.

Hyperdoc can display both static (easy) and dynamic (somewhat harder)
graphics output so I'm stalled on the conversion while I work thru 
the graphics details.




Consider problem 3, make an interactive front end

Given AJAX it should be possible to type into a web page, send the
input to axiom, html (mathml?) the output, and display the result.
This will take a bit of surgery on the axiom display internals and
is queued behind the first two problems.

The low level task involves rewriting the front end to do I/O
thru the web interface instead of a pty, killing off sman, and
making the I/O controllable by spad code.



The goal is to have a working browser-based front end to axiom
that works on any platform or across the net by next year.

By design all of the C code disappears and all work is done
inside the lisp image. The actual functions will be implemented
at the axiom/spad language level so that users can have complete
control of I/O directly in spad. 

So the overall redesign calls for a lisp-only, browser fronted
axiom which uses html (maybe mathml, undecided), javascript and
a general browser (or any network program). All of the C code dies.
All of the hyperdoc language/machinery dies. Sman dies. All axiom
code is just a single lisp image.




Problem 4 is to move on to making the front end and back end
reflect the crystal/facet design. More about that when the first
3 parts begin to work.




Design suggestions and discussion are welcome.

Tim

HyperDoc also shows the API of SPAD programs, in particular the ++ 
comments. I know that you tend to remove the ++ stuff in favour of 
literate programs, but their may be people (like me) who want to have 
both. I would rather like to see a concise API description from where I 
can quickly see that the function does what I would like it to do. Of 
course that doesn't prevent us from putting a link to the actual 
literate program part of the function into the API description. (Note 
that I don't want to get rid of the literate programming idea, I just 
want a different view on the documentation that pretty much looks like 
an API description.)

Since you want to bring the documentation to html, what do you expect as 
the input? If hyperdoc goes away, I probably guess rightly, that you 
also want to remove hypertex, right?

X11 problem should be easy to solve:  use portable drawing library.
It looks that SDL should work for us.  In fact, we want to remove
direct X11 dependency in order to allow generating images in server
setting (when Axiom has no access to X server).

AFAICS standalone program was used because multithreading is available
only in some Lisps.  The point is that you do not want to handle
interaction in the same thread that may be doing heavy computation.
Of course, putting interaction in web browser separates it from Lisp,
but then you have back limitations due to separate graphic engine.

You mean: the Axiom C code in graphic subdirectory does the 3D->2D work.

The graphic code is actually to some degree separated.  There is (small)
part that supports graphic primitives, data handling part which converts
vector type specificaton send by AXIOMsys into primitives and interactive
part (responsible for user interaction).  Bad thing is that interactive
part passes modifies in rather unstructured way parameters used for
data conversion.  Also, data convertion needs color information and
takes it from X server (even for Postscript output).

Hyperdoc uses essentialy _the same_ TeX notation as Axiom book (and
contains the same material).  IMHO this property should be preserved:
online and printed Axiom meterial should use the same sources.  
If current format in inconvenient it is Axiom book which should be
recoded.  For Web access we need a translator which converts our
format to HTML.

I still think that there is a better alternative than using a browser as a 
front-end - GNU TeXmacs. Browsers are big and inefficient (especially 
things like javascript); the quality of formulas is not really good. 
There are exactly 2 programs which cac display high-quality maths - TeX 
and TeXmacs, but TeX is non-interactive (attempts to run latex on each 
output line are terribly inefficient). TeXmacs can easily replace hyperdoc 
- it already has practically all the needed functionality, though sending 
commands to Axiom for execution will require some programming (not very 
much).

About graphics: the current graphics has a good feature that I can 
interact with a plot (to a limited extent) by mouse and menus, without 
re-running Axiom commands. I think this is very valuable, and should be 
much extended. Ideally, I should be able to rotate, zoom, change scale 
along each axis, change axis labelling, place light sources, chenge 
textures of surfaces, etc. etc., and produce a live plot of a ray-tracer 
quality. All of this is not possible in a browser. This requires opengl. 
So, moving to a browser interface seems to me a big step backwards.

Yes, a more close coupling between graphics and computations is very 
valuable. But why a browser? Its connection to Axiom computation engine is 
very week.

This is by far insufficient for highly interactive high-quality graphics.

Isn't it a way to spend a lot of resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) for 
nothing?

Yes, if you are prepared to wait as long as for getting some responce from 
google earth (with network bandwidths outside USA, it is terrible).

Javascript is 100 - 1000 times less efficient than C. Also, no opengl, no 
interactivity, etc.

> Consider problem 2, replace hyperdoc.
As I said, TeXmacs can do everything hyperdoc does. Now. A few lines of 
scheme code are needed to send commands back to Axiom.

Pamphlets are LaTeX (or at least they should be, if your excellent idea of 
\begin{chunk} ... \end{chunk} will become reality). TeXmacs can display 
LaTeX (and hence pamphlets) directly, without pdf. It can also edit them 
in a wysiwyg fashiom, which you cannot do with pdf.

Also, re-coding hyperdoc pages to LaTeX should be easier than to html, and 
LaTeX is (from my point of view) a better language. It is already used in 
pamphlet files. Why introduce html for the help system? Why not to use 
LaTeX here too?

TeXmacs can display static and dynamic graphics with equal ease, if it's 
.eps (or can be converted to .eps).

So much inefficient machinery for so simple task!

TeXmacs can send commands to Axiom right now. Currently, the communication 
in the opposite direction is done by Axiom generating LaTeX and TeXmacs 
displaying it. This should be changed. Serialization of formulas produced 
by Axiom via LaTeX, mathml or whatever is inefficient and loses important 
information. Parsing this text stream in a front-end is a senseless work, 
and should be eliminated. It is easy to output Axiom expressions as 
s-expressions, and to send them to TeXmacs, without losing any information 
about their internal structure and semantics. TeXmacs can understand and 
display formulas sent as s-expressions. Some small adjustments are needed, 
of course: TeXmacs expects s-expressions formed according to some (rather 
natural) rules. But it is, of course, *much* easier to write generation of 
such s-expressions than generation of LaTeX or mathml.

Deth of C code, Lisp image only - this is good. But I am against browsers, 
mathml, javascript (which is as bad as C and *very* inefficient).

GNU TeXmacs is free and available on all platforms (recently, a Mac port 
with a native MacOS interface appeared, but I cannot comment on it because 
I don't have a Mac). It has an additional advantage: it is used as an 
interface to Axiom, maxima, yacas, Mathematica, Maple, REDUCE, MuPAD, 
Pari/GP, macaulay2, octave, scilab, matlab, R, ... (the list is too long 
to continue). A user can cut-and-paste between systems (for example, I can 
derive some large matrix in Axiom, and then to copy the Axiom output to 
Octave input for further efficient numerical diagonalization). Some 
improvements in TeXmacs will benefit many systems, not just Axiom. For 
example, I am sure that intelligent line-breaking for long output formulas 
should be written in scheme inside TeXmacs, then it will be used by Axiom, 
maxima, etc. etc.

To conclude: I think TeXmacs should become an official front-end for 
Axiom. If a browser front-end is an inevitable evil in our age, TeXmacs 
should become an official front-end number 2.

Best wishes and many thanks,
Andrey

Qt is available under windows

and so is FLTK

I'm not quit convinced yet that the idea of removing the all the C
codes from Axiom is a good idea.

Dear Tim,

Although I'm happy that you are working on the documentation issues, I must say
that I'm extremely concerned about your approach to

> 2) replace hyperdoc

and, maybe most importantly, about our (i.e., mine and your) communication with
respect to these things. I very much hope that I misunderstood you.

As you know, Ralf has written an excellent environment for literate programs,
called ALLPROSE. (Environment is not entirely correct, in principle it consists
of some programs that convert your literate program into documentation and
code, plus some LaTeX environments that are not so different from HyperTeX's
ideas, but in contrast to them very well documented. I'd say that they are as
easy to use.)

Meanwhile, I use his conventions also to document my spad code, although I
cannot use all features of ALLPROSE there. (I hope everybody knows by know that
we managed to use ALLPROSE directly for Axiom programs written in Aldor, in
this setting, all of ALLPROSE works very nicely)

Some time ago I asked you whether asq could be used to fetch the documentation
information also dynamically, i.e., after a file has been compiled within the
axiom environment. This would be important to mimick a strong feature of
HyperDoc: After compiling a bunch of spad files with ")co file", all the
documentation is found by HyperDoc!

I faintly remember that you answered, that this would be easy, but I never
heard any further response.

I am very much concerned about this paragraph. In fact, if html is going to be
used for documentation rather than LaTeX, I'll immediately quit the project. I
cannot find any sane reason to give up these concepts from ALLPROSE and
HyperDoc. Finally, I don't see any reason to embed pdf in pages when we can
generate html automatically. Browsers are made to display html, not pdf, I'd
guess.

> The low level task is to recode the hyperdoc info into html and javascript

Could you please be more specific here? What do you mean by hyperdoc info? The
api currently written within the ++ environments? The example pages? If this is
the case, you have nearly lost me. Why don't you use tex4ht to translate
HyperTeX to html?

Dynamic api-documentation given the literate program is an absolute must for
me. To this end, given the name of a function or constructor, a hyperdoc
replacement would need to be able to

* fetch the +++ environment corresponding to this constructor from the literate
  program or a database compiled from the literate program, as it is done now
  (libdb.text)

* render the documentation written therein, hyperlinked of course.

Here is an example what is currently put into libdb.text:

cFormalPowerSeriesCategory`1`x`(Ring)->Category`(R)`FORMALP`\begin{adusage}
Foo: \adthistype{} Integer with {...} == add {...}    \end{adusage}    \begin{addescription}{The category of formal power series.}      \adthistype{} is the category of \useterm{formal power series} of      the form      \begin{gather}        f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {f_n x^n}.      \end{gather}    \end{addescription}

This was generated from:

\begin{+++}
  \begin{adusage}
    Foo: \adthistype{} Integer with {...} == add {...}
  \end{adusage}
  \begin{addescription}{The category of formal power series.}
    \adthistype{} is the category of \useterm{formal power series} of
    the form
    \begin{gather}
      f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty {f_n x^n}.
    \end{gather}
  \end{addescription}
\end{+++}

Of course, HyperDoc complains when trying to display that:

Unknown begin type \begin{adusage} 
While parsing T71
Trying to print the next ten tokens
\} Foo \: \ 1027  \{ \} Integer with \{ \. 

An important remark is that, apart from being put into libdb.text, the above
documentation snippet also appears in the "full" documentation, properly
hyperlinked and colored, of course.

--excursion--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to see that file, say

svn co svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat/trunk

cd combinat/trunk/combinat

notangle -t8 Makefile.nw > Makefile

make dvi

or

make colored dvi

or, if you have tex4ht installed,

make colored html

--excursion--------------------------------------------------------------------

Tim, maybe you could try to build upon these things? Maybe you could use the
above documentation snippet to elaborate on your ideas: How would you like to
have this written? (I hope, not html?) I guess that it would be possible to
convert it to some other format (automatically, of course), before it is put
into the (currently libdb.text) database. In fact, I think that this is the
place where we would need somebody with your knowledge and abilities. Maybe you
can look at ALLPROSE and find out how to turn it into a hyperdoc replacement.

Note that ALLPROSE can output a huge variety of formats: dvi, pdf, ps, html,
mathml, html+jsmath, ... (Of course this is a half lie, since really ALLPROSE
knows only LaTeX. But Ralf's command of tex4ht is quite good...)

After having said "make html", "cd doc" and "myfavoritebrowser combinat.html",
click on "FormalPowerSeriesCategory" (it's Section number is 11.2) for an
excellent example!

I dislike C and like Lisp, too. But I have the feeling that throwing away
C code should not be a goal per se.



I very much hope that I could make my concerns understood.

Hi,

  I see  that there has been some effort invested in rewriting the
Boot codes in Lisp. I believe that is a fundamental mistake.  Even
though Boot is a syntactic sugar over Lisp, it apears through
experiments I conducted here on (non-representative) sample that
students get quickly their mind wrapped around the Boot code than the
Lisp equivalent; mostly -- I suspect -- because of the structural
pattern matching, and structured Boot operators.

Any reason not to consider fboundp?  Also I seem to remember Camm said
GCL has built-in autoload capabilities.  Since we're (un)fortunately
deeply rooted into GCL, why not consider that?

We currently have at least two Spad parsers (and same for Boot).  And
at least as many grammars (not always in sync).  And least twice parse
tree processors.  That is recipe for confusion.  We should aim for
decreasing duplications.

Could you elaborate? I do not understand how fboundp and GCL autoload can
help for Aldor translator problem.

I was addressing the specific issue of ensuring that a function

Martin, I think you should not be overly concerned about Tim's
proposal since it seems to me that there is near zero likelihood
that any of this work will ever be completed. On the other hand
it is highly discouraging to me to see that such a potentially
major contributor to Axiom development as Tim should continue to
so badly miss-direct his efforts. But we have had this sort of
discussion before :-( so let me continue in a more postive manner.

Personally I am very much in favour of Andrey's recommendation to
re-consider the use of TeXmacs as a front-end to Axiom. TeXmacs
has an enormous potential that is mostly unused by the current
Axiom interface. Allowing Axiom to work in a seamless worksheet-
type interface mediated by a mathematically literate document
processor that uses Scheme (a Lisp variant) as it's internal
scripting language seems like an obvious perfect match. And
TeXmacs has a respectable user base, some of whom might well be
motivated to help with improving the Axiom interface.

I should mention here also the Sage interface to Axiom. Sage
shares some of the goals of TeXmacs in as much as it attempts to
provide a uniform interface to a wide range of computer algebra
systems. Sage already supports a browser-based worksheet user
interface (called a Notebook) which allows Axiom (and many other
systems) to be used both "natively" and in Sage's "cooked" mode
which provides a uniform python object-oriented syntax and
programming language. Sage is being very aggressively developed
by it's designer (William Stein) and a small army of volunteers.
I think improving the current Axiom interface to Sage would help
to ensure that Axiom remains well represented in this new world.

Note: Most recently the Sage developers seem to be focusing on
documentation issues that are very close in spirit to the work
done by Ralf Hemmecke in ALLPROSE although with very different
tools.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Interesting set of replies. 

Ralf is concerned that we would not have API documentation,
which is quite reasonable. We extract the existing
documentation automatically so I don't believe there is any
difference caused by displaying this documentation in a
standard browser rather than hyperdoc. The documentation 
strings are extracted by the compiler and should be available
from the database files or the running image if we so desire.

I agree that we ought to carefully study the API documentation
issue. Possibly we could adopt a new syntax similar to javadoc
that allows us to use existing tools. Failing that we could
probably dynamically generate API documentation at compile
time that would be properly hyperlinked and easy to display.




Waldek says: "X11 problem should be easy to solve..."
except that it is not. I have experimented with making
the graphics and hyperdoc run on windows, freebsd, and
the mac. Each one has had its own problems, windows being
the hardest. I did succeed in getting hyperdoc running on
windows but there is no chance the average user wants to
put up with the pain of installing and using it. And it
won't talk to sman so it has limited functionality.

"... use portable drawing library"... which is exactly the
plan. The graphics needs to be split into two parts, the
drawing algorithms and the drawing technology. The algorithms
need to be placed where they can be manipulated, rewritten,
and extended by spad code. The drawing technology needs to
be more portable. The most portable drawing technology I've
found uses <canvas> tags in a browser window. Write once,
draw anywhere, locally or over a network, windows, linux,
freebsd, or mac. 

"...multithreading is available only in some lisps..."
depends on the granularity of the processes. I've looked
into this and SBCL multithreads on all platforms. I have yet
to try this with web connections but it does work otherwise.
And this assumes that you use threading rather than tasks.
It is possible to create a separate, generated lisp object
to handle each display task and start each one as a standalone
task in a separate image, dedicate to the single graph.

"Hyperdoc uses essentially _the same_ TeX notation as the book..."
It does? The book contains nothing about pages or buttons.
It says nothing about the requirements for free references
to prior values. Certain portions of the information are
derived from certain portions of the book and there is every
reason for this to continue. But I have seen no effort to
create whole new subtrees of hyperdoc pages. Trying to embed
flash, sound, movies, jpgs, pdfs, and links to external movies 
cannot happen. Hyperdoc does not support pamphlet files.
All of this would require extensive programming. But everyone
has a free viewer on every desktop that supports all of this
functionality called a browser.

I agree that the graphics needs to be more portable, easier
to manipulate from spad, threaded or tasked in such a way 
that it is responsive to zoom/translate/rotate/shade, etc.

I'm not sure that I agree about the exact syntax of the hyperdoc
files, however. The hyperdoc language was invented before URLs,
html, ajax, etc. and really limits what you can put on a page.
Plus it is a one-of-a-kind language which limits the number of
likely authors. Since writing documentation is vital this is a
huge limitation.




Andrey suggests that TeXmacs "...is a better alternative than using
a browser as a front-end...". I agree with this in theory but I'm
not sure it holds up in practice. TeXmacs has limitations (e.g.
displaying graphics) but that's only a minor issue. TeXmacs has
been available for at least 6 years and attached to Axiom for
about 4 years. Yet I know of no-one who actively uses it as a
front end for Axiom. I don't even see it show up when people
demo TeXmacs at conferences.

"...the current graphics has a good feature that I can interact
with a plot...", "...this is not possible in a browser." In fact,
it is possible in a browser (as of Firefox 1.5) which is the 
piece I've been waiting for. I've done some experiments to 
convince myself that it works. I've even see MS paint in a
browser (http://canvaspaint.org). 

"...a close coupling between graphics and computations is very 
valuable...". I want to be able to have a continuously varying
stream of information displayed as a computation proceeds. Or
I want to have a graph data structure drawn in real time as
the program manipulates the graph data structure (the krops
network at the center of the crystal)

"...but why a browser? Its connection to Axiom computation engine
is very week". Well, everyone has a browser, they know how to use
it and they would know immediately how to interact with Axiom.
It is possible to do things like "folding" (similar to mathematica
notebooks) without having special programs. It is possible to
connect locally or remotely with no visible difference. 

"...if you are prepared to wait as long as for getting some responce
from google earth..". Actually I suspect that Axiom will be running
on the same machine as the browser in most instances. In that case
bandwidth is not an issue. As for CPU resources I can't seem to buy
a machine these days that has a single CPU, the very latest
machines are quad-core machines and I saw today that the next 
Intel/AMD machines are 8-way processors. Multiprocess machines
will be common in the near future.

"...Javascript is 100-1000 times less efficient than C..."
This way lies a religious war. Believe me, I dislike Javascript
as much as everyone else but it works and it does what I need to do.
I've rewritten portions of Hyperdoc into Javascript functions and
it provides the machinery I need. C does not, so it doesn't matter.

"...TeXmacs can do everything hyperdoc does"? Really? Not that
I'm aware of. Hyperdoc embeds images and can communicate commands
to Axiom and then display the resulting images inline (and start
up a separate process if you click on the image). I have no doubt
that TeXmacs COULD do this but I do doubt that it is on anyone's
desk to make this happen in the next year.

"Also, re-coding hyperdoc pages to LaTeX should be easier than to
html..." If we ignore handling text, LaTeX and html are 
worlds apart. Html handles user interaction for input and output.
LaTeX formats text and equations and the occasional picture. They
are not "either-or" choices and both can exist together.

"...It is easy to output Axiom expressions as s-expressions, and to
send them to TeXmacs, without losing any information about their 
internal structure and semantics...". This can't be done. The
semantics of the parts of the expressions have machine-level
pointers to domain data structures which point to other domain
data structure which index into other domain data structures, etc.
Once the pointer leaves the Axiom image it is meaningless and all
of Axiom's meaning comes from the domain where the expression lives.
Thus it is not possible to export an s-expression with all of its
semantics intact.

"...but I'm against browsers...". See the Axiom mailing list archives.
I agreed with you two years ago. Bill Page convinced me otherwise and
I've been looking at a way to use browsers for a long time. With the
introduction of the <canvas> tag the last piece of the puzzle has
fallen into place for me. I'm still undecided about mathml but I've
seen some very pretty formula work in it so my opinion may change
as I learn more.

"...TeXmacs is free and available for all platforms..." but so is
Firefox. 





Gaby writes "Qt is available under windows". There are several
approaches I've looked at in terms of portable graphics code.
The most promising approach was to use Tcl/TK. We had a bit of
discussion about this with Camm on the mailing list sometime
last year. I built a small Tcl/TK version of hyperdoc but could
not get it to run properly from GCL. I looked at Glade this past
summer and built a few hyperdoc pages. Glade can generate windows
for any platform from description files. But it also didn't work
well with lisp. I got a copy of Visual C++ and tried to build a
few native windows on Windows XP. That way lies madness. I used
an X11 emulation program on the MS window for X11. I've been
experimenting with different systems for the past year and none of
them have been sufficient, although it was a great learning experience.





Martin writes: "...Ralf has written an excellent environment for
literate programs...". Yes, he showed it to me in France and I'm
really quite impressed. I'm not sure what this has to do with
the front-end issues to Axiom, however. 


"Some time ago I asked you whether asq could be used to fetch 
the documentation information also dynamically...I faintly 
remember you answered but I never heard any further response."
I put up a web page that used asq to provide access to database
information from the web and I believe I passed it on to Bill
Page for inclusion on the wiki. The details are likely in the
mailing list somewhere. The web page I built for you is at:
http://daly.axiom-developer.org/asq.php


"...I cannot find any sane reason to give up these concepts from
ALLPROSE and Hyperdoc..."? Somehow you see using a browser to
access information from a back end as implying that we have to
give up our programming tools. I'm not sure why these two things
seem to be related. The fact that Axiom uses a different front end
should have no effect on what tools you use to write programs.


"...Dynamic api-documentation is a must for me..." and is clearly
a requirement for any front end. Given that the browser front end
would be speaking directly to an Axiom image why do you believe
that we wouldn't have dynamic information? You show libdb.text
information and then claim that hyperdoc will not display it.
Is tex4ht the right tool? I have no idea as I have not tried it.
Supposedly noweb will also generate html. There are many migration
paths to think about and explore. If I knew the answers I'd be
writing production code rather than these many throw-away experiments.






Bill Page writes "...I think you should not be overly concerned
about Tim's proposal since it seems to me that there is near zero
likelihood that any of this work will be completed...". ummm, ok.
I'll accept that insult and move on.

"... as Tim should continue to so badly miss-direct his efforts..."
Before the first release of the Axiom source code I decided that
documentation, both of the existing code and the new code, the way
to interact with documentation, documenting the algebra hierarchy
and documenting the algebra theory were vitally important. Since
that time most of my efforts have been directed toward documentation.
Several years ago I recreated the original book and about 13 months
ago I completed and published the first volume of axiom documentation.
Most recently, and soon to be released, is a several chapter booklet
documenting the quaterion domain. I'm not sure what you think my
efforts are directed toward but I've been pursuing this goal for
years and plan to continue.

"..I am very much in favour of Andrey's recommendation to re-consider
the use of TeXmacs...". Axiom has been available for 5 years or so.
TeXmacs has also been available for that time. Both have been connected
for several years. Name 3 people worldwide who develop Axiom code on
TeXmacs. I'd bet you do not.

"...Sage supports browser-based worksheets...which allow Axiom...
to be used both "natively"..." and from this you conclude that 
having a browser front end to Axiom is mis-directed?




Anyway, thank you all for the feedback.

Tim

If this is what you intend, great. I did mention that I'd hope everything was a
big misunderstanding on my part.

So, what's wrong with the conventions used by ALLPROSE (they come from AlDoc
and AldorDoc...) ? Furthermore, they are quite close to HyperTeX... What more
can you want? You can put everything (graphics, videos, text) in the api you
like, of course. LaTeX is quite flexible.

I'd be surprised if you could manage to create a (paper-printed copy of a) book
that contains buttons :-) But why shouldn't we use the same "language" for both
the browser and the book. I think, that's the spirit of HyperTeX. By the way,
MuPAD uses quite a similar philosophy.

I'm repeatedly saying that I only want *one* set of conventions for writing
documentation and code. And I'm absolutely convinced that this should be LaTeX
like. Ralf has shown that this can be done, in a very user friendly manner.

But that's not what I meant with "dynamic". I meant (and I hope I explained)
that I want asq or (any hyperdoc replacement) be able to use freshly generated
databases. I like your web page very very much, I think it is a great proof of
concept.

Great. I was only afraid that you want me to write api documentation - possible
also other documentation, I did not understand that part - in a language other
than LaTeX, or with a set of conventions different from those used for the rest
of the documentation. If this is not the case, I'm entirely happy.

I think it's time to set a price again. I'll pay 100$ anyone who writes a new,
or modifies an existing program, that displays the documentation of a +++
environment (and only this bit of documentation) as generated by ALLPROSE, on
demand, i.e., using a web interface similar to that Tim provided.

To get started, do the following

----------------------------------------------------------------------

svn co svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat/trunk

cd combinat/trunk/combinat

notangle -t8 Makefile.nw > Makefile

make VARIANTSTOBUILD=axiom

cd lib

for f in $(ar t libcombinatax.al); do ar x libcombinatax.al $f; done
for f in $(ar t libcombinatax.al); do echo ")lib $f" >> combinat.input; done

cd ../src

axiom

-- now everything of combinat is available. To generate a libdb.text say

)se co args "-O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y $AXIOM/algebra -i ../include"

)co csseries
----------------------------------------------------------------------
(very likely, there is an easier way to generate the libdb file.)

To explain the process a bit: (Ralf, please correct me if I'm wrong)

  make VARIANTSTOBUILD=axiom

extracts using noweb documentation and code from the source files, for example
series.as.nw. All of the code and the api description (i.e., everything between
\begin{+++} ... \end{+++} ) is put into a file csseries.as.

")co csseries" is one way to extract the +++ strings and write them into
libdb.text.

The best thing would be, of course, if one could simply call tex4ht on the
individual +++ strings. One would have to write a suitable LaTeX preamble, of
course, that \usepackages the appropriate style files. However, I do not know
how hyperlinking will work then. (In fact, I don't even understand hyperlinking
within ALLPROSE, and Ralf begs me to read the documentation since a few
months...)

Maybe it also makes sense to run a preprocessor over the literate
program. I.e., to modify ALLPROSE so that preprocecessed LaTeX (for example
html) is put into a database. But I would like the other solution better.

It would already be a great thing if doc could be displayed without
hyperlinks. That shouldn't be too hard, I believe.

> Is tex4ht the right tool? I have no idea as I have not tried it.

PLEASE try it. It produces just wonderful results. I admit, though, that I
myself found it difficult to set up. However, I'm sure you'll get help if you
ask for it.

> Supposedly noweb will also generate html. 

What? I thought noweb simply extracts code and documentation, thus preparing
for LaTeX / TeX and Aldor / SPAD / C / Perl / whatever ?

Sorry Tim, I did not mean any insult to you. I just think you are
being terribly unrealistic. If I had announced that I intended
to learn Ocaml and re-write all of Axiom in my spare time, and
someone replied: "Surely I must have misunderstood you!" then I
would expect a similar response.

Great. I think your efforts to document Axiom are VERY worthwhile
and I appreciate all of the time and effort that you have put into
this. When I referred to miss-directed efforts, I meant things
like rewriting Boot and C source code into Lisp and combining
separate source modules into awkward single monolithic "volumes" -
time that could be devoted to documenting Axiom internals. After
all Tim, you are one of the only remaining vocal members of this
project who actually worked on the original Axiom project at IBM
and wrote some of this code.

I am not too excited by documentation for the quaternion domain
but it might have some value if it serves as a model that other
people can follow for documenting more Axiom's algebra. But the
problem here is motivating other people to do this sort of thing.
I don't see that happening at all and it worries me.

The original Axiom interface for TeXmacs was written when Axiom
was a commercial product. I ported the NAG Axiom tutorial to
TeXmacs as one of the first things I did with Axiom and I wrote
a new Axiom interface for TeXmacs on Windows. There have been
several people asking about TeXmacs and Axiom since then, but
yes 3 or 4 might be the right number. I might use TeXmacs if I
found a need to actually use Axiom for some printed publication
but out of familiarity I prefer the Axiom Wiki (mathaction) web
interface for most things I want other people to see. For Axiom
development usually I use only Axiom and a text editor in a
console session.

The reason why I favour an effort directed toward improving the
existing Axiom interface for TeXmacs is a strategic one - I think
there are people who would be motivated to learn more about Axiom
because they like the idea of WYSIWYG mathematical document
processing with access to computer algebra tools. Some people
certainly learn about Maxima this way. I think the interest in
Axiom would be greater if the Axiom interface for TeXmacs was
better.

No I am still very much also in favour of the type of browser front
end for Axiom that Kai Kaminski worked on almost two years ago.
I do think a browser front end for Axiom is a good idea -
particularly if it scales easily from desktop to public web server.
My point in part was that this has already largely been done, at
least in so much as the Sage interface to Axiom exposes Axiom to
the Sage Notebook interface. None of this involved re-writing any
existing Axiom source code. I think it makes good sense to continue
to build on this work.

I definitely don't think it makes good sense for the Axiom project
to proceed in the manner outlined in your statement of plans. But
this is a volunteer open source project and you have your own
interests and agenda, so my opinions need not have much impact on
how you actually spend your time. Anyway I think you have already
done the greatest possible service just by making Axiom available
as open source. What's next is up to all of us.

Bill Page.

I do not know how many people in this list have used Axiom via the Sage
notebook. Like you said I think using their notebook is a better idea than
starting from scratch. Their notebook uses much of the AJAX magic that
Tim would like to have for Axiom. We could ask William for permission to
use it (not that is necessary given that is open source, but it is a good
gesture) and patch it for Axiom needs, just like Sage does with Pyrex.
I think given that Tim would like this by next year, this will reduce the
development time by months.

Other things then can be addressed is Martin's concern about the
+++ documentation. I also would like also to have this to create something
similar to javadocs or python style, in which you can get the api without having
to read the whole literate document, if want you want is just a quick
info. I know
the Sage notebook allows to display latex already but I do not know if it has a
good rendering. Also the d&d pamphlet feature can be addressed.

The link in the frontpage of MathAction:
http://sage-notebook.axiom-developer.org/106 does not point to useful
Axiom
examples like you had before, maybe  you can fix this. Tim probably can look at
it, and see if this is what he would like to have. I think this work
could attract more
contributors.

Regards,

Alfredo

PS: On another note, with the help of Ralf's ideas, I started writing
a Gedit plugin
to allow Literate programming. Currently I have a basic prototype working:

https://alfredoportes.com/~alfredo/lp.png

You can click on a button and the documentation gets extracted and
compiled using noweb and latex. I plan to add also something similar
to what Bill has on MathAction to extract the chunks of code.

This is just a trial and error, but my final goal is to actually
write a plugin for Eclipse
to allow literate programming, so it feels natural writing a pamphlet
inside of it, without loosing the features provided by the IDE or
other plugins (auto compiling, class browser, etc).

Dear all,

I use axiom in a emacs with an axiom-mode which accepts multilines commands
  in automatics temporary files,
or in a xterm for short tests.
I don't use texmacs because 
  I prefer the << light >> emacs to the CPU-eater texmacs.
I'll use the sage interface iff it's possible to hide the sage interpreter.
  I don't want to type 
    SageResustl = axiom ("axiomVar := sum (q^k, k=0..n)")
  but only type axiomVar := sum (q^k, k=0..n) in sage interface.

I can't do exercices for my students in a xterm, 
axiom in a xterm looks like mupad-light, it's not a great interface.
But the other systems (emacs, texmacs or sage) are possible.

I might use but I don't use the hyper-doc.
I prefer grep in the *.spad files 
and find very precious short help after +++.

When I used mupad I got the list of all the mupad-functions and 
it was easy to complete a function name or a domain by the [tab] key. 
It was nice. My emacs interface for mupad get also the man-page in emacs
and could copy examples from the help to the session.

The sage project has very pretty draw abilities.
Perhaps it'll be possible to export from axiom list of points, surfaces, 
curves and get beautiful plots thanks to sage.

I don't use plot functions in axiom because it's difficult to draw multiple
curves in the same window. I can't do 
  plot ([x^(0.5*k) for k=-4..6],color=[blue, red, black, ...])

Have a nice day !

F.

There is some mis-understanding here. TeXmacs can display inline graphics 
for quite some time, and interfaces to many computer algebra systems do 
exactly this. TeXmacs can send commands to external programs. No need to 
wait, all of this is available. So, I think, TeXmacs is just a better 
hyperdoc than hyperdoc.

Well, of course, the *full* semantics of an expression only exists within 
Axiom. But a straightforward s-expression can easily contain more 
semantics than LaTeX of display mathml. What is "a(b+c)", for example - a 
function with an argument or a product? These 2 cases should be typesetted 
slightly differently (and TeXmacs knows that).

I don't say that the current TeXmacs-Axiom interface is good, because it 
is not. Therefore, few people use it. On the other hand, the 
TeXmacs-maxima interface is much better, and the number of users is quite 
large (I know, because I get a lot of emails when a new version od maxima 
breaks this interface; this happens regularly :-( I think that a new and 
much better TeXmacs-Axiom interface can be produced by a fraction of 
efforts needed for other kinds of interfaces, which re-invent more weels. 
I started to do it some time ago (not recently, don't remember exactly 
when). I only needed a little help. I posted some questions to this list, 
and received 0 replies. Exactly 0. So I could not proceed :-(

An idea about graphics: why not use an existing powerful data 
visualisation system instead of the current graphics viewer? Something 
like ParaView, VisIt, or OpenDX. These systems are highly non-trivial, and 
it would be a shame to re-implement a small fraction of their 
functionality instead of just using them. And Axiom will just prepare data 
files for them. They are all free, and available on many platforms.

Could you re-post the questions?  It sounds like now might be a good
time to revisit those questions and see if we can get you some answers.

Cheers,

Alfredo, thanks for noticing this change. The content of the online
Sage Notebook was modified after I added the link. I have corrected
it now so that people can see immediately how Axiom looks in Sage:

Please see the examples at:

Feel free to modify it and create more examples and/or create new
notebook pages. But be aware that you are editing online, so other
people will see your changes.

I would be happy to answer any questions you have.

This is a good idea. I think in theory the best possible visualization 
system would need to be tied closely to the core system, but I certainly 
agree that the ability to take advantage of these systems is desirable 
both as a short term measure and as a longer term feature.  I suspect 
the primary difficulty comes from most of us not knowing how to get 
started implementing such export abilities.

I know of those programs, but I don't know much about them.  I have 
installed ParaView and OpenDX in the past, but I have not done much with 
them.  IIRC ParaView and VisIt both use the VTK toolkit.  I have heard 
very good things about that toolkit and have wondered in the past if it 
wouldn't be capable of some truly stunning 3D plotting, but the learning 
curve to working with it always seemed a bit formidable, to say nothing 
of linking it to Lisp.  Those systems seem a little heavyweight for 
simple plot display, but of course there are likely to be many other 
applications.

There are other formants which would be useful.  Gnuplot is an obvious 
one, and I think Grace would be a useful target as well for 2D output. 
There are others. Probably once one such interface is made more would be 
reasonably straightforward, at least as far as simple export is concerned.

Cheers,
CY
