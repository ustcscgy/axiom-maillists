Greetings!  Using GCL, you can expand the stacks at runtime using (setq
si::*multiply-stacks* n), where n is typically some small positive power
of 2.

Take care,

----------------------------------------------------------------

As computers and communications technology advance, greater
opportunities arise for intelligent mathematical computation. While
computer algebra, automated deduction, mathematical publishing and
novel user interfaces individually have long and successful histories,
we are now seeing increasing opportunities for synergy among these
areas. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics offers a
venue for discussing these areas and their synergy.

The conference will be organized by Serge Autexier and Michael
Kohlhase at Jacobs University in Bremen and consist of five tracks:

Artificial Intelligence and Symbolic Computation (AISC)

*** AISC ***

Symbolic computation can be roughly described as the study of
algorithms which operate on expression trees. Another way to phrase
this is to say that the denotational semantics of expressions trees is
not fixed, but is rather context dependent. Expression simplification
is probably the archetypal symbolic computation. Mathematically
oriented software (such as the so-called computer algebra systems)
have been doing this for decades, but not long thereafter, systems
doing proof planning and theorem discovery also started doing the
same; some attempts at knowledge management and 'expert systems' were
also symbolic, but less successfully so. More recently, many different
kinds of program analyses have gotten `symbolic', as well as some of
the automated theorem proving (SMT, CAV, etc).

But a large number of the underlying problems solved by symbolic
techniques are well known to be undecidable (never mind the many that
are EXP-time complete, etc). Artificial Intelligence has been
attacking many of these different sub-problems for quite some time,
and has also built up a solid body of knowledge. In fact, most
symbolic computation systems grew out of AI projects.

These two fields definitely intersect. One could say that in the
intersection lies all those problems for which we have no decision
procedures. In other words, decision procedures mark a definite phase
shift in our understanding, but are not always possible. Yet we still
want to solve certain problems, and must find 'other' means of
(partial) solution. This is the fertile land which comprises the core
of AISC.

Rather than try to exhaustively list topics of interest, it is
simplest to say that AISC seeks work which advances the understanding
of

Solving problems which fundamentally involve the manipulation of
expressions, but for which decision procedures are unlikely to ever
exist.


*** Calculemus ***

Calculemus is a series of conferences dedicated to the integration of
computer algebra systems (CAS) and systems for mechanised reasoning,
the interactive theorem provers or proof assistants (PA) and the
automated theorem provers (ATP). Currently, symbolic computation is
divided into several (more or less) independent branches: traditional
ones (e.g., computer algebra and mechanised reasoning) as well as
newly emerging ones (on user interfaces, knowledge management, theory
exploration, etc.) The main concern of the Calculemus community is to
bring these developments together in order to facilitate the theory,
design, and implementation of integrated systems for computer
mathematics that will routinely be used by mathematicians, computer
scientists and engineers in their every day business.

The topics of interest of Calculemus include but are not limited to:

	* Theorem proving in computer algebra (CAS)
	* Computer algebra in theorem proving (PA and ATP)
	* Case studies and applications that both involve computer
         	algebra and mechanised reasoning
	* Representation of mathematics in computer algebra
	* Adding computational capabilities to PA and ATP
	* Formal methods requiring mixed computing and proving
	* Combining methods of symbolic computation and formal
                 deduction
	* Mathematical computation in PA and ATP
	* Theory, design and implementation of interdisciplinary
        	systems for computer mathematics
	* Theory exploration techniques
	* Input languages, programming languages, types and constraint
    	        languages, and modeling languages for mechanised
    	        mathematics systems (PA, CAS, and ATP).
	* Infrastructure for mathematical services

*** DML ***

Mathematicians dream of a digital archive containing all peer-reviewed
mathematical literature ever published, properly linked, validated and
verified.  It is estimated that the entire corpus of mathematical
knowledge published over the centuries does not exceed 100,000,000
pages, an amount easily manageable by current information
technologies. Following success of DML 2008, DML 2009 DML 2010, and
DML 2011 track objectives are to formulate the strategy and goals of a
global mathematical digital library and to summarize the current
successes and failures of ongoing technologies and related projects as
EuDML, asking such questions as:

	* What technologies, standards, algorithms and formats should
		be used and what metadata should be shared?
	* What business models are suitable for publishers of
		mathematical literature, authors and funders of their
		projects and institutions?
	* Is there a model of sustainable, interoperable, and
		extensible mathematical library that mathematicians
		can use in their everyday work?
	* What is the best practice for
		* retrodigitized mathematics (from images via OCR to
                         MathML or TeX);
		* retro-born-digital mathematics (from existing
			electronic copy in DVI, PS or PDF to MathML or
			TeX);
		* born-digital mathematics (how to make needed
			metadata and file formats available as a side
			effect of publishing workflow [CEDRAM/Euclid
			model])?

DML is an opportunity to share experience and best practices between
projects in any area (MKM, NLP, OCR, pattern recognition, whatever)
that could change the paradigm for searching, accessing, and
interacting with the mathematical corpus. The track is
trans/interdisciplinary and contributions from any kind of people on
any aspect of the DML building are welcome.

*** MKM ***

Mathematical Knowledge Management is an interdisciplinary field of
research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, library
science, and scientific publishing. The objective of MKM is to develop
new and better ways of managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge,
based on innovative technology of computer science, the Internet, and
intelligent knowledge processing. MKM is expected to serve
mathematicians, scientists, and engineers who produce and use
mathematical knowledge; educators and students who teach and learn
mathematics; publishers who offer mathematical textbooks and
disseminate new mathematical results; and librarians and
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.

The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge
management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:

	* Representations of mathematical knowledge
	* Authoring languages and tools
	* Repositories of formalized mathematics
	* Deduction systems
	* Mathematical digital libraries
	* Diagrammatic representations
	* Mathematical OCR
	* Mathematical search and retrieval
	* Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems
	* MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards
	* Web presentation of mathematics
	* Data mining, discovery, theory exploration
	* Computer algebra systems
	* Collaboration tools for mathematics
	* Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows
=09
*** Systems and Projects ***

The Systems and Projects track of the Conferences on Intelligent
Computer Mathematics is a forum for presentation of systems and new
and ongoing projects in all areas and topics related to the CICM
conferences:

	* AI and Symbolic Computation
	* Deduction and Computer Algebra
	* Mathematical Knowledge Management
	* Digital Mathematical Libraries

The track aims to provide an overview of the latest developments and
trends within the CICM community as well as to exchange ideas between
developers and introduce systems to an audience of potential users.

We solicit submissions for two page abstracts in the categories of
system descriptions and project presentations. System description
should present

	* newly developed systems,
	* systems that have not previously been presented to the CICM
                 community, or
	* significant updates to existing systems.

Project presentation should describe

	* projects that are new or about to start,
	* ongoing projects that have not yet been presented to the
                 CICM community.
	* significant new developments in ongoing previously presented
                 projects.

All submissions should contain links to demos, downloadable systems,
or project pages. Availability of such accompanying material will be a
strong prerequisite for acceptance.

Accepted abstracts will be published in the CICM proceedings in
Springer's LNAI series. Author's are expected to present their
abstracts in 5-10 minute teaser talks followed by an open demo/poster
session. System papers must be accompanied by a system demonstration,
while project papers must be accompanied by a poster presentation.

----------------------------------------------------------------
                              Submitting
----------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions to tracks A to D must not exceed 15 pages and will be
reviewed and evaluated with respect to relevance, clarity, quality,
originality, and impact.  Shorter papers, e.g., for system
descriptions, are welcome. Authors will have an opportunity to respond
to their papers' reviews before the programme committee makes a
decision.

Submissions to the Systems & Projects track must not exceed four
pages. The accepted abstracts will be presented at CICM in a fast
presentation session, followed by an open demo/poster session. System
papers must be accompanied by a system demonstration, and project
papers must be accompanied by a poster presentation. The four pages of
the abstract should be new material, accompanied by links to
demos/downloads/project-pages and [existing] system descriptions.
Availability of such accompanying material will be a strong
prerequisite for acceptance.

Accepted conference submissions from all tracks will be published as a
volume in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI)
by Springer. In addition to these formal proceedings, authors are
permitted and encouraged to publish the final versions of their papers
on arXiv.org.

Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the
presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for
submission as a full or system description paper. This includes work
in progress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we
recommend 5 - 10 pages.

The programme committee may offer authors of rejected formal
submissions to publish their contributions as work-in-progress papers
instead. Depending on the number of work-in-progress papers accepted,
they will be presented at the conference either as short talks or as
posters. The work-in-progress proceedings will be published as a
technical report.

All papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the
requirements of Springer's LNCS series (the corresponding style files
can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). By submitting a paper
the authors agree that if it is accepted at least one of the authors
will attend the conference to present it.

Electronic submission is done through easychair=20
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcicm2012).

DML is an opportunity to share experience and best practices between
projects in any area (MKM, NLP, OCR, pattern recognition, whatever)
that could change the paradigm for searching, accessing, and
interacting with the mathematical corpus. The track is
trans/interdisciplinary and contributions from any kind of people on
any aspect of the DML building are welcome.

*** MKM ***

Mathematical Knowledge Management is an interdisciplinary field of
research in the intersection of mathematics, computer science, library
science, and scientific publishing. The objective of MKM is to develop
new and better ways of managing sophisticated mathematical knowledge,
based on innovative technology of computer science, the Internet, and
intelligent knowledge processing. MKM is expected to serve
mathematicians, scientists, and engineers who produce and use
mathematical knowledge; educators and students who teach and learn
mathematics; publishers who offer mathematical textbooks and
disseminate new mathematical results; and librarians and
mathematicians who catalog and organize mathematical knowledge.

The conference is concerned with all aspects of mathematical knowledge
management. A non-exclusive list of important topics includes:

        * Representations of mathematical knowledge
        * Authoring languages and tools
        * Repositories of formalized mathematics
        * Deduction systems
        * Mathematical digital libraries
        * Diagrammatic representations
        * Mathematical OCR
        * Mathematical search and retrieval
        * Math assistants, tutoring and assessment systems
        * MathML, OpenMath, and other mathematical content standards
        * Web presentation of mathematics
        * Data mining, discovery, theory exploration
        * Computer algebra systems
        * Collaboration tools for mathematics
        * Challenges and solutions for mathematical workflows
       =20
*** Systems and Projects ***

The Systems and Projects track of the Conferences on Intelligent
Computer Mathematics is a forum for presentation of systems and new
and ongoing projects in all areas and topics related to the CICM
conferences:

        * AI and Symbolic Computation
        * Deduction and Computer Algebra
        * Mathematical Knowledge Management
        * Digital Mathematical Libraries

The track aims to provide an overview of the latest developments and
trends within the CICM community as well as to exchange ideas between
developers and introduce systems to an audience of potential users.

We solicit submissions for two page abstracts in the categories of
system descriptions and project presentations. System description
should present

        * newly developed systems,
        * systems that have not previously been presented to the CICM
                 community, or
        * significant updates to existing systems.

Project presentation should describe

        * projects that are new or about to start,
        * ongoing projects that have not yet been presented to the
                 CICM community.
        * significant new developments in ongoing previously presented
                 projects.

All submissions should contain links to demos, downloadable systems,
or project pages. Availability of such accompanying material will be a
strong prerequisite for acceptance.

Accepted abstracts will be published in the CICM proceedings in
Springer's LNAI series. Author's are expected to present their
abstracts in 5-10 minute teaser talks followed by an open demo/poster
session. System papers must be accompanied by a system demonstration,
while project papers must be accompanied by a poster presentation.

----------------------------------------------------------------
                              Submitting
----------------------------------------------------------------

Submissions to tracks A to D must not exceed 15 pages and will be
reviewed and evaluated with respect to relevance, clarity, quality,
originality, and impact.  Shorter papers, e.g., for system
descriptions, are welcome. Authors will have an opportunity to respond
to their papers' reviews before the programme committee makes a
decision.

Submissions to the Systems & Projects track must not exceed four
pages. The accepted abstracts will be presented at CICM in a fast
presentation session, followed by an open demo/poster session. System
papers must be accompanied by a system demonstration, and project
papers must be accompanied by a poster presentation. The four pages of
the abstract should be new material, accompanied by links to
demos/downloads/project-pages and [existing] system descriptions.
Availability of such accompanying material will be a strong
prerequisite for acceptance.

Accepted conference submissions from all tracks will be published as a
volume in the series Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI)
by Springer. In addition to these formal proceedings, authors are
permitted and encouraged to publish the final versions of their papers
on arXiv.org.

Work-in-progress submissions are intended to provide a forum for the
presentation of original work that is not (yet) in a suitable form for
submission as a full or system description paper. This includes work
in progress and emerging trends. Their size is not limited, but we
recommend 5 - 10 pages.

The programme committee may offer authors of rejected formal
submissions to publish their contributions as work-in-progress papers
instead. Depending on the number of work-in-progress papers accepted,
they will be presented at the conference either as short talks or as
posters. The work-in-progress proceedings will be published as a
technical report.

All papers should be prepared in LaTeX and formatted according to the
requirements of Springer's LNCS series (the corresponding style files
can be downloaded from
http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html). By submitting a paper
the authors agree that if it is accepted at least one of the authors
will attend the conference to present it.

Electronic submission is done through easychair=20
(http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=3Dcicm2012).

Publish the code and the data as well as the results.
People should be able to reproduce results without
contacting the original authors.

We really do need to raise the level of scholarship
in software and software-related science.

Scientists, Share Secrets or Lose Funding: Stodden and Arbesman
2012-01-10 00:00:13.0 GMT


     (For more Bloomberg View, click on VIEW <GO>.)

By Victoria Stodden and Samuel Arbesman
     Jan. 10 (Bloomberg) -- The Journal of Irreproducible
Results, a science-humor magazine, is, sadly, no longer the only
publication that can lay claim to its title. More and more
published scientific studies are difficult or impossible to
repeat.
     It=E2=80=99s not that the experiments themselves are so flawed they
can=E2=80=99t be redone to the same effect -- though this happens more
than scientists would like. It=E2=80=99s that the data upon which the
work is based, as well as the methods employed, are too often
not published, leaving the science hidden.
     Many people assume that scientists the world over freely
exchange not only the results of their experiments but also the
detailed data, statistical tools and computer instructions they
employed to arrive at those results. This is the kind of
information that other scientists need in order to replicate the
studies. The truth is, open exchange of such information is not
common, making verification of published findings all but
impossible and creating a credibility crisis in computational
science.
     Federal agencies that fund scientific research are in a
position to help fix this problem. They should require that all
scientists whose studies they finance share the files that
generated their published findings, the raw data and the
computer instructions that carried out their analysis.
     The ability to reproduce experiments is important not only
for the advancement of pure science but also to address many
science-based issues in the public sphere, from climate change
to biotechnology.

                    Too Little Transparency

     Consider, for example, a recent notorious incident in
biomedical science. In 2006, researchers at Duke University
seemed to have discovered relationships between lung cancer
patients=E2=80=99 personal genetic signatures and their responsiveness
to certain drugs. The scientists published their results in
respected journals (the New England Journal of Medicine and
Nature Medicine), but only part of the genetic signature data
used in the studies was publicly available, and the computer
codes used to generate the findings were never revealed. This is
unfortunately typical for scientific publications.
     The Duke research was considered such a breakthrough that
other scientists quickly became interested in replicating it,
but because so much information was unavailable, it took three
years for them to uncover and publicize a number of very serious
errors in the published reports. Eventually, those reports were
retracted, and clinical trials based on the flawed results were
canceled.
     In response to this incident, the Institute of Medicine
convened a committee to review what data should appropriately be
revealed from genomics research that leads to clinical trials.
This committee is due to release its report early this year.
     Unfortunately, the research community rarely addresses the
problem of reproducibility so directly. Inadequate sharing is
common to all scientific domains that use computers in their
research today (most of science), and it hampers transparency.
     By making the underlying data and computer code
conveniently available, scientists could open a new era of
innovation and growth. In October, the White House released a
memorandum titled =E2=80=9CAccelerating Technology Transfer and
Commercialization of Federal Research in Support of High-Growth
Businesses,=E2=80=9D which outlines ways for federal funding agencies to
improve the rate of technology transfer from government-financed
laboratories to the private business sector.

                      Technology Transfer

     In this memo, President Barack Obama called on federal
agencies to measure the rate of technology transfer. To this
end, agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the
National Science Foundation should require that scientists who
receive federal funds publish full results, including the data
they are based on and all the computer steps taken to reach
them. This could include providing links to Internet sites
containing the data and codes required to replicate the
published results.
     Exceptions could be made when necessary -- some information
might need to be kept confidential for national-security
reasons, for example. But standard practice for scientific
publication should be full transparency.
     Leaving this up to the scientific community isn=E2=80=99t
sufficient. Nor is relying on current federal rules. Grant
guidelines from the NIH and the NSF instruct researchers to
share with other investigators the data generated in the course
of their work, but this isn=E2=80=99t enforced. The NIH demands that
articles resulting from research it finances be made freely
available within a year of publication. But even if this policy
were extended to all government-financed studies, the data and
computer codes needed to verify the findings would still remain
inaccessible.
     As Jon Claerbout, a professor emeritus of geophysics at
Stanford University, has noted, scientific publication isn=E2=80=99t
scholarship itself, but only the advertising of scholarship. The
actual work -- the steps needed to reproduce the scientific
finding -- must be shared.
     Stricter requirements for transparency in publication would
allow scientific findings to more quickly become fuel for
innovation and help ensure that public policy is based on sound
science.

Suggested reading:

Computers in Science and Engineering (IEEE + APS):

vol.11 n.1 - most of the issue which is dedicated to the problem

vol.12 no.5 p.8--12 - A Yale round table on the subject

My impression is that many, if not most, labs would have trouble
reproducing their own results given propensities to modify code,
lack of archiving, wandering data sets, etc.

Then of course there is the instance of a group whose idea
of collaboration was to send a another researcher their raw data;
they sent her a four-inch thick fanfold binder of printout.

Does the code have to be physically in the same document as the documentation 
to achieve the aims of literate programming?

The analogy that I would make is with graphics in html, these are stored in 
their own files so we can edit a .gif file or a .jpeg file or .png or .svg and 
so on each with there own appropriate graphics editor. The browser brings 
these all together, when its being read,  so that the end user can read the 
"story".

Is there some way this could be done for code? That is get the browser to 
insert it into the document when its being read rather than build what looks 
like quite messy tangling and untangling tools?

It all depends on your tools. If there were a tool that puts every code 
chunk into a separate file but while editing shows you the chunks in the 
order you want, you wouldn't care how your content is physically stored.

A tool that can show (maybe even different) views on code and 
documentation would certainly be optimal. Anyway, I think one of the 
important view is that a potential reader can understand the code and 
the ideas (theory) that the code builds on. So the "literate programmer" 
also has the task to linearize thoughts and help others to understand 
the program.

Different views on the program is another helpful feature, but without 
also restructuring the accompanying documentation, it would not belong 
to the world of LP.

LP doesn't say how things have to be stored. In only says that you 
embellish your documentation with nice constructive examples (the actual 
code).
(Traditionally, we embellish programs by documentation.)

The example I gave was
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/litprog.html
which was a literate program in HTML.

It only depends on the ability to find <pre> tags which
contain an id= field as in <pre id="chunkname">

If you have control of the server it would be possible to
use PHP to construct your documentation "on the fly" by
including source chunks and sending them to the final page.
You could put id fields on <a> tags and parse the href field.

Latex does allow you to \include files but that would be
missing the point. Latex can also re-render in html.

Unfortunately it feels like you are trying to maintain the
idea that source code should live in little files. This has
a very long history but is actually a very bad idea. We are
forced to create tools to handle this (e.g. IDEs) so we can
manipulate the program "as a whole". You want to go from the
little files to the big document. Literate programs are
generally structured to work from big to little.

Literate programs change the structure of files in very
fundamental ways. The first priority of a literate program
is to communicate to another human. The code is expanded
in the document when it is properly motivated. Thus you 
find that the contents of a header file is usually spread
around in a literate document and re-assembled for the
compiler.

There is a book called 
"Implementing Elliptic Curve Cryptography" by Mike Rosing
which is my new favorite literate program.

To really see the difference literate programming can make
you can download Rosing's program and you can read the book.
The program is standard C and contains lines like

   #define NUMBITS 158

Do you know why NUMBITS is 158? I doubt that you can 
reverse-engineer the answer from his code. But the book
makes the answer obvious.

Further, elliptic curve cryptography depends on things
like modular polynomial arithmetic which might be rather
hard for your average C programmer to reverse-engineer.
The book explains the theory.

I am trying to set up a study at some university that would
use Rosing's book and programs. I want to give one group a
copy of the book and the other group just the C programs.
Then I want to evaluate the comprehension of the two groups.

It is my conjecture that the book group would have a deeper
understanding of the program than the C group. I believe the
study will show this but until the study is done it is just
my opinion.

If anyone is at a university and knows of a professor who
might find such a study worthwhile, please let me know.
It is studies like this that make history in computer 
science, just like the studies of programmer productivity.
A properly done study would be a landmark paper.

Its just that the method Tim describes for embedding code into html here:
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/litprog.html
has some complications and requires specialised tools.

In some ways I find the current LP and hyperdoc stuff in Axiom flavors 
actually makes it harder for me to produce the quality of documentation that I 
would like, although moving to an html version like this would help, I still 
think custom tools like this are a major problem.

I think it would be much better to use standard tools. I'm not sure that file 
structure is the most important issue? This seems like a technical issue to 
me. In the end the important issues to me are:

* Can I use standard tools that I already know to edit code, html and diagrams 
in WYSIWYG mode.
* Does it require maintainence of specialised tools?
* Does it inhibit development of IDE capablitied like code completion and 
debugging tools?
* Does it make documentation harder to produce rather than easier?
* Is there duplication between LP, Hyperdoc, )show, etc.

I think there is a lot to be said for keeping the documentation (LP and 
hyperdoc) on a server somwhere and only downloading code to users client.

Custom tools? The litprog.html describes a short C program that is the
only tool you need to do literate programming in HTML. And I've (almost
completely) rewritten Axiom to use standard latex everywhere so the
pamphlet files are straight latex using \begin{chunk}. The only tool
needed is a small tangle program which I have as a C utility and is
also compiled into the lisp image.

A single extraction tool does not seem to be much overhead.

Think of a calculus textbook. You want to keep the textbook on the 
server and only download the equations. That means that the user
will have a directory of equations without meaning living on the
local machine. I do not see the value of only downloading equations.

There is a language called Clojure. I have created a literate form
http://daly.axiom-developer.org/clojure.pamphlet
http://daly.axiom-developer.org/clojure.pdf

All of the information is in the pdf (and src) but basically you
extract a tangle program
http://daly.axiom-developer.org/tangle.c

If you do
   gcc -o tangle tangle.c
   tangle clojure.pamphlet Makefile >Makefile
   make

the makefile will extract the source code (mostly java) into the
correct tree, compile the code, run the test cases, rebuild the
pdf, and drop you into a running Clojure REPL.

If you modify the src pamphlet all you need to type is
    make clean
    make
and you now have a completely rebuilt, re-PDF'd, re-tested
Clojure with a running REPL. To modify the program and test
your new changes, just rinse and repeat.
 
How hard is this? It could hardly be easier. Send the single
pamphlet file to another user and they have everything.

Tim

Tim,

Perhaps I'm too set in my ways or perhaps I'm missing something but I think we 
are going to have to agree to disagree on this issue.

I think we agree on the importance of documentation and the importance of 
explaining the reasons behind things and the aims of LP.

But I think we will have to agree to disagree on the mechanics and that there 
should only be one linear path through the documentation.

Perhaps my thinking comes from liking to understand things in terms of 
pictures and diagrams rather than big chunks of text (I suspect I differ from 
most people in the pan-Axiom community in this respect). So, what I'm looking 
for is documentation rich with pictures, diagrams, tables, lists, animations, 
hyperdoc-like capability, different layouts and so on. Not the equivalent of a 
very big book.

In order to do this I think the documentation has to be based on html + png + 
svg and so on. This is very different to existing pamphlet files, as far as I 
can see the Clojure example you give is not HTML?

I can't see that it would be very desirable to just put HTML tags into a mega 
pamphlet file and sort out the technical issues you mention in your document. 
For one thing, one does not want to edit low level HTML using a simple text 
editor, I think it really needs WYSIWYG html and graphics editors. Also the 
whole idea of hypertext seems to favour a more hierarchical approach rather 
than a linear document.

I want to be able to start with a quick introduction to the program and when I 
get to something I'm specially interested to click on a hyperlink and drill 
down to more detail. The navigation should give many ways to read the document 
including LP-like and Hyperdoc-like and )show-like (computer generated 
reference information) all richly interlinked.

We have discussed these things before and I think I'm starting to repeat 
myself so, as I say I think it best to agree to disagree. I will watch your 
experiment with interest and be ready to be proved wrong.

Martin

Literate programming is a change of mindset. You clearly get it.
There is no "right" way to do it. And I don't feel we are disagreeing.

Absolutely. And I think you are doing an excellent job.

Well I read a LOT and I find that non-linear paths leave me with the
feeling that I'm missing something important. I don't have a way to
mark my path so I know what other paths to follow.

Yes, I'm using Latex for most of my work except for Volume 11
which is the new Axiom browser-based help system. I am experimenting
with using <canvas> tags as we speak. See
http://axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/axiomgraph
so I do find HTML5 interesting. 

I have included png and diagrams (see the Clojure pamphlet). 
I have seen 3D animations in PDF files which is a technology
I have bookmarked but not yet tried to use.

In fact, I do write all of my HTML by hand. I don't use WYSIWYG tools
at all. And the way I use hypertex is the same way I use latex, that 
is to say, I use #name tags into the same document to do things like
jump between sections. This allows the user to jump around in a
linear discussion.

The navigation is fine. What I find hard about hyperlinked documents
is that I quickly feel lost. Instead of moving from chapter to chapter
it feels like I'm reading random websites with random browser 
crashes. When I "put the website down" like I would with a book
I don't know how to start again.

You've done a good job at overall organization of your site by
keeping the tree structure at the top. However, when I re-visit
your site I don't know what I've seen and what I haven't.

I don't think you're wrong. I just think we have found our own
approach comfortable. As an old man with a large library I find
reading books to be a useful paradigm. You find the web to be a
useful paradigm. Either approach is fine.

Much more important is the literate programming mindset and
you clearly know that already. Keep up the good work.

I have been asked to do a video for the Clojure programming 
group about literate programming and this was a recent reply 
explaining the idea. I don't think I've mentioned this special
property of literate programming before but I think it is one
key reason to develop the practice.

I am composing the notes for this video and I realized I have
a piece of programming information about myself that you probably
do not have about yourself.

Years ago I wrote a program (Archive) to allow users of a time
shared mainframe to back up programs to magnetic tape. This was
a single person project. As an experiment I copied every input
at the keyboard and every output of every command. I also kept
a journal of everything I did, why I did it, and what failed.

The key result was that I discovered what I call my personal
"irreducible error rate". If I do 100 things I will make 3 errors.
This was independent of the task. So typing 100 characters has
3 wrong letters which were mostly caught while typing. Writing
100 lines of code had 3 errors somewhere. Composing email
introduces 3 errors per 100 lines of code.

Most of the errors were trivial (spelling), some were syntax
(missing delimiter), some were semantic (wrong action), some
were design (wrong solution). 

As a result of this measurement I have formed habits to look
for the 3 mistakes I know exist. For example, I am writing a
book of Axiom graphics images (a "gallery"). I have written
679 equations so far, which are going to create the images.

I know there are at least 21 uncaught errors lurking in those
equations. So before I attempt to generate the images I will
examine them in detail with an eye toward finding what I know
is there.

Literate programming is both a source of errors and a help.

It is a source of errors because I have more typing to do
and will generate bad latex and meaningless sentences, as 
well as the "standard" coding errors. So in some sense I have
added to the number of errors I WILL introduce. But the tools,
like the compiler, tex and spellcheck will at least warn me of
these failures.

However, literate programming helps because I am explaining
what I am doing to myself as well as others. This really 
reduces the "big", "costly" errors, those in the design and
implementation. There are no tools to help so I have to create
a discipline that will highlight these errors as soon as
possible.

I KNOW my intrinsic error rate. What is yours? 

What discipline can you apply to your work to find your errors?

I'm not sure how to get this important piece of self-knowledge
into the video so I thought I'm mention it here.

Tim Daly
