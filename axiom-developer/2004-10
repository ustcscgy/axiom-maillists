Wow, from what I have seen in Norman Ramsey's l2h code, that
sounds like a lot of work to do "from the ground-up", so as
to speak. BTW, if you read the l2h code, you will notice
that it does not use any regular expression pattern matching
stuff at all, but a rather different and seemingly robust,
mostly declarative parsing method that I hadn't seen before
called "continuations" - a little like co routines but different.
The syntax and semantics of Icon is very high level - not so
different from Python, so in principle a conversion of l2h
to Python might not be out of the question. In any case,
before embarking on "true" latex, I think it would be worth
looking at Ramsey's l2h documentation. See

I am not so sure how possible it might be to use Ramsey's
approach in the StructuredText framework - not such a good
match I think. One of my goals here is *code re-use* and
to avoid writing much new code except that needed as "glue".

For me, such re-used has only really begun to seem possible
and practical in the new world of supercomputer desktops.
I used to think badly of, and label as a "hack", the sometimes
inefficient and often conceptually muddled software that
results from such "cross-breeding", but the technology has
definitely changed since the last time I did this kind of
work...

I would like to discuss this further, but I find synchronous

Thanks. I *will* look at this but I can not promise that it

Yes. Specifically MathAction is what I call the stand-alone
LatexWiki-based website at

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction

As you know, there is also the Axiom Portal web site that is
Plone-based and supports LatexWiki objects.

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/plone

I really don't want to get into maintaining a piece of
software. I would much prefer to leave that to other people
(such as yourself). But as seems common among "open source
types", I am a bit of a maverick when it comes to using
(and re-using) software, so I can't guarantee that I will
always be working in a structured mode that will be easy
to merge. As usual, our ambitions still far out strip
our resources and time constraints...

Bill Page.

That is *exactly* who the pamphlet support in MathAction will
work. You will be able to try it very soon now, once I tweak
l2h just a little more to avoid a problem in the way it creates
cross-references in an HTML+LaTeX file which sometimes messes
up the LatexWiki processing. Running it "in background" is
straight-forward.

That is of course already a problem when writing Axiom and
Reduce code that might fail for a variety of reasons. In fact
it is also true for simple LaTeX coding errors and sometimes
even unexpected results from "structured text" mode.

YES! I would like this sort extension of LatexWiki very much.
It would also help solve the problem of "junk email" being
sent to wiki subscribers while just trying to get "something
stupid", right. I like to run the MathAction wiki with the
subscription options set to send all edits and not just the
new page stuff. But this can sometimes get tedious. If a
user could click a Draft or Preview button instead of the
Save button, then editing cycle could be (Edit, Preview)*,
Save with only the final Save resulting in sending the
diffs to the subscribers. A few weeks ago I did look at
the possibility of adding this but I realized that it would
really have to be an extension of ZWiki, not LatexWiki,
and I did not know enough about ZWiki to even attempt it.

I think that this will be quite easy to implement. The
only step that I see missing in what I am doing right now
would be some means to directly integrate the wiki pages
containing the pamphlet code into the notangle processing
in the build makefile. Wiki pages are Zope objects that are
not directly accessible to the file system.

Personally, I think that Zope's history mechanism would be
sufficient for most purposes (I don't know how many times
the Zope Undo has saved me from loosing important work)
although, granted it is not darcs, arch or even CVS. However
I think there are some Zope products available that do this
sort of integration with CVS and arch. I don't know how well
or even if this would work with ZWiki / LatexWiki / MathAction.

That is yet another way to go, but have you ever tried
running ZWiki this way? I suspect that ZWiki might be rather
tightly integrated with the Zope object model so that this
is not straight forward. For example a wiki page actually
contains at least two representations of each page, the
'source' and the rendered 'presentation' form. Which of
these would be stored in the file system. Both?

But there might well be some advantages to this on a large
shared web site. Zope is notoriously slow at serving web
pages (not surprizing considering all that it does). Storing
the rendered pages on the file system would allow greater
use direct use of the Apache front-end server instead of
depending on http proxy. Already I do this kind of optimization
for serving the image files from LatexWiki which are stored
in the file system and not as Zope objects.

Bill Page.

I am also very interested in this discussion and also
believe that the ++ -- style comments and distinction
between them should go away.

Yes. That is exactly how the MathAction web site works
now with wiki pages containing compiled Axiom library code.
The TouchGraph navigator using the output of the compiler
to display the dependency graph of the Axiom categories,
domains and packages (which is not actually a hierarchy,
BTW).

Yes, this (and a lot more) will be directly available to
programmers when they navigate the hyperlinked MathAction
wiki pages containing the Axiom pamphlet files.

I don't see much point of giving documentation to the
compiler. Perhaps like the built-in Axiom compiler,
Aldor can be made to produce output which could be
interpreted as hyperlinks into the appropriate documentation?

Although this is technically possible, I think that it is
likely to fail for the same reasons that Tim gives below
for the failure of the -- ++ comment mechanism - something
that is not an integral part of the development process is
very likely to be ignored by (most) developers.

Yes, I think that this is very desirable *but* I think
that it is necessary to make the documentation more
directly usable than is the pamphlet file right now. Writing
LaTeX and thinking noweb/pamphlet organization for the code
is a complex skill that has to be learned. As a result it
is often left as an "after the fact" step in the creation
and publication of new ideas. I think we need to get useful
tools more "up front". This is fairly natural when using
computer algebra in mathematics and physics. Both Maple and
Mathematica have fairly "evolved" worksheet style user
interfaces that aid in the process, but they are missing
a more directly link to publishing.

I am mildly optimistic that the MathAction approach can
do all of this. :)

Yes, that is exactly what the MathAction interface to Axiom
will provide. See for example

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/dhmatrix

The hyperlink category and domain references are shown below the
Axiom code shown in green. For a graphical view of the links
click on the 'navigator' option at the top right of the page. See

    http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/TouchGraph

for more information about how to use the graphical navigator.

The layout and contents of this page is very close to what a user
will see for each pamphlet file in the system although right now
this page was generated in part manually rather than automatically
the way it soon will be when the user clicks Save after editing.
There will also be internal hyperlinks and an index for code chunks
like you see here

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/l2h

but I have a small problem right now with generating this links
when the page contains LaTeX codeing.

At this time I am still uncertain as to whether to include the
nontangle+Axiom output in the same page as the documentation,
as shown on the current dhmatrix page above, or whether to
present this in a separate page.

Regards,
Bill Page.

That is exactly what I meant. Tim Daly said that using Aldor for compiling
Axiom files (i.e., .as files that contain Aldor code but rely on the Axiom
library) should work, but either I'm missing the obvious or it is not obvious
how to do it...

I think this should be first priority for those who can resurrect this.

For lisp and especially compiler gurus -- Camm, I believe that's you... :-) --
a great (non-priority) project might be to make a (simple! non-optimizing) lisp
implementation of the Aldor compiler that could be freely distributed and run
within axiom.

One good reason for that is the following: a bug can have different
origins. Sometimes it is obvious, that it is an algebra bug, or a compiler bug,
or a lisp bug, but sometimes this is not clear at all.

Having different, but semantically -- modulo bugs -- equivalent implementations
would ease debugging quite a bit, I imagine.

On the other hand, given our limited resources, this seems quite out of
reach...

I think that both ++ and -- *could* serve one purpose as follows:

as a said before, -- comments often contain old code. I think it is not wise to
ban this code into the archives too early, since it often explains why the new
code looks as it looks like. Clearly, such -- comments need to be rendered just
as the rest of the code, it might be nice if they were a little "lighter".

++ comments currently contain a *short* explanation of what the function
does. Appendix E of Jenks Sutor (which is missing from the electronic version)
seems to be a compilation of this. 

I am absolutely certain that this kind of documentation will be necessary in
future to. )show Integer does not suffice, since it contains only the
modelines. For example:

prefixRagits :
   [1] RadixExpansion D2 -> List Integer from RadixExpansion D2 if D2: 
            INT

      ++ prefixRagits(rx) returns the non-cyclic part of the ragits
      ++ of the fractional part of a radix expansion.
      ++ For example, if \spad{x = 3/28 = 0.10 714285 714285 ...},
      ++ then \spad{prefixRagits(x)=[1,0]}.

In some way or the other, we will need such short "abstracts" of each
function. Many of them are present currently, their style is very close to
StructuredText, so I'd suggest to use them! And yes, even to compile them
in. It will be a lot easier to extract them from a database then to extract
them from the pamphlet files.

If you propose to have some other command in the pamphlet file that creates
such a database, be it.

I think that {testcase}, \testinput and \testresult will be useful and will be
used. I wouldn't bother about the rest.

I vote for a separate page. However, there seems to be quite a bit missing from
the pamphlet file. I copy it here so you can verify. (note: directly copied
from the dvi file, so some characters are wrong.) The dvi output ends with:

Dear William,

this post adresses only the simple issue at the end of your mail. I'll have to
think a few minutes about the more complicated issues before...

That was not my intention. (By the way, please replace "able" by "so kind".
sorry)

Exactly. So what I meant: write a short summary of your proposal, and modify
the page like

Proposal 1:

  ...

Proposal 2:

  ...

That's only correct if you want to use it via email. I wouldn't suggest
that. What you can do is: press edit, copy the whole content of the page into
your favorite text editor, modify it, paste it back.

BEWARE!

Yes.

Well, I'd say, those who followed the thread a long time ago and want to make
up their mind what was their conclusion. I.e., no more than 20 lines.

You can (and should) use LaTeX (where appropriate)!

Don't worry about line breaks.

Here are the essentials, mostly from the help page (5th button on the top left
of every mathaction page)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Formatting rules in a nutshell

When you save a page, Zwiki normally applies standard ZWiki:TextFormattingRules
- most often ZWiki:StructuredText, which is described here; wiki linking rules;
and some additional formatting for comments.

paragraphs: non-blank lines are run together to form a paragraph; paragraphs
            are separated by blank lines (PLEASE: keep your lines shorter than
            80 chars in your source. That makes the diff's a lot easier to
            read.)
 
headings: a one-line "paragraph" followed by a more-indented paragraph makes a
          heading. Tip: you need only indent the first line.
 
lists: a paragraph beginning with - or a number followed by a space makes a
       bullet or numbered list item; a more-indented list item starts a
       sub-list
 
links: [ProgrammingAxiom]
       "programming":ProgrammingAxiom
       "hacking":http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/ProgrammingAxiom
 
code: short text enclosed in single quotes is quoted, i.e. displayed in
      monospace font and protected from some of the above formatting. For
      reliable quoting of a body of text, indent it after a paragraph ending
      with a double colon ::

       Like this (edit this page to see source).  This is the surest way to
       prevent WikiLinks, <HTML tags> and &dtml-tags; and preserve fixed-width
       formatting.

 
don't bother trying to learn all the text formatting rules and their
interactions. Mimic the text around you; when it does something unexpected,
tweak it until it looks right; go to the docs or ask for help when you get
really stuck or curious.


 > The text file would have to include Axiom code fragments as examples. I don't

\begin{axiom}
1+1
\end{axiom\

It's a pleasure. And I'd like to thank you for your patience, too!

Dear all,

as you may have noticed, 

exquo(simplify((A-2^a)*(A+2^a))::UP(A,EXPR INT),(A-2^a)::UP(A,EXPR INT))

currently fails. The reason is that Axiom does not know that

simplify((2^a)^2-2^(2*a))

vanishes.

Of course, that problem is unsolvable in general. However, I'm quite sure that
the current way deals with the problem (it ignores it) is that good.

I see the following possibility:

Every domain (that has a zero element) should know whether it can determine
whether one of its members is zero or not.

If it cannot, it should implement heuristics, but emit a warning.

Opinions?

Martin

I am not sure what you mean by "ban this code into the
archives". If one is working in a system like Zope that
retains a history, then nothing is banned. All you need
to do is take a look at the "diffs". For example look at

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/dhmatrix

Then click on 'diff' on the top right-hand side of the
page. You can click on 'previous edit' to see the entire
history of the contents of this page.

That said, you are right that some code highlight might
(if artfully done) might make Axiom code a little easier
to read. Shading in-line comments is one such simple thing.
Other examples are variable names in bold and/or maybe
different color depending on type etc. It is possible but
would require more syntax analysis - probably almost as
much work as the compilation itself. It is technically
possible but probably not really worth the effort.

But I think you are missing the point of Tim Daly's remarks.
Really, what is desired is that Axiom developers (and Knuth
and the 'literate programming movement' would claim that
programmers in general should do this) consider that what
they should be doing is creating a document, like writing a
scientific paper - one that is first of all intended to be
read and understood by other people (or oneself many years
later). The content of this document will also include
programming code, or in Axiom's case Axiom commands, which
is intended to be processed by the system in order to provide
proofs and/or demonstrations of mathematical concepts or to
extend the system in some way (e.g. define new categories
and domains).

>From this point of view, 'commented out' old programming
code is no different than other text in the document. The
point of that text would be to describe the development
of the content of document itself, for example like a diary
or 'blog'. But usually it is better to let the system track
this instead of letting it 'clutter up' the document itself.

Yes, of course. They become part of the literate document that
we are creating. Part of that document can be extracted and
organized automatically as needed.

No. This does not make sense. What you call 'pamphlet files'
are in fact already stored in a database - the Zope database.
That is what allows them to be manipulated in more complex
ways than just plain text files.

No, it becomes part of the function of the online system
like on MathAction.

Ok. Yes, the more I think about this, I agree. It should be
a separate but hyperlinked page.

I don't understand from what you include below what you
think is "missing". You said: "missing from the pamphlet
file" but everything is generated from the file. Can you
give me an explicit example of something?

new() ->%A
new() ->%B
new() ->%C
resetNew()
new() ->%A
new() ->%B
new() ->%C

before the patch

new() ->%A
new() ->%B
new() ->%C
resetNew()
new() ->%D
new() ->%E
new() ->%F

after.  As we inspect the package for pre-existing symbols in
selecting the index for new, we need to wipe out those symbols on
resetNew().

Thanks for the list!  The one that leaps out to me is the
hypergeometric series.  Is there no such support in axiom so far?  In
all honesty, I have not yet acquired sufficient experience using
axiom, as I'm too busy supporting its build infrastructure, along with
that of acl2 and maxima.  I feel I could comment more meaningfully
after spending some time trying to apply axiom to real problems.

The windows port is an obvious low hanging fruit which I'm happy to
help with.  Unfortunately, I have no such machine, nor access to one.
Perhaps someone who has such a box on a fast network connection could
enable ssh access.  Tools needed would be msys, mingw, gdb, emacs, and
a shell.  I'm hoping the graphics will stay out of the way.  Our GCL
windows expert has done this for a time, but it was his home machine
and was understandably quite inconvenient.

Feyncalc.  Actually this one might go at the top.

Another thing I receive requests for are graphics and the hyperdoc
documentation facility.

There is a lot of work to do with GCL too, so at most one of these
might get a small fraction of my spare cpu cycles, alas.

Take care,

I have put this into the file ff.as started axiom and then the following

(1) -> )compile ff
    Compiling AXIOM source code from file /home/hemmecke/ff.as using
       AXIOM-XL compiler and options

    Compiling Lisp source code from file ./ff.lsp
    Issuing )library command for ff
    Reading ff.asy
(1) -> fact 4

    (1)  24

So what is the problem?

Well, this was not OpenAxiom, but the NAG version. So at least this 
should be the way to use the aldor compiler.

But, under OpenAxiom, I cannot do this.

(1) -> )compile ff
    Compiling AXIOM source code from file
       /z_mnt/kludge/zlocal/md8/hemmecke/ff.as using AXIOM-XL compiler

protected-symbol-warn called with (NIL)

I have AXIOM=/zvol/axiom/axiom/mnt/linux and a compiler directory in 
there is missing. So I said

ln -s /zvol/aldor/Linux $AXIOM/compiler

where /zvol/aldor/Linux is the root of my aldor installation.

I've found libaxiom.al in the CVS directory so...

ln -s /zvol/axiom/cvs/axiom/src/share/algebra/libaxiom.al \
    $AXIOM/compiler/lib

And I've put the file axiom.as

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-mail/2004-09/msg00033.html

into $AXIOM/compiler/include.


Then I started Axiom and...

This is a bug in the glibc maintainer's 'shlibs' file.  If you would
like, I'd recommend filing a bug with this package via reportbug.

The autobuild for the alpha binary is atL

http://buildd.debian.org/fetch.php?&pkg=axiom&ver=0.20040831-1&arch=alpha&stamp=1094075004&file=log&as=raw

The toolchain versions used were:

Toolchain package versions: libc6.1-dev_2.3.2.ds1-16 linux-kernel-headers_2.5.999-test7-bk-17 gcc-3.3_1:3.3.4-9 g++-3.3_1:3.3.4-9 binutils_2.15-2 libstdc++5_1:3.3.4-9 libstdc++5-3.3-dev_1:3.3.4-9

Yet the (calculated from 'shlibs' files) dependencies were:

Depends: libc6.1 (>= 2.3.2.ds1-4), libgmp3, libncurses5 (>= 5.4-1), libreadline4 (>= 4.3-1), axiom-databases (= 0.20040831-1)

Please note also that now that -16 is in testing, the issue will not
bite anyone doing an apt-get upgrade.

My suspicion here is in the python lib calling axiom.  If one can
reproduce an error with the intel axiom standalone, I'd be most
appreciative!

My suspicion lies in python's pipe code, possibly in conjunction with
GCL readline.  Can a segault be reproduced with axiom intel
standalone?  Alternatively, can someone please try to reproduce
setting the TERM environment variable to "dumb"?  Might need to check
strace -f on the process to make sure Python does not setup the pipe
environment as a readline capable terminal (e.g. vt100).  If one can
get to axiom at all over the pipe, try doing )lisp (si::readline-off)
at the beginning, or putting this into some axiom rc startup file or
something. 

Please feel free to report all Debian binary bugs to the Debian BTS
via 'reportbug'.

Hans,

When you can find some "spare" time, would it be possible for
you to attempt what Camm describes below?

Camm,

I suppose that "setting TERM environment variable to dumb"
must disable GCL's use of readline? If so, since we definitely
don't want readline functionality when AXIOMsys is called
from the MathAction wiki, I can easily set this environment
variable when AXIOMsys is called.

Thanks!

Bill Page.

Yes, readline is automatically disabled if 1) standard input is not a
terminal (via isatty()) or 2) TERM is unset or 3) TERM is "dumb"
(e.g. emacs shell buffer).

Please let me know if problems persist.

Take care,

???? I still don't understand. I see all of the code that
you show as output from dvi and more! In your dvi output
for dhmatrix, the routines are shown just as

<rotatex>
<rotatey>
<rotatez>
<scale>
<translate>

which is normal for the noweave output generated from
the dhmatrix.spad.pamphlet file. The mathaction wiki page
on MathAction shows these chunks as expanded to the actual
code and compiled. That is what I meant about whether I
should included the compiled output on the same page or
separately. If it is separately, then the (for example)

  dhmatrix_pamphlet

page would look eactly like (and have essentially the same
internal navigation as) the dvi output. It will be rendered
by the command 'noweave -html -index -filter l2h' command.

There would be a separate page called just 'dhmatrix' that
contains the compiler output (that part shown in green
shading) obtained by applying notangle and AXIOMsys to the
same underlying source code as the 'dhmatrix_pamphlet'.

** Or **

Perhaps this is a way to have only one wiki page say
called just 'dhmatrix' that renders by default via notangle
AXIOMsys and LatexWiki but then an new method called
maybe 'weave' that would be called like this:

  dhmatrix/weave

which would access the noweave rendering.

Bob McElrath: Can you think of some (simple?) way of
achieving both of these renderings with one source file?

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Ok, I think I understand how to do this. I would turn it
around. 'dhmatrix' would be the only ZWiki page object
and it should have the default rendering of

 LatexWiki+HTML+(Axiom|Reduce ...)+weave

So when you Edit the wiki page 'dhmatrix' you see
pamphlet source code. When you click Save, it is
automatically rendered via the process

  noweave->(Axiom ..)->LatexWiki

Then there will be a *method* called 'tangle' which
could be applied for any LatexWiki page. A url like
this:

  http://.../zope/mathaction/dhmatrix/tangle/axiom

would have the effect of calling notangle to extract and
expand the default chunk <<*>>= from the 'dhmatrix' source
and call axiom via a /begin{axiom} ... /end{axiom} wrapper
and the render the result via LatexWiki. The rendered
result would be saved with the 'dhmatrix' object so that
this is only done once after the source object is edited,
(i.e. there would be two page renderings). In fact this
could be easily extended to

  http://.../zope/mathaction/dhmatrix/tangle/axiom/root

to allow starting the extraction and expansion with
the chunk named <<root>>= And so then there might be
even more than two renderings.

Note: The Axiom compiler output from .../tangle/axiom
would include category, domain and package hyperlink
references to wiki pages based on the Axiom abbreviations
of the Axiom modules on which it depends. If we arrange
the naming of pamphlet wiki pages properly, this would
mean that these cross-references would link directly by
default to the associated Axiom documentation.

What do you'all think?

Regards,
Bill Page.

This has been the single most frustrating thing in using axiom for
actual physics for me.  )show and friends give only interfaces, and if
you want to know what something does that's much more difficult.

I very much want to move away from Maple, but the intellectual cost of
learning a system this complex is high, so documentation should always
be readily available.

Further,

This idea is entirely general since for example in
a bash shell script or Makefile I could write

  wget http://.../pamphlet-file/tangle/code/hello |
    gcc -o hello.exe

to extract the code chunk named 'hello' from the
pamphlet named 'pamphlet-file' and pipe the source
code to the C compiler to produce an executable. Etc.

I think that's nice.

Bill Page.

I think you answered your own question.  ;)

Just one quibble.  Given a page::

    http://.../zope/mathaction/dhmatrix

you can then access python methods defined by that zope object like::

    http://.../zope/mathaction/dhmatrix/tangle

I don't think you can chain two methods.  But this isn't really
important since you can use::

    http://.../zope/mathaction/dhmatrix/tangle_axiom

or::

    http://.../zope/mathaction/dhmatrix/tangle?output=axiom

    http://.../zope/mathaction/dhmatrix/tangle?output=axiom&chunk=root

Let me point out the new plugin system that Simon Michael has
implemented for zwiki.  See plugins/ in the zwiki source tree.  (maybe
only in darcs)  One can create a plugin class with the methods you
desire (tangle, tangle_axiom, etc), that get inherited by ZWikiPage and
thus would work with any ZWiki Page.

Hello

Yes, I found some spare time tonight (and hopefully I find some more over the 
weekend) and checked Camm's suggestions:

1) started the axiom commands with ')lisp  (si::readline-off)'
2) started the cmdLine of Popen3 with 'export TERM="dumb"
3) used both changes.

Again, the standalone python code run without errors, whereas the LatexWiki 
page within Zope crashed with WEXITSTATUS=139.

Using the bit of sparetime I also experimented with spawing a process (like 
Axiom) reading from stdin and writing to stdout. Because running an AxiomWiki 
seems to take ages I wanted to check if one could leave Axiom running as a 
server process, just waiting for axiom commands and returning the answers. My 
simple assumptions about pipes in any case did not prove right, so there 
could be odd ways python handles standard input (e.g. via some terminal 
emulation).

As promised I will now try to install ZWiki, LatexWiki and the axiom patch 
again and will let you know a.s.a.p. (but I work as a slow Swiss and I can 
only offer a tested prescription on a Debian system). I am a bit afraid of 
dealing with the synchronisation that is expected with further versions of 
LatexWiki. We'll see.

Cheers, H.P.

I am busy rewriting StructuredText right now.  My goal is to have it
*never* fail.  This is in keeping with the "wiki design
principles":http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiDesignPrinciples .  Right now
StructuredText failes the 'tolerant' criteria.

However, latex/axiom/reduce *cannot* be tolerant since their input must
be precise.  Beyond being syntactically correct it must also be what the
user desired semantically.  Anyway, please take a look at my
WikiDocument attempts (see prev message).  This is the way of the
future.  As you are probably discovering, it can be very difficult, and
sometimes impossible to get two sets of regexes that operate on a
document from clashing.

Still though even with the StructuredText classes (also called STNG),
this is still fundamentally a pile of regexes.  It adds hierarchy.
i.e. in the example [this $x$] I want the link processor [] to get it
first and the latex processor $$ to get it second.  But this is still
not a formally defined grammar.

Python has a module 'Yappy' that is a true C{SLR}, C{LR(1)} and
C{LALR(1)} parser, if it is deemed desirable to formally specify the
syntax of the documents axiom uses.

I have no idea.  Someone will have to try it.

Be careful, down the road I intend to store latexwiki images in the
zodb.  For instance this makes it easier to let the users decide if they
want to see mathml or images.

Please note the "external edit" icon in the upper right corner on the
mathaction wiki.  (the pencil icon)  Configuring a small helper
application with your browser will allow you to automatically open any
wiki page in your favorite editor.

    http://zwiki.org/ExternalEditor

I was just thinking it might be nice to edit axiom/wiki documents with
some of the tex macros I have for vim, which automatically collapse
sections like \begin{axiom}...\end{axiom}.

Note that future plans for latexwiki include a ps/pdf output mode.

Help on this would be appreciated.  I can give pointers.  There's lots
to do.

This is with the packages Debian binary, right?  In this case, it
would seem that axiom/gcl is likely not implicated, but rather
Zope/LatexWiki.  Please let me know if you uncover evidence to the
contrary.

I object to that. There should be only one compiler and this should
probably maintained by the Aldor people. The better way (in my eyes)
would be find a way how to distribute the latest Aldor compiler together
with Axiom or to explain clearly how to proceed to install the compiler
afterwards.

True, but when you want to head for ONE compiler language then I would 
rather move the effort to remove the bugs from the aldor.org compiler 
and not maintaining another program.

Well, true, but where is the manpower?

Excactly.

Hi 

This evening I set-up afresh AxiomWiki on my local system (which I describe as 
far as I find it useful at the end).

This was done on 2004-10-1:

1) Download  ZWiki-0.35.0.tgz from http://www.zwiki.org/FrontPage.

2) (I would have downloaded LatexWiki-0.35, if it had been available as Bob 
McElrath tries to keep LatexWiki and ZWiki in sync. Instead I did the 
following:)

cd /home/LatexW
darcs get http://bob.mcelrath.org/darcs/latexwiki

cd /home/AaxiomW
darcs get http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/latexwiki

cd $ZOPEHOME/lib/python/Products

cp -r /home/LatexW/latexwiki/LatexWiki .
cp -r /home/LatexW/latexwiki/ZWiki .

cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/ReplaceInline* .
cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/*Wrapper.py .
cp /home/AxiomW/latexwiki/LatexWiki/texbreaker* .

(I had to delete ReplaceInlineReduce.py and comment out any line refering to 
Recude in ReplaceInlineLatex.py as I don't have reduce and it does produce an 
error if you leave it.)

3) If necessary, comment out line 24 and 58 in ReplaceInlineLatex.py, both 
referring to Reduce.

4) Edit axiomWrapper.py: on line 85 the string "cmdLine" exports AXIOM. Edit 
it such that it reflects your local Axiom home. In my case:

cd /usr/local/lib/
darcs get http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom

.... make .... 

In axiomWrapper.py:
cmdLine = 'export AXIOM=/usr/local/lib/axiom/mnt/linux;\
                    export PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH;\
                    AXIOMsys < %s' %(axiomFileName)

5) Run the commands you find in texbreaker.mak. (I had the change the include 
file in the gcc command:

-I/usr/include/python2.3 to -I/usr/include/python2.2)

6) Restart zope: /etc/init.d/zope restart

Now it should all be set up and work.


My system:

I run Debian testing (Sarge) with a kernel-image-2.6.7-1-686 (with mostly the 
latest library versions of everything, i.e. not a totally robust system, but 
perfectly fine for me).

Zope Version 
(Zope 2.6.4 (source release, python 2.1, linux2), python 2.2.3, linux2)

Historically the Aldor compiler was intended to be an updated version
of the spad (lisp) compiler. The spad compiler has equivalent syntax
and semantics (modulo the embedded/standalone issues).

It would be better if I worked out a way to package the aldor compiler
with the distribution and kept that up to date and tested. I'll pursue
this offline and let you know the result.

I am unsure. The combination Zope/LatexWiki cannot be the cause, as I produce 
the crashes without using anything from LatexWiki. So it would have to be 
caused by the combination Zope/Axiom. Remember: I create a so called external 
method in zope, which is nothing else than a python program run either within 
Zope or external as a standalone program.

If I am not mistaken, the GCL used in your Debian version is 2.6.4, whereas 
the version I downloaded and compiled uses 2.6.3. Could this be tested? I.e. 
what would I have to do such that my local version uses the latest version of 
GCL? (Checking which versions is available on Debian I see that it is 2.6.5 
or then 2.5; actually, I don't have gcl installed on my system separately.)

Best regards

Hans Peter

Camm,

I think the "evidence to the contrary" might be the fact
that the problem goes away when Hans re-builds Axiom from
CVS sources. Doesn't this isolate the problem to the
Debian binary version of Axiom?

The Debian binary version runs stand alone but segfaults
when run from inside Zope (same code used in both cases).
But after recompiling Axiom, the same code again runs
in *both* places. I can not see how this might be a
Zope/LatexWiki problem.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Excellent, thank you.

I should note that I've been told ZWiki will not support Zope 2.6 for
very much longer.  :(

If you're making a new installation, it's worth your while to use Zope
2.7 and Plone 2.0 (if you want Plone).  I'll try to fix Zope 2.6
incompatibilities in ZWiki when I find them though.

There are debian repositories for both these, but it's not in main
(yet)::

    deb http://nathan.faho.rwth-aachen.de/debian/zope/ ./

the packages are named 'zope2.7' and 'plone'.

I have released LatexWiki 0.35 with some fixes over the previous
version.  (There is one minor fix over the darcs repository you checked
out before 1:45pm PDT 10/1/2004)  I also added a small axiom plug on my
site, and my site is now world-editable.  Feel free to add axiom info if
you are so inclined.

I hope for the next release we can fix these axiom/latexwiki problems
and possibly merge our two development efforts.

OK.

Not always so good. Assume I want to refer in the documentation to the 
name of a function or a variable from some code junk. To me it is 
unclear how I should typeset this. I could use $function()$ or 
$variable$. Or should I use \verb'function()' or perhaps 
\spad{function()} or \axiom{function} or is it better to say 
\alfun{function}? Having a set of canonically predefined tags (latex 
commands) would leave the actual output style to some stylefile. 
Furthermore latex+hyperref (or whatever program) could produce 
hyperlinks if there where predefined tags. But there aren't. (I consider 
\spad and \axiom to be undocumented and therefore not very useful.)

Well, but I feel the hyperlinking from the program to the documentation 
is gone.

Yes, maybe this is the way to go.

> Pamphlet files change the emphasis from programming to writing a document.

That is great, but what if you want to write a new domain A which builds 
on some other (already nicely documented) domain B. You have to know 
every function signature that you intend to use from B by heart or to 
read the whole documentation of B again and again to find the right 
place where an appropriate function is defined. I consider this a 
lengthy process. Better would be to have a summary of the domain 
additionally available (of course automatically generated). Well and for 
that I would use ++ or \begin{functiondescription} ... \end{...}.

It is nowhere said that ++ can only contain a limited set of latex 
commands. It depends very much on the program that takes these comments 
and renders some useful format out of them.

I get a list of signatures. And how do I interpret this list? I have to 
guess from the function's name what it does.

I say it again. I am not opposing the pamphlet style, but I would like 
to keep ++ as an _additional_ feature.

Is there an example somewhere?

I dont like the list of hyperlinks below the green area of

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/Dhmatrix/

very much. In the green area it goes...

R : Join(Field,  TranscendentalFunctionCategory)

Now suppose, I don't know what TranscendentalFunctionCategory is. I 
cannot simply click on it, but must search the appropriate link at the 
bottom. It's a bit inconvenient, but maybe only a question of the right 
program that puts hyperlinks inside the code part. (As far as I know 
actually noweb could do this partly.)

Sad, but true. And AldorDoc (which should do this job) is not much 
progressing at the moment.

The point is that I don't want to repeat the function signature in the 
documentation. They should be taken from the actual code. I would only 
like to add a short note on the function. Repetition introduces the 
possibility of getting out of sync when changing code or documentation.

I know Axiom is a bit different, but for Aldor I would rather just like 
to extract the type lattice from the .al libraries by translating the 
files to the .asy format.

Can you give me a 3 sentence description of the relationship between
Zwiki, Plone, and Zope? I'm clearly confused about it.

Not a problem at all. Indeed, I am happy the aldor mode was mentioned

in order to successfully compile this program I needed to do 2 things:

1) I needed to install a new libbfd. but the fact that the cryptic errors
during compilation didn't explicitely point at this problem is either
just a bug in gcl's configure script, or the fault of some incompletent
installation of binutils on my side. either way, it's probably not your
problem and mentioned in the FAQ anyway. luckily I had some recent
binutils-sources lying around...

2) I needed to alter axiom/src/graph/view3D/Makefile.pamphlet since
putting external include-paths before internal ones in the CFLAGS
did cause "bad things" for me -- i.e. I simply put ${CCF} to the end
of the line where CFLAGS got declared. it might be true that the
existance of header.h in /usr/X11/include is an error on my side,
but I guess that global include-paths getting searched before
program-specific ones is a bad practice anyway.

btw, this is already the 2nd program which clashed with my installation
of cern's "root" into /usr/X11R6, I'd probably better move it away...

Tim,

Let me try to do this for you (Bob: Don't let that stop
you from doing it another way or correcting me ... :)

Zope: is an "integrated application development environment"
consisting of a web server (Zserver) and an object-oriented
database (ZODB) based on the idea of persistent objects
and classes. Zope is written in Python and was originally
a commercial product of Zope Corporation before it went
"open source" (It is still a commercial product in the
sense that Zope Corporation continues to make money from
it's earlier effort, albeit in a different way.)

ZWiki and Plone are two of quite a large number of
applications built using Zope. More specifically these
applications are (usually) build according to a "layered"
architecture that takes full advantage of the object-
orientation at a fairly high level (almost everything
is an object or an attribute of an object, including
web pages, images, files, etc.). Each object has associated
"methods" etc.

Plone is a portal application that is built on top of a
layer called the Content Management Framework (CMF).
CMF provide the object model for distributed management
of website contents. CMF is built directly on Zope.

ZWiki fits into the hierarchy roughly at the same layer
as CMF - just above Zope. Both CMF and ZWiki  define
object types that are inherited by Plone.

--------

Now, are you more confused or less? :) Actually, if you
look at some of the correspondence and history of Zope,
you will find that many (most?) people start out being
quite confused and challenged about this approach. Some
people can't stand it and turn to very different tools
which have similar functionality but are more conventional
such as PHP. Other people are more willing to forget a
lot of the things they thought they knew about computer
systems design and start over, learn Zope from the ground
(Python) up. Often the latter people seem to love it so
much they go one to proselytize about it to others.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Hi:

This is not a response to any particular message in this thread, but I think
some information is useful about the use of old spad source, in particular, the
++ --comments that have produced a lot of thoughtful commentaries. I am not a
system programmer and so I know almost nothing about *how* this is done, just
what was the use of ++ and some -- lines.

It is a pity that the current Open Axiom does not yet have hyperdoc, which is a
great replacement for )show, and a vast multifacet browser way ahead of its time
(or even by today's standard). I understand that those who only have the Open
Axiom version will not have experience with hyperdoc. However, there is a
chapter (Chapter 14) in the Axiom Book that is downloadable that describes
hyperdoc and certainly in lot more details than I am writing about. Those who
know hyperdoc need read no further.

Using hyperdoc, you can (I mention only those related to documentation):

(0)  read the entire Axiom Book, with several views -- by topics, language,
examples, commands, search -- kind of a precursor to Tim's crystal: under
[reference] of hyperdoc.

(1)  get what is equivalent to )show or )display for any constructor, operation,
or attributes; just type the name into a box. But hyperdoc does a lot more. This
is the [browse] function of hyperdoc. These pages, unlike ")show" the output, is
formatted to fit separately in the hyperdoc window, with a scroll bar, and is
out of way of any Axiom computation you are doing. They are derived from spad
source and in particular, the ++ lines.  Once the name is entered (and you can
fill in actual parameters for constructors after that or leave them as
undefined), you get not only the documentation, but you can see ancestors,
dependents, exports, parents, operations, examples, users, attributes and more.
For operations, you get a list of all operations of a certain domain, and you
can get descriptions, parameters, signatures, origins or filter the list. You
can also get hyperlinks to the source spad file for any of the items. If you
have your own version of a spad file and have compiled it, your version is
immediately available.

(2)  test solve problems in five topics: calculus, matrix, draw, series, solve
-- much like a live web page; each topic provides further menus to do a
particular computation. On each page, there are default examples, so you can
just click [continue], or you can fill in the parameters. Surely, this is only a
very, very, small fraction of the library (and can be extended), because the
intention is introduction to Axiom, under [Basic Commands] of hyperdoc. Under
the [Topics] menu, more advanced mathematical topics are available, including
basic commands for them.

(3)  (if the author of the spad source provided examples for the Axiom Book)
select  live examples from [Examples] menu and choose the domain. For example,
if you choose the domain OrderlyDifferentialPolynomial (Section 9.60 of Axiom
Book), you get a demonstration of ODPOL(FRAC INT). When any of the Axiom
statements is selected (click a downarrow icon next to it) the result is
displayed (even if you did not select the ones above it on which it depends).
But there is more. If you double click on the statement instead, a new Axiom
frame (interpreter window) opens and the statement, and all others on which it
depends, are executed in real time, and you can insert Axiom statements of your
own, to test your understanding of the examples. This frame is totally
independent of any other frame(s) that might be opened -- that is, all its
variables are scoped only for that frame, by perhaps a child process. You can
check the dpolcat.spad to see what is done: look for the -- Examples: lines and
what follows. (Yes, the -- lines, which are used and it's so easy!)

    I believe Bob Sutor designed (or patched in) this syntax when he wrote the
Book so he could simply extract these and put them into both hyperdoc and the
Axiom Book. It's too bad that not all spad source provided these examples (what
Tim may have called "testcase"). I don't know if the full code for hyperdoc is
available as open-source, but if so, the grammar of documentation in spad files
can be extracted, and it would be a big waste to throw it away and not built
upon it.

So I would suggest that reviving hyperdoc should be one of the highest
priorities and after that, add examples and better commentaries to the spad
source. The final design of pamphlet files (at least the code segment portions)
can then be built upon the experience with hyperdoc from more people. Hyperdoc
can then be expanded (more topics are included in basic commands), improved (for
example, display the mathematics contained in the pamphlet/LaTeX source), or
morphed into a browser plug-in, or even a web-based version like that in
MathAction.

That's what I'd like to have. If other pages provide the compiler output as
well, ok, but the "dvi-like" output should be the principal page.

Great stuff,

Dear Ralf,

In fact, "fact" can be compiled using aldor 1.0.2 and axiom libraries: see

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-mail/2004-09/msg00035.html

(this mail should really have gone to axiom-developer, sorry.)

Unfurtunately, I did not yet succeed with domains or packages. Maybe you do :-)

Martin

Hi Martin,

I replied to exactly that message. I just wanted to document how to put 
the compiler into the right place.

And as you see from my message. There is a problem (at least on my 
site). How did you compile the file (which I called ff.as)?

Simply, saying )compile ff.as within axiom did not work in my case.
So you must have a slightly different setup.

Ralf

I'll try to stick to 3 sentences.  ;)

Zope is a pile of python code that is a web server and set of classes
for manipulating web-data stored in its object-oriented database via
what one could think of as a merging of server-side scripting and object
orientation.  Plone is a very pretty and popular "portal" application
built on top of Zope that allows high-level control like multiple users,
owners, access rights, publication rules, and web-based site management.
ZWiki is a powerful wiki implementation that allows several forms of
input type (StructuredText, WikiWikiWeb, MoinMoin, and now Latex) and
because it is built on Zope it is more powerful but not as simple as the
original Wiki idea.

I'll add an answer to one more question you didn't ask directly: If
you're not familiar with the wiki concept, it is intended to be editable
by anyone, simple enough that when anyone runs across it they can
contribute meaningfully by creating content or organization, the pages
themselves have a simple syntax that resembles the web-page output, and
pages are automatically interlinked via the use of camel-case
noun-phrase WikiWord .  This openness and chaos counter-intuitively
*does* result in organization, widespread contribution, and high-quality
content.  In some sense it is the opensource philosophy applied to
documents.

    http://wiki.org/wiki.cgi?WhatIsWiki
    http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiDesignPrinciples

And now I've gotten beyond 3 sentences and am just rambling.  Bill and I
seem to be good at this.  So let's see how many foreign concepts we've
piled on:

    Object-Oriented
    Wiki
    Literate Programming

Not to mention LaTeX, Computer Algebra, Open Source, Zope, ZWiki, Plone.
I just hope the set of concepts most people will have to figure out
isn't so large that this project will have difficulty attracting
contributors.  Your early confusion is a bad sign...  I think I've got
them all mostly figured out except "literate programming".

Wiki's generally have a good number of "curious" edits...people that
come along and think "can I really edit this?"  "What happens if I do?"
and this is to be encouraged because it then leads to more interest...
Pages must also be simple enough that newbies can figure out what it is
when they hit "edit".  The previous discussion of literate
programming/++ comments and document sections...results in a very
complex, non-intuitive document to a newcomer...

Since this Axiom wiki is destined to be relatively complex, a good start
would be to add a simple set of instructions to the editform.

Hi Martin:

I don't know if you automatically get comments to your bug posts. So I am
forwarding this (slightly edited from the posted version: I can't re-edit what I
posted) to you. I want also to add that EXPR INT is used within UTS rather than
FRAC POLY INT is probably because the coefficients of the Taylor series usually
involve factorials (I guess, hidden in Stream EXPR INT).

William

-------- Original Message --------

bug #10350 overview: integrating UTS

Neither of these is a bug. In the first one, Axiom coerced 1/x into FRAC POLY
INT correctly: the only / operation available in UTS is one induced from the
coefficient domain, which requires the denominator to be in the coefficient
domain, and the division is done termwise to the coefficients of the series. So
1/x ends up in FRAC POLY INT. Note that to obtain a Taylor series at x = 0 is
mathematically is wrong, since 1/x is not defined at x=0. Also the way to obtain
a Taylor series is taylor(func, x=a). If you do integrate(taylor(1/x,x=1),x),
that would cause no problems. Note that the domain of this command is UTS(EXPR
INT, x,1), so such towers are valid and necessary in Axiom. Note also there are
only two exported [coerce] in UTS and they do NOT apply to 1/x.  The x in UTS is
like the x in UP and is different from the x in FRAC POLY INT. The
representation is Stream Coef (no variable specified because it is univariate).

For the same reason, in the second command, 1/y is correctly coerced into FRAC
POLY INT. However, in UTS(*,x,*), the only integrations allowed are with respect
to x. If you want to do integration in FRAC POLY INT, then you should do so
without coercing 1/y into UTS.

So your examples do not illustrate the problem about mixed up variables. In
fact, they support use of towers like UTS(EXPR INT, x, a).

Bob, I think you are absolutely right to be concerned about
this. It probably is too complex and it probably is already
having difficulty attracting contributors. I really don't
know what to expect.

The problem is, even the simplest version of what I (we?)
would like to do with all this seems to be too complex -
just Zope + LatexWiki + Axiom. In fact, surely some might
claim that LaTeX is too complex, doing algebra by computer
is too complex, wiki-based collaboration is too complex ...
even individually.

> Your early confusion is a bad sign...  I think I've got

No doubt there could be a mix of similar admissions by
people reading this: "I think I know enough about 'x' and
'z' but what is 'y'? Actually this is not such a bad state
to be in and maybe a good reason to be hanging out here.

In my case I certainly might say: I think I've got them
all mostly figured out except "types in Axiom". :)

>

Yes, again I agree completely. So far MathAction has only had
what I think is a rather small number of "curiosity edits" in
spite of being fully open. To really know for sure I guess
would might have to take a look at the web logs and set how
the ratio of 'page views' to 'page edits' is compared to other
wiki.

But I have made only limited attempts, mostly indirect, to
advertise MathAction. I am open to suggestions as to how
best to approach this, if at all.

More broadly speaking, I think the Axiom project as a whole
could use more PR. I think there are some quickly evolving
ways to do this on the Internet ranging from being mentioned
in popular blogs to an article in a part-paper / part-electronic
trade magazine. But someone has to step up to the task of
preparing the equivalent of "press notices" etc. We might
worry that "we are not ready yet" for such publication, but
on the other hand one of the reasons we are not ready yet
could well be *because* of the lack of publication.

One of the reasons for my reacting quickly to the possibility
of adding Reduce to MathAction was the thought that sharing
the available audience might be beneficial to both. Of course,
as we say on the FrontPage of MathAction this potentially
extends to other computer algebra systems as well. I have
not seen many comments pro or con about this strategy.

> Pages must also be simple enough that newbies can figure
> out what it is when they hit "edit".

You are right to imply that MathAction does not meet the
usual wiki design goals very well in this respect. But I
think it is first necessary to define what we consider
the target audience for this system to be. For example,
if the result of clicking "edit" and seeing a LaTeX
format-like input file would be interpreted as too complex,
then I am inclined to think that perhaps we have set the
bar a little too low to start with. But I am quite open
to other opinions on this.

> The previous discussion of literate programming/++
> comments and document sections... results in a very

That is true, however even the fill-in-the-box-and-click-
save" comment box at the bottom of each page seems (so far)
to be little used. Therefore I do think that the main
problem so far is that the audience is just too small. I am
quite reluctant to believe that the underlying complexity
is so obvious to first come page viewers that it prevents
them from even commenting. :(

This a good suggestion. We already have a "For editing help,
see HelpPage. But I presume you mean something a little more
"in your face"?

BTW, has anyone thought of providing a settable user
preference that might allow one to select the amount of
help and other verbosity that one might want to see, e.g.
"I'm an expert, don't bother me with that stuff", "I
still need a little help", "I am a novice user who needs
some serious hand holding", etc.

--------

Ok, back to work. Where did I put that Python code that
I was just working on ... 

Regards,
Bill Page.

William,

I greatly appreciate your discussion of hyperdoc. I think you are
quite right to observe that open axiom is at a serious disadvantage
because of the lack of this part of the former commercial product.

Yes I think the full code for hyperdoc is (or will be) available
as open source but it has not yet been ported to use a modern
graphical user interface. That is a big job even for someone
fully familiar with gui programming.

We did have some previous discussion of this. For references
see:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/cgi-bin/namazu.cgi?query=3Dhyperdoc&submit=3D=
Search
%21&idxname=3Daxiom-developer&max=3D10&result=3Dnormal&sort=3Dscore

In particular see

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-07/msg00068.html

for much of that documentation.

The pamphlet files now contain all of the spad source code (including
all comments). Editing the commentaries for xxx.spad now means editing
the associated xxx.spad.pamphlet file. The code part of these files
is automatically extracted and used during the Axiom build process.

I notice that in

Since the functionality of TechExplorer is not so different from
what is possible under LatexWiki, Mike's comment makes me feel
optimistic that it would be possible to implement a large part
of hyperdoc in MathAction.

Dear Bill,

first of all: you are doing a wonderful job.

second: I also thought about advertising axiom, BUT, from some experience I had
with close collegs, I am absolutely sure that the following things should be
done before:

* The known math-bugs should be corrected or at least workarounds provided.

  We are in pretty good shape here. From those bugs I *know*, the following two
  are the only ones I'd consider serious: #9217 and #10530. However, there are
  workarounds for both, so I wouldn't consider them as a show stopper.

* editing pamphlets via MathAction should work.

  It seems that we are in good shape here, too. (I think this is a great
  feature)

* Aldor should work as compiler for Axiom

  Rationale: We could attract (and join) the Aldor community here. Furthermore,
  I think that people would gain confidence, since Aldor is probably considered
  more stable than spad.

  Camm, if you are reading this, maybe you can help?

* Windows port.

  Don't know anything about this.

I think we could advertise in the following communities:

* Math and Computeralgebra (via PlanetMath, newsgroups, special math portals I
  don't know by heart, groups like the RISC in Linz)

* Lisp (a CMUCL/SBCL port would be nice. I think some work has been done here
  already)

* LateX and TeXmacs (why not. MathAction and the pamphlet project is related to
  LaTeX)

* emacs. Yes, I think we should make as much noise as possible.

* MuPAD-combinat. Ask them for cooperation, I know that some of them are
  interested.

* Maxima

I think it was *very* clever. I think it would be clever to add Maxima, too,
But one thing after the other.

Thanks again,

Martin

Dear Bill:

Thanks for taking the time to send me links to discussion on hyperdoc.
Unfortunately, 

(1) The search page produce no document:

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/cgi-bin/namazu.cgi?query=hyperdoc&submit=Search%21&idxname=axiom-developer&max=10&result=normal&sort=score

Search String: hyperdoc   [How to search]

Results:
References: [ (can't open the index) ] 

No document matching your query.

Do I have to login in?

(2) I don't follow this document at all (lack of tex and unix expertise):

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-07/msg00068.html

So I don't think I will be able to do much in terms of contributing to this.

Does that mean sman is not open source? I know that hyperdoc will interact with
the interpreter when one enters the actual parameters to a constructor while
browsing in hyperdoc. In fact, sometimes the interpreter will give an error
message if the parameters are not right.

I also think that hyperdoc has a lot more functionality than TechExplorer
offers. It is true that hyperdoc does not give pretty font output (especially
math), but I'll pass over beauty for utility anytime. Formatting is a very
painstaking job and difficult to do it right (even when done manually and
interactively). It is great that you and so many others devoted so much time to
improve Open Axiom.


Regards,

William

Recall that this is an open source project.  We are all working in our
spare time.  If we define a set of deliverables that we deem "important"
before outsiders start flooding in, they may very well never get done.

It is very tempting to do this.  We all want the stuff we're working on
to be perfect before we show other people.  However, this attitude is a
hinderance in an open source project.

All that is required for rapid evolution is a *working* codebase.  We
can afford to attract newcomers to an unfinished project.  As long as it
*runs* (with bugs), newcomers can run into those bugs and will be
motivated to try and fix them.  So, make sure that each release
compiles, runs, and passes test cases (same for MathAction) and the
project will grow.

Release early, release often.

Given the nature of axiom, perhaps it we could put warnings in the code
that would be printed to the user in cases where axiom is returning
known-wrong results.  I don't know the difficulty of this suggestion.
Comments?

No you don't have to log in. But do be sure that you use the
full url. It should start with http:// and end with &sort=score
If you are using an email program that allows you to just "click
the link" perhaps it was split across two or more lines - this
happens in a lot of email packages with plain ascii messages
and long urls.

The full url works fine for me, but I get exactly the message you
show if I use a url that (incorrectly) ends at query=hyperdoc

Bill Page.

Hi Bill;

OK, thanks. It works now. I was "fooled" by the Undefined Archive Search page:
it is not a 404, but a genuine, workable page with search buttons, etc (when I
looked at the URL *refreshed* by the site, it begins and ends correctly)! So I
typed in the keyword and chose parameters and the URL string looks fine --
except that in the URL, the idxname was replaced by "undefined" instead of
"axiom-developer".  I think the site should return a URL not found rather than a
working page. Or, at the very least, the "link" to "Undefined Archive" should
give an appropriate message, or that page should give a choice of idxnames.

Will read these more fully when I can get around to them. After sampling a few
old messages, I do recall these discussions (I have been reading roughly 90% of
the discussions, though some more carefully than others).

William

sman is (or will be) open source but as far as I know it
has not yet been fully re-integrated. I believe that sman
is necessary to manage the communication between axiom
and auxillary programs like graphics and hyperdoc. My
limited understanding is that to get this all to work
requires the solution of some compatibility problems with
how network sockets work with GCL. Unfortunately Tim Daly
seems to be the only open axiom developer at this time
with the skills needed to solve this problem - and he is
in rather short supply... :(

Can you give some examples of such functionality?

Hello,

Somebody interested in the following style code?

It redefines the \nwbegincode and \nwendcode commands of noweb.sty to
achieve shaded code areas in the dvi output.

There is not need to change anything in the .nw/.pamphlet file.

The 'framed' package seems to be a standard package in the latex
distribution.

But be warned, not every dvi viewer is able to handle colors.

For me it works with

home> kdvi --version
Qt: 3.3.3
KDE: 3.2.3
KViewShell: 0.2

and does not work with

home> xdvi --version
xdvik version 22.40v
Copyright (C) 1990-2002 Paul Vojta and others.


Just put the files below into some directory, go there and say

noweave -n file.nw > file.nw.tex
latex wrapper.tex

Ralf Hemmecke


%%-- BEGIN wrapper.tex -- %%
\documentclass{article}

\usepackage{noweb}

\usepackage{color}
\usepackage{framed}
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{0.8,0.8,0.8}
\let\rhxnwbegincode\nwbegincode
\let\rhxnwendcode\nwendcode
\def\nwbegincode#1{\begin{shaded}\rhxnwbegincode{#1}}
\def\nwendcode#1{\rhxnwendcode{}\end{shaded}}

\begin{document}
\input{file.nw}
\end{document}
%%-- END wrapper.tex -- %%




%%-- BEGIN file.nw -- %%
So let us first define the first code part.
<<Code 1>>=
one one
one
@ %def one

And now the second code part.

<<Code 2>>=
two one two
@

Putting everything together...
<<*>>=
<<Code 1>>
<<Code 2>>
@
%%-- END file.nw -- %%

One can achieve colored code areas in the html output of noweb by
sneaking some style code into the generated .html file.

Noweb produces the code area set in <pre> ... </pre>, so adding

<style type="text/css">
pre { background : lightgray }
</style>

between <head> ... </head> would achieve this.

Or put it into

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage/stylesheet

as a default for <pre>.

Unfortunately, the above CSS code modifies ALL <pre> environments. That 
may be undesirable.

Sorry, I should have quoted

as well:

where $AXIOMSRC/src/share/algebra should be the directory that contains

You are quite right. That's why I tried to be modest. (I failed, it seems?)

The reason I put together this list is that I'm afraid of the following:

* we attract a lot of people, among them many professional researchers, those
  who *I* want to attract most.

* they try it out.

* they find: hey, this could be nice, but in the current state, its just
  unusable for my research, because ... (insert good reason here)

* they never look at it again.

Note that I'm talking mainly about professional researchers.  From my
experience with collegues in combinatorics, I'm confident (unfortunately) that
this would happen.

Regarding my scientific community, bugs #9217 and #10530 are most important. I
don't know about the others. If these two are well documented, I think they are
not such a big problem. In fact, if I manage to release my guessing package at
roughly the same time, I'd probably attract quite some interest. This should be
doable before next monday. 

So, probably you are quite right. 

Tim, do you know about the current state of affairs of the items on

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/TodoList

?

Can we merge the patches submitted to

http://savannah.nongnu.org/patch/?group=axiom

and do a first release?

Note that I do not have the right to change the priority of a bug.

Dear Axiom Community,

I extend the to-do list on MathAction by some further "nice to have" items and
a list of cummunities to inform of a first release.

Maybe somebody could extend the "phycisians" point!

Also, maybe you know a group with some special interest that might be served by
Axiom or MathAction.

Please edit!

Martin

Actually there isn't a single thing that you could do in HyperDoc that
you couldn't do in our TechExplorer-based Windows interface, and in
practice the latter was much more natural to work with because it was
more closely integrated into the standard Axiom user-interface.

To clarify, there are two parts of HyperDoc.  The first is a set of
static pages (such as the Axiom book) which are indexed in different
ways.  In some cases links are embedded to allow an Axiom interpreter
frame to be spawned and commands executed in it (either with fixed data
or with data entered via a form-style interface) but that's really the
limit of the dynamic behaviour.

The second is the browser which is driven from the Axiom databases and
generates pages dynamically.  This means that if you add your own code
or change existing code in an Axiom session then the browser view will
reflect this.  You can inspect the exports of a particular type, browse
through its inheritance structure, find all domains which belong to a
particular category ...  Quite honestly I'm amazed (and impressed!) that
anybody can use Axiom seriously without the browser!

When we moved to CCL and ported Axiom to Windows we had to completely
re-write the browser code because it was entirely unix-specific.  This
coincided with a re-design of the databases to make them more compact
and faster to access (a lot of this work was actually done by IBM, and
particularly by the late Dick Jenks).  Unfortunately part of that work
included adding a "grep" function to CCL, so unless that code is ported
to GCL you'll have problems getting the existing browser to work in
OpenAxiom.

As far as user interfaces go, under Unix we stuck with the X11-based
HyperDoc, but under Windows we used TechExplorer.  The static pages
described above work without Axiom being present in both cases (although
obviously the dynamic bits won't work).  The browser requires Axiom to
be present, and on Unix this implies that sman is available.

Personally I'd have thought that you could adapt the TechExplorer
browser code to work with either the TeXmacs or Mathaction interfaces
since in principle they're all very similar.  You'll need to solve the
"grepping with GCL" issue first though.

Cheers, Mike.

Yes, that was exactly my thought and I would like to try
to get a start on it, having worked with both the TeXmacs
and MathAction interfaces. However right now I feel a distinct
lack of documentation on how the browser code works, combined
with the lack of working example code, is going to make this
very difficult (for me, at least).

Camm,

Do you know of any successful reports of GCL on Debian Arm,
in particular with Debian on Zaurus?

Recently I have managed to install native debian on the
Zaurus SL-6000. Following the recipes at

  http://pocketworkstation.org/ 

and 

 
http://www.zaurususergroup.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=phpWiki&file=inde
x&pagename=Debian%20on%20the%20Zaurus! 

Debian seems to run great including apt-get etc. although
I do have a problem with the X-windows Fbvnc thing. See

  http://externe.net/zaurus/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1473

Of course the first thing I though of after getting apt-get
running was to install axiom. This went thru fine (takes
a fairly long time - about 2 hours) and seems to complete
normally. BUT when I tried to start axiom it aborted immediately
with a "Segmentation violation". Most other Debian arm
applications however seem to run fine. So I thought I would
try gcl itself. After a little rearranging of the limited
space on the Zaurus SD card, I managed to apt-get install
gcl. But :( it also seg faults on startup. Then I noticed
that when I searched for Debian packages via the web, there
is a version 5.9.1-2 for debian arm. Unfortunately it also
seg faults. So, in desperation I thought I might try maxima...
seg fault. Then I noticed that pocketworkstation.org had a
slightly older version of maxima_5.9.0-27_arm.deb
(apt-get install found version-28) as the current. But it
seems that version-27 was built using clisp ... <sigh>. So,
apt-get install clisp. Surprize! clisp works fine (+ 1 1).
And downloading the maxima version-27 from pocketworkstation
and running dpkg --install works! 1+1; So I am +2 for clisp
and maxima but zip for gcl and axiom :(

Can you suggest what I might try next? If GCL really does
work on arm (I presume it does work on some arm system or
it wouldn't be in the debian archive at all, right?) What
could be wrong with the Zaurus configuration? Could there
be some library dependency that apt-get is not resolving
properly?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Greetings!  Great to see your looking into this!

This has got to be a libc version dependency issue.  The author of
http://pocketworkstation.org/ appears to be putting together his own
Debian snapshots.  But if you apt-get upgrade to the standard Debian
distribution, all that should be taken care of.  Perhaps you could
send your /etc/apt/sources.list, and 'dpkg -l |grep libc'.  5.9.1-2 is
not a recognizable gcl version.  You are correct in stating that axiom
had to run (at least the regression suite) to be in Debian at all.
You can see the full results at:

http://buildd.debian.org/fetch.php?&pkg=axiom&ver=0.20040831-1&arch=arm&stamp=1094488923&file=log&as=raw

This was built using:

Toolchain package versions: libc6-dev_2.3.2.ds1-13 gcc-3.3_1:3.3.4-7 g++-3.3_1:3.3.4-7 binutils_2.15-2 libstdc++5_1:3.3.4-7 libstdc++5-3.3-dev_1:3.3.4-7

and generated dependencies:

 Depends: libc6 (>= 2.3.2.ds1-4), libgmp3, libncurses5 (>= 5.4-1), libreadline4 (>= 4.3-1), axiom-databases (= 0.20040831-1)


Please make sure these match your system (which should be automatic
when using apt, but there may be something residual from
'pocketworkstation') 

There are also some known bugs listed on the webpage -- none of these
are applicable I assume.

I've just double checked the general integrity of the arm binary.
(ran in both the 'testing' and 'unstable' chroot environments, which
is a requirement, of course) Here is a sample session in case this
helps:

Camm,

Sorry, you are right. My email was confusing. I was
talking about 5.9.1-2 for maxima (unstable)

  http://packages.debian.org/unstable/math/maxima

There is also a 5.9.0-28 and apparently a 5.9.0-27 (clisp)
version of maxima. Niether the 5.9.1-2 or 5.9.0-28 versions
of maxima worked for me.

Thanks for the other information. Perhaps an app-get
upgrade is indeed a good idea. I will let you know what
happens...

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi Tim.

I spent some time this morning on Windows Axiom with particular reference to
the sometimes on, sometimes off problem with compiling AHYP.spad:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
   initializing NRLIB AHYP for ArcHyperbolicFunctionCategory
The syntax of the command is incorrect.
Error: equal: x is a NULL pointer
Fast links are on: do (si::use-fast-links nil) for debugging
Error signalled by RETURN.
Broken at APPLY.  Type :H for Help.
BOOT>>
------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a couple of problems here:

1. interpsys thinks that the syntax of some command or other is incorrect,
and

2. the error system ends up with a NULL pointer in the GCL C code.

I managed to isolate problem 2 to a simple case: evaluating 2*y at the
interpsys prompt, which in my incomplete system leads immediately to an
attempt to load the as yet uncompiled polynomial domain code in POLY.o,
hence an error and then the NULL pointer.

I then found that in "g-error.boot.pamphlet" the function  "sayErrorly()"
calls "saturnSayErrorly()" which contains the output stream variable
_*STANDARD_-OUTPUT_*.

Altering that line as follows restores order to the error reporting:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
$ cvs diff src/interp/g-error.boot.pamphlet
Index: src/interp/g-error.boot.pamphlet
===================================================================
RCS file: /cvsroot/axiom/axiom/src/interp/g-error.boot.pamphlet,v
retrieving revision 1.3
diff -r1.3 g-error.boot.pamphlet
175c175
<   _*STANDARD_-OUTPUT_* : fluid := $texOutputStream
---
>   *STANDARD-OUTPUT* : fluid := $texOutputStream
---------------------------------------------------------------------

However I then found that similar strange variations on various IO related
variables and functions exist in the interpreter code as shown further down.

Are these constructs intentional (perhaps some kind of TeXism which my TeX
system is not handling properly for example) or an unfortunate editing
error?

Cheers

Mike Thomas.

Mike,

In your example code:


  c:/cvs/head/axiom/src/interp/i-syscmd.boot.pamphlet:    line :=
read_-line(files
tream,false)

which appears to be line 1319 in my sources my copy reads:

    line := read_-line(filestream,false)

Since this line is from the original pamphlet file TeX is not involved.
The pamphlet files are hand coded.

Did you pass these files thru a DOS or Windows system or editor?
I don't see where the random linebreaks could come from.
Clearly the line of code you gave has a syntax error.

Very odd. I'm at a loss to explain it. Check the file modification
times and see if some process touched the file and made it later 
than the surrounding pamphlet files.

Tim

Mike,

These symbols with _ look like standard Axiom escapes to
me. In Axiom (starting probably at the bootsys level)
the underscore character acts the same as the \ in C.
I am quite surprized therefore that your change to the
g-error.boot.pamphlet code, removing the _ even compiles
at all. In the bootsys language (as in the Axiom language
itself)

 *STANDARD-OUTPUT* : fluid := $texOutputStream

should be a syntax error because of the unescaped special
symbols appearing on the left.

 ... hmmm.

I would look for reasons why the _ are apparently not
being interpreted properly as escapes.

And I'm really glad you are back looking at Axiom on
Windows! It is entirely resistant to my feeble attempts
to figure it out!

Regards,
Bill Page.

Tim,

I don't think the problem here has anything to do with
strange line breaks. As far as I can tell these are
artifically inserted by the email system on long lines.
The issue that Mike was pointing at was the use of the
_ in the name

  read_-line

My explanation is that the _ acts as an escape so that
- is parsed as part of the name and not an operator.
Does this make sense to you? Is it true that this use
of _ appears first at the bootsys level of the code?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi Bill.

| These symbols with _ look like standard Axiom escapes to
| me. In Axiom (starting probably at the bootsys level)
| the underscore character acts the same as the \ in C.
| I am quite surprized therefore that your change to the
| g-error.boot.pamphlet code, removing the _ even compiles
| at all. In the bootsys language (as in the Axiom language
| itself)
|
|  *STANDARD-OUTPUT* : fluid := $texOutputStream
|
| should be a syntax error because of the unescaped special
| symbols appearing on the left.
|
|  ... hmmm.
|
| I would look for reasons why the _ are apparently not
| being interpreted properly as escapes.

-------------------------------------------------
Thanks for the info - will do.


| And I'm really glad you are back looking at Axiom on
| Windows! It is entirely resistant to my feeble attempts
| to figure it out!

The Windows Axiom failure is the last GCL boundary I need to push back and
so I hope to focus more closely on it.  Unfortunately GCL itself is rapidly
evolving under pressure from the Unix side and that usually spells more work
and therefore distraction from Axiom.

Cheers

Mike Thomas.

Camm,

See the GOOD NEWS below.

I did the 'apt-get upgrade', unfortunately I still get
immediate seg faults from both Axiom and GCL.

If what I am seeing is the same seg fault, then it seems
very sensitive to the libc6 version and libc6 2.3.2.ds1-16
may also not work for arm on Zaurus with the debian arm
build of GCL.

------------

But the GOOD NEWS is that I did manange to build GCL from the
2.6.5 tarball from the Axiom CVS! First I did

# apt-get build-dep gcl
# tar xzvf axiom/zips/gcl-2.6.5.tgz
# cd gcl-2.6.5
# ./configure --enable-vssize=3D65536*1 --disable-statsysbfd \
  --enable-locbfd --enable-maxpage=3D32*1024

Note use of locbfd and smaller memory parameters then currently
specified in the Axiom build:

# ./configure --enable-vssize=3D65536*4 --enable-statsysbfd \
  --enable-maxpage=3D128*1024

which gave "Can't allocate" message when first trying to run
raw_pre_gcl. I got the same result with the default ./configure.
But using --enable-locbfd did the trick and it is now working
fine. I am not sure how much bigger I can practically make the
memory options, but I think parameters might be too large.
Can you tell how large they can be set based on the output
of 'free' below?

So, anyway I am now running an Axiom build with=20

# ./configure --enable-vssize=3D65536*2 --disable-statsysbfd \
  --enable-locbfd --enable-maxpage=3D64*1024

I will let you know how (if) it finishes some time tomorrow.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill,

I wrote the SuchThat domain as part of my PhD thesis work.
The basic idea was to be able to wrap domains with provisos.
You would be able to say 

 1/x such that x != 0

I think you've pinned it here.  The virtual memory size of the gcl
default build is 81Mb, and you only have 62.  

If you want to double check you can

gdb /usr/lib/gcl-2.6.5/unixport/saved_gcl
r
bt

and see where the fault is.

The default hole size is 1/10 MAXPAGES, which with the default maxpage
setting is 52Mb.  It is not actually in use until allocated, but the
space must be available nonetheless.  Not sure how tiny axiom itself
can be made, but you can shrink the hole size, giving you finer
grained increments to the growing heap at the expense of gc time, if
things really get tight.

Wondering if you can just setup a swapfile over nfs to see if the
default binary will work for you.

As you have not cleared the fault with an upgrade, and as you are now
running the same libc as I did on the verification run I posted, this
is unrelated to Bob's earlier, presumably alpha specific transient
libc instability, I think.

You probably won't succeed, but might just luck out.  The AXIOMsys
virtual memory size is actually a little less than the default gcl
vmsize, as it shaves off 4k pages from the relocatable area to more
than compensate for the expanded number of pages for cells:

I get 74Mb.  Can you get some swap somewhere?  My test arm machine has
the same amount of ram, but generous swap at 256M, which is certainly
overkill for the present purpose.

Take care,

Tim,

This seems quite fascinating to me - and quite a powerful idea
as an Axiom type, though at first thought as a 'type' it does
seem a little strange.

You wouldn't happen to have a copy of that PhD thesis online
somewhere, would you? Is there some part of it that we could
extract as documentation for SuchThat?

Tim, were you also involved in writing the EigenPackage,
PolynomialIdeals, RadicalEigenPackage and RadicalSolvePackage
packages? How was it decided to make use of SuchThat in these
cases?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Ah, would that I did have my PhD thesis online. Since I don't have a
PhD (after 11 years :-) ) it's unlikely to ever be online.  My thesis
topic was on "Provisos". These are fundamental mathematical constraints
on the domain and range of functions. Every computation should produce
them, carry them, and compute the interaction between them. SuchThat
is essentially a "storage" mechanism to wrap results with provisos.
Axiom output should be qualified not just by type but also with the
corresponding provisos. You see this all the time in math textbooks.

I do have some documents moldering in the history pile but it's
probably better if I write the SuchThat docs from scratch. In fact,
there are several improvements I could make.

I didn't write the domains that use it. That was Manuel Bronstein.
He and I had several discussions about the subject.

The interaction between provisos, the domains, and the elements of the
domains is quite complex and absolutely fundamental to computational
mathematics. I never really published anything about my investigations
of the subject. I understand how to compute with them and have some
interesting research results.  I even have a primitive implementation
somewhere on a floppy disk (which I probably can't read
anymore). Axiom clearly needs to develop the proviso capability but
that's a real research issue and the NSF no longer supports that kind
of research. Perhaps one of Buchberger, Bronstein, or Davenport's
students will take up the torch.

What sparked your interest in SuchThat?

Yes. I think Maple and Mathematica both are moving in this
direction, albiet not with the notion of a Type. Instead they
are tending to return more results as 'piecewise' conditionals.

I was looking for a non-trivial example of 'numeric' versus
'symbolic' mathematics to discuss at the AMS meeting this
weekend. Symbolic eigenvalue computations have been of
interest to me before. So I loooked at section 8.4 of the
AXIOM book (page 241 in the original book). When I tried
the example eq. (1) I found that it produced a result
slightly different than the book.

http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone/Members/billpage/MathAction2

The 'extra' result was in the form of a SuchThat type.

So in the end, this did not (quite) turn out to be the
numeric computational result that I had expected!

Regards,
Bill Page.

In fact the more I think about it, I wonder why the
author choose to return the 2nd and 3rd eigenvalues
in this problem only implicitly. Was it only for
compactness? In the case of problems of low degree the
roots could easily have been given numerically as shown
in the calculation. Perhaps it was for generality?
There is some new algorithm, isn't there, for finding
roots of polynomials of any degree?

Bill Page.

So, if I set --enable-maxpage=64*1024, then the default
hole size would be --enable-holepage=6*1024, right? How
small can I practically make it?

I am willing to try but I have never done this. Can you
given me a few (explicit) tips how to proceed? It is
also apparently possible for me to connect a usb disk
drive to this BIG MACHINE in the small box (: Yes, I am
very impressed by the SL-6000! :) There is a nice little
40 Gbyte drive that runs directly off the usb power for
about $200. Perhaps I will run down to the store when
it is open again tomorrow...

Maybe I should just admit that running Axiom isn't (quite)
practical on this system unless I can add swap space?
But as a continued challenge, I note that I can run Clisp
and maxima under Clisp in much less space without swap.

Well you were right. The build stopped apparently at the point
were it was about to create depsys (it built bootsys ok). See
the build log below. Does the message "Can't allocate buffer"
tell you anything specific about memory?

Yes, tomorrow.

You can set it to whatever you want with
--enable-holepage=.... ./configure --help gives all the options.  If a
heap grows from x to y with holepage z, a gc will be triggered at
least (y-x)/z times.

See my previous post re: nbd.  I think there is a good howto on the
net.  Please write back if you don't find it and I'll take a look.

This is something we can work on if we agree it is a priority.  GCL
has recently redesigned its default memory layout parameters for
speed.  We are therefore a bit more generous with allocations than we
used to be, but still small relative to cmucl and the like, I think.
two word cons, copying gc algorithm for all types, etc. provide quite
a bit of room for shrinkage.  We've tried to aim for the best
compromise for today's average computer.

Well, that you are out of it :-)  You failed at mmaping the space for
the final image save in unexec.

Martin,

I am sorry that I do not have anything integrated with
MathAction yet. I ran into a few problems with my modifications
of the l2h (latex to html) noweave -filter and am still
making changes to fix this before adding it to LatexWiki.

In some cases the internal HTML linkages created by
noweave mess up the selected pass thru of the Latex
coding like \begin{equation} and \begin{axiom} because
noweave assume that the output of the l2h filter will be
*pure* html with nothing "strange" embedded like LaTeX
coding. The LatexWiki html+latex document type is a
little strange in that it permits (expects?) the LaTeX
coding just to be inserted in the HTML even though the
the syntax of these two languages is not really compatible.

There are also related problems about how l2h likes to
convert \ref{} to equation \label{} versus the way that
LatexWiki is doing it now. LatexWiki insists on renumbering
equations and that is not compatible with the links that
were earlier inserted by l2h. Plus the insertion of html
anchors for the equations is messed up by the way that
I coded the pass thru of LaTeX coding.

I think what I need to do is have the l2h filter wrap the
LaTeX in a special "html-like" tag e.g.

  <latex>
  \begin{equation}
  ...
  \end{equation}

  Some paragraph

  \begin{axiom}
  ...
  \end{axiom}
  </latex>

Then (hopefully) the rest of the noweave indexing mechanism
wont insist on inserting html inside these html tags.

Anyway, I will be away at a meeting (and short vacation)
for the next 10 days so don't expect much progress until
later this month.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I have been rewriting the StructuredText document type in the last week
or so, and have decided that html+latex must go away because these two
languages are not compatible.  Specifically, latex can contain less-than
and greater-than symbols, and it is not possible to disentangle latex
=66rom html tags.

I have decided on the following "new" pagetypes:
   =20
    o stx + latex -- cannot contain html, latex is "higher-priority" so
    that e.g. [$a$] is a wiki link with an equation and $[a]$ is an
    equation with brackets in it (and not a wikilink).  There will also
    be a backend which renders mini-latex (below) to generate printable
    (ps/pdf) output.

    o mini-latex -- just enough latex markup to get stx functionality,
    and will render if passed to latex, but will actually be processed
    by the StructuredText machinery as a new pagetype.  i.e. it will
    know \begin{itemize}, \item, \cite, \tt, \bf, \it, etc and not
    require a preamble.

    o latex -- true latex, will be passed to latex2html or tth for the
    web, pdflatex for printable output.

It is only possible to mix html and latex if we require that latex
escape the characters <>&.  This seems very difficult, especially for
hand-coded latex, but maybe your generator can do it?  I am debating
whether stx+latex needs a true escaping mechanism.  I think we can only
retain html+latex if we require the embedded latex to be escaped
properly.

The hyperref and "hypextra":http://www-ssc.igpp.ucla.edu/~newbury/manual/hy=
pextra.html
packages allow one to embed HTML in latex but require latex-style tags
like \htmladdimg.  (see also tex4ht)

My latest work is here::

    http://bob.mcelrath.org/WikiStructuredText

right now it duplicates the ZWiki functionality.  (These classes will be
added to ZWiki and replace stx.py)  I have not added latex yet.  I hope
by looking at WikiDocument.py and WikiHTML.py it is obvious what to do.

I have much work to do here before getting to latexwiki -- like
integrating the WikiLink mechanism and merging with ZWiki.

I want to use \ref and \label instead.  Hopefully this will make it in
the next release.  But if you beat me to making a patch for this, please
send it along!

Even this is treacherous.  A mark of a good markup system is that it has
the proper escaping to write a document about itself.  It is obtuse, but
can you place the string "</latex>" inside a latex block?  It looks like
hypextra does what you propose, but it is incapable of placing </latex>
inside a latex block.

If we can think of nothing better, I would accept enclosing
latex-in-html with <latex> tags.  However I think a better idea would be
<equation> and <axiom> tags.

Okay.  ;)  Well, let's see how much I've gotten done when you get back.

P.S. this message will hose ZWiki and LatexWiki because it contains
mock-tags.  I propose also that mail-in messages be stx *without* html.
This is required anyway if we mark-up message quoting with '>'.  i.e. if
the mime-type of the message is text/plain we treat it as text/stx
(since no mailer will generate text/stx).  Alternatively if the email
contains mime multipart/alternative with an HTML section, we can use
that directly.  This points toward comments being independent documents
of the parent -- and each comment could have a different pagetype!

I do understand now that it is indeed a major effort. In fact, I was quite
astonished about your approach: I would have added a "pamphlet" style that
accepts pamphlet files only, generates the latex via the document command, then
the html via l2h or latex2html or hevea or whatever. (hevea would be an
especially nice option: the pictures take a long time to load)

So, in short, I think that Bob's approach is the one to go. By the way: also
the dollar-sign poses problems in StructuredText+LaTeX and has to be escaped in
single-quoted text...

What's stx?

I would like to have another pagestyle: 

       o pamphlet, which is passed through document, then latex2html or
       whatever. Note that it is important that pamphlet file writers cannot
       use StructuredText stuff or WikiLinks: The pamphlet files need to
       generate standalone dvi, ps and pdf, too. Thus, an author who wishes to
       refer to other files should use hyperref! I suspect that hyperref and
       latex2html work together nicely.

I don't see any point in mixing html and latex.

Ah I didn't know that. So, if you must, you can.

Thanks again for all your work! I suspect that without you the Axiom community
wouldn't be anywhere close to to where it is now!

Martin

But that *is* almost what I am doing. What you call 'document'
is just noweave with a couple of Axiom specific options. l2h
is called as a filter from inside noweave to do the html
conversion. But l2h does not do a reasonable job of converting
equations to html. So what I decided was to use those features
of LatexWiki that already do essentially just this part of the
LaTeX conversion alone. The output of my modified l2h filter is
just the HTML+Latex format of LatexWiki.

It is true that the LaTeX generated images take a comparatively
long time to load. But most people seem to think that hevea
does a pretty awful job of converting LaTeX equations to HTML.
The fact that it (sort of) does it at all is a kind of miracle
since HTML was not designed to display mathematics. That is
the function of the mathML extension of the language. The *best*
why would be to convert LaTeX equations to mathML. But mathML
is still not supported widely and might not really be identical
to the LaTeX generated result that everyone expects.

I agree in the long run. But it will take some time to get
there and then to add the Axiom and Reduce functionality etc.
Another few days of my time (when I get time) will probably
be all that is needed to get the current approach working.

Yes. But not such special escaping will be required in
the pamphlet files themselves - it is only necessary
internally between the l2h filter and the LatexWiki
HTML+Latex format.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yes, I know, but I keep confusing the four possibilities in

Well, but wouldn't it be easy to forget about the equations for a start? It
would be useable, wouldn't it. Making it pretty would be nice, but maybe that
can wait?

Yes, but with the pictures I simply cannot use it from my home computer... So
I'd prefer to have both possibilities :-)

Why?  Too slow?

To answer another question: stx is a simplified wiki-like markup
suitable for wikis and adding latex to email communications.  It is what
latexwiki is built around.

I'm going as fast as I can but this is a large, and necessary rewrite.
I have my first iteration of this new code working::

    http://mcelrath.org:9675/newstx/

and it's available in my darcs repository::

    http://bob.mcelrath.org/darcs/zwiki-testing

This defines a new page type "Structured Text 2" upon which the new
"Structured Text + LaTeX" will be based.

I gather you guys just want to use my equation rendering though, right?
I'd be happy to separate that out to make it more useful to you.  Also
if you need assistance creating all these pagetypes, I'd be happy to
advise...

X-List-Received-Date: Wed, 13 Oct 2004 20:04:14 -0000

With the help of Camm and Michael I have finally succeeded
in building Axiom on Zaurus! Needless to say, it actually
turned out to be really much easier than the path I took.

The problem in the end was just MEMORY - swap memory to
be specific. I considered the options to use nfs or an
external usb disk drive, but in the end I decided just to
put the swap on a compact flash card. This was something
that was not highly recommended in the Zaurus forums, but
it is working great for me.

So what I have is this:

  Zaurus SL-6000
    (the older ZL-5600 would also probably work)
  1 Gbyte. SD memory card
  256 Mbyte Ultra II CF memory card

The Ultra II is a new faster (10 Mbyte/sec) version of CF
that also uses less power.

If you think that a Gbyte is more than enough beware that
what you want to do with this machine will probably change
as you learn more about it. Larger SD and CF cards are
already available. By Christmas 2 Gbyte SD and 4 Gbyte CF
ultra cards might well be available for what I paid for
the above.

Debian and the entire development environment is on the
SD card and nearly fills it. 128 Mbyte of the CF card is
dedicated to swap space. But that is considerable overkill
since the swap space never exceeded about 15 Mbytes during
the build even though I was periodically using other programs
simultaneously on the Zaurus.

The CF card is by default (off-the-shelf) formatted as
a VFAT partition (Windows compatible). I know that unix
people would probably advise reformatting it as an ext2
unix file system. I had to use ext2 on the SD card for
debian itself. But, pleasant surprize, running a swap
file on VFAT seems to work. If it is more inefficient than
ext2, then I can't really tell because CF is pretty slow
anyway. I created the swap file with the command

      dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/cf/swap.img bs=1M count=128
      mkswap /mnt/cf/swap.img

The commands that I added to the unix rc5.d startup just
does 

      swapon /mnt/cf/swap.img

The only changes that I made to the Axiom build was to
use --endable-locbfd and --enable-holepage=4*1024 in the
initial GCL build. Then actually allows GCL to fit within
the available real memory of the Zaurus without swapping.
I cannot really say how much this small hole size affected
the build time but I think that because swapping to CF is
likely to be considerably slower than garbage collection
in ram, I think this is probably a good compromise.
Overall I would say that the total build time was probably
about twice as long as it was the first time I ever built
Axiom which was on a 266 MHz pc.

Anyway, none of this re-building was really necessary! All
that was needed was just to add a little swap space. Now
the debian arm binary runs fine. All I had to do was

  apt-get install gcl

and it works! The same is true of Axiom

  apt-get install axiom

Wonderful (of course it took me four days to get to say
that  :) ...

Perhaps it is good to know that *if* one really needed too,
it would be possible to re-build Axiom stand alone on the
Zaurus. Actually with swap space allocated, it runs quite
well in the background and does not interfere (much) with
the PDA functions (email, calendar, etc.) of the normal
Zaurus desktop. All you need is patience and a power supply.

A have to say again that I am really impressed by the
Zaurus SL-6000. It has taken me a few months to realize
that it really is like having a Linux desktop workstation
in your pocket.

  http://pocketworkstation.org

It even comes with a X-window system that lets you run
all X apps locally and/or from an external PC using VNC
via wireless or usb connection. It's fast. There is a nice
minimal windowing system called 'iceWM' but if you are
really crazy nothing would stop you from added KDE or
GNOME. Simply amazing (and terribly addictive if you have
any geek tendencies at all).

Hi Bill! Great -- good to hear the good news!  Now you've got me
wanting a zaurus ....

Take care,

I'm shocked.  Are you sure the patch is applied?  Please give me gcc
-v, cpp -I../h main.c, and (perhaps) access to the machine.

Take care,

Camm,

Mea Culpa. The patch was applied but then I did a make clean (by force
of habit) which removed the patched file. I've added the official patch
to the build and it's building smoothly now. Once the axiom build completes
and passes tests here I'll add the patch to the axiom cvs.

Thanks for the quick responses.

Tim

There is an interesting book on identities containing algorithms.
Apparently you can download the entire book for free.
The algorithms are written for Mathematica and Maple but not Axiom.

Check it out:

Greetings!

Downloaded this and gave it a quick look.  Might be an interesting
entry point into learning about extending axiom to translate this into
spad.  Should time for this arise, what would be the most useful way

Take care,

It depends a little on your goals.

1. you can translate any given algorithm into a spad package.

2. you could learn more about all this stuff by looking at the work of the
   people at RISC, especially Carsten Schneiders

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/combinat/publications/#cschneid

and Axel Rieses

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/combinat/publications/#ariese

and Markus Schorn

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/research/combinat/publications/#mschorn

and ...

(difficult)

3. You might simply ask those people (maybe Peter Paule is appropriate) what
   makes sense. Maybe somebody there volunteers to do some work.

4. if you are more interested in providing a framework within Axiom for all
this stuff, you might want to look at 

http://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=9217

The files involved are combfunc.spad and sum.spad, the latter implements
Gospers Algorithm.

There are certainly other useful possibilities.

Martin,

>what's the state of numerical integration? Is there any chance to resurrect
>this any time soon?

the numerical algorthms library used to be the NAG library.
if you have the NAG library then all that is needed is for me to
finish the sman (superman) implementation. sman manages socket
connections between processes. the current implementation uses
XDR format streams between the main axiom process and the NAG libs.

if you don't have the NAG libraries then we fall back on the open
source version. i've done some work on this with the lowest level
stuff. the plan is to work toward packages like Octave but it will
take a while.

Camm,

Well, first thought is to try to figure out Zielberger's algorithm.
This seems to be the most complete. Axiom already implements Gosper's
algorithm so a useful place to start is to see what was done in that
instance and try to implement something similar.

I've been working my way thru the first few chapters which has required
a lot of background reading on my part because I'm not really up-to-speed
on the various identities. it's been educational but so far has produced
no code from me.

Ideally you'd work on the algorithm as a literate program and I could
learn what you did from the document. But that's only my measure of
a useful way to proceed. Your path may vary :-)

Dear Camm,

Regarding the organisation of the summation algorithms: There are currently two
different ways summation algos are called: The package SUMFS FunctionSpaceSum
looks whether Gosper's algo is applicable, if yes, tries it, and if Gosper
succeeds returns the reult. If Gosper is not applicable or fails -- the latter
is the case for sum(1/k,k=0..n) for example -- it falls back to summation$COMBF
which returns
%defsum[summands,dummy_variable,summation_variable,lower_bound,upper_bound].

SUMFS sits in Layer 20, however, I don't know whether this is too interesting.

The package SUMRF RationalFunctionSum (Layer 14, for what its worth) invokes
Gosper for rational functions. (SUMFS does some normalizing first)

The second way summation can be invoked is through the operators %defsum (for
definite summations) and summation (for indefinite summations - no % here...)

The lines 

    evaluate(opsum, isum)
    evaluate(opdsum, iidsum)

in COMBF tell Axiom to use isum$COMBF and iidsum$COMBF to evaluate these
operators. I.e., when Axiom is told to evaluate such an operator, it goes
there. However, in this case, it does not check whether it could apply
Gosper...

The only thing iidsum does is to check whether the bounds are numbers or
not. If yes, it adds the summands, otherwise it calls idsum.

The statements in COMBF

    idsum l ==
      member?(retract(second l)@SE, variables first l) =>
        kernel(opdsum, l)
      first(l) * (fourth rest l - fourth l + 1)

check whether the summands actually contain the summation variable. If yes, the
operator %defsum (opdsum is a variable containing %defsum) is wrapped into a
"kernel", which prevents it from being evaluated again. Otherwise, the obvious
formula applies.

So, the problem occurs if I have an operator %defsum applied to some summand,
but the summand is changed via eval or subst for example. In this case,
sum$SUMFS won't be called, since Axiom doesn't see a function but an
operator. Instead, iidsum will be called -- since the evaluate line tells Axiom
so...

I don't think that this is horribly difficult to fix, but there should be a
clear design, leaving the possibility to integrate other summation algos.


-----------------

A second remark: Note that Zeilbergers Algo does not return a "closed form"
for the sum. It returns a reccurence relation. At the moment, there is no
notion for such a thing in Axiom. For my guessing package (which will return
reccurence relation at times, too), I simply defined an operator

       oprecur := operator("rootof"::Symbol)$CommonOperators

which works for the moment. If somebody is interested, he should think about
programming a recurrence solver...


Have fun,


Martin

The Aldor (external C-based compiler) and the Spad (internal lisp compiler)
accept approximately the same language except that Aldor wants trailing
semi-colons and has some extensions/modifications for dealing with the
fact that it has to run standalone.

The BNF in the book or at the aldor.org site should be nearly correct
for the Spad compiler.

As for the semi-colons in Aldor...
For compatibility reasons Aldor has the #pile directive. Try

aldor -fx -laldor xxx.as
xxx

with the attached program. In my case it compiles and prints 8.

Nevertheless, I would not suggest the #pile mode.

I simply don't like it. When I once programmed in Axiom I was always
confused about how much I have to indent a line so that the scope is
right. I was so happy to learn that Aldor's native mode is more C-like.
Unfortunately, I cannot reproduce some of the problems that made me wish
to have some more syntax than just indentation to specify the scope.

And I never felt that adding braces and semicolons is so much pain.

And maybe some day the Aldor compiler might not support #pile mode anymore.

By the way, are there already any results about distributing the Aldor
compiler with Axiom?

And may I ask back why you are (or why you are not) in favour of SPAD's
#pile mode? One can have a nice indentation also with the braces and
semicolons.

As a matter of style and personal preference, I understand your
view but I don't sympathize. Because of my programming background,
my initial reaction was similar to yours but reading Axiom algebra
code and programming in Python has changed my mind.

As far as I can tell, Aldor supports both modes interchangeably.
If you include braces and semicolons in your code, then it
expects you to continue to do so. But if you omit them and use
standard indentation it is just as happy.

It is not so much that it is a "pain" to add such decorations
but rather that it tends to obscure the structure of the program
and permits a layout style that is too flexible. I think properly
and consistently indented code (as required by SPAD) is easier
to read than most C-like coding styles.

That seems to be a choice over which we might have some
influence.

As far as I know, none. :(

Using indentation that is syntactically checked by the compiler,
results in a minimal, natural and more expressive 2-d layout
instead of a 1-d serialization that might be (slightly) more
convenient to the compiler. Yes of course I agree that indentation
as a form of "commenting" is not inconsistent with this 1-d
serialization, but in programming language design I am inclined
to favour the dogmatic, rather than permissiveness, for the sake
of consistency and precision.

Since we use 2-d computer displays and all of the editors in
common use respect such 2-d formatting, why not use it in an
essential way in the programming language? Extra braces,
parenthesis, begin-end, do-od, if-fi, and ; at the end of a
statement, etc. now just seems ugly and unnecessary to me. 

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I did run into an example:

Consider two nested if statements, where one else branch is missing:

         if cond1 then
           if cond2 then
               bla
               bla
           else
             bla
             bla

versus

         if cond1 then
           if cond2 then
               bla
               bla
         else
           bla
           bla

It only discovered it by luck.

Martin

PS: is there any progress on using the Aldor compiler for compiling domains
that use other Axiom domains?

Of what is this an example? It just seems like two
reasonable examples of indented coding to me.

(I added 1, 2, 3, 4 to bla to be specific.)

In the first case bla1 and bla2 execute if both cond1
and cond2 are true. bla3 and bla4 execute if cond1 is
true and cond2 is false.

In the second case bla1 and bla2 execute if both cond1
and cond2 are true (same as first case) but now bla3 and
bla4 execute if cond1 is false, independent of cond2.
This is clear because the 'else' block has the same
indentation as the first 'if' block. No?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi Bill!

here is the real life thing:

                    if degree g.factor = 1 then
                      a1v := -coefficient(g.factor, 0)

              else
                a1v := kernel(opalg, [poly2expr(xx, f.factor), xx::EXPRR])

If you are not careful, the 2 spaces of indentation are easily overlooked...
Of course, your analysis is correct. My point is only, that with braces or
parenthesis or whatever, this mistake wouldn't happen, not to me at least,
since it was clear to me where the else branch should belong, but I simply
missed the indentation. (I think, one if branch was added later, so I had to
reindent the whole thing)

But certainly, this is highly subjective, and therefore it is a real good thing
that you can choose piles or no piles.

Martin,

>From code you show below I would say that the problem is not
the placement of the 'else' block but rather the scope of the
'for' block. The second ("versus") part is very likely wrong
because of the reference to index variable g outside the for
loop. Also there is a minor formating error in the second part
because the 'else' block does not have the same indentation as
any preceeding 'if' block. Does the compiler actually compile
the second part without issuing an error?

I am completely sceptical that adding braces would make this
code any more clear or to help locate problems in the algorithm.

Code structure highlighting or folding of indented sections=20
such as found in some Python integrated development environments,
e.g. PythonWin, or see

  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-pide/
  http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-cpyide/

might help to make the structure of the program more readily
apparent. I wonder if anyone has ever done a good emacs mode for
SPAD "pile" highlighting and editing?

You write: "it is a real good thing that you can choose piles
or no piles". On the other hand in the previous message I rather
directly implied that this was a "bad thing". I think having
two different syntaxes for the same language is undesirable.
In my opinion in both programming and in mathematics adopting a
good (efficient, concise, standard, ...) notation is often more
than half the battle.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear Bill,

your analysis is of course correct, my only point being, that *I* just don't
*see* the correct amount of indentation. And yes, the first part is correct and
as I made up the second part, I mis-indented the if, so given this snippet, the
compiler would complain (yes, it would). On the other hand, the reference to g
was not there when I discovered the bug, so both snippets were completely
legal.

An emacs mode for editing piled code would be great and should go on the
WishList.

Since we are most unlikely to agree on a "good" style of coding (there are
simply too many very different mathematician-programmers around, some of them
come from a C backgound, some of them like Lisp, others Phython, I know some
who do their stuff in ML) I maintain that it's a good thing to have two possible
syntaxes to choose from.

Personally I'd favour compatibility with Aldor usage, in order to enlarge the
community.

Regarding the original (BNF) discussion: Note that Aldor has some new concepts,
like extend. Furthermore, it seems to me, that in Aldor you can define domains,
categories and functions in places where the Axiom compiler would complain.

Martin

Camm,

Attached is a portion of the console from today. I spent the day trying
to port Axiom to an apple MAC G5 box. I've applied a few of the changes
to the axiom sources but eventually got this failure.

It appears that 
checking host system type... powerpc-apple-darwin7.5.0
is unrecognized. 

What can I do, if anything, to fix this? Does gcl run on a G5 MAC?

Tim

Tim,

I ain't got a MAC ... but I did notice the message:

> Exactly one loader option must be chosen: dlopen=no statsysbfd=yes
> dynsysbfd=no locbfd=yes custreloc=no

in your console output. Does it make sense that you might be
trying to specify both statsysbfd=yes and locbfd=yes? Or perhaps
this is happening by some incorrect default behaviour.

Bill.

Greetings!  This is odd, as the pattern in configure is
powerpc-*-darwin*.  In any case, I think you want --disable-statsysbfd
--enable-locbfd --enable-machine=powerpc-macosx.

Please keep us posted.

Take care,

David,

I've moved the Axiom homepage pointer on savannah to point to
http://axiom.axiom-developer.org to allow for easier and more frequent
updates. I'm also in the process of updating the pages to conform to
the current reality.

In the process I've reformatted and rewritten the pages to conform to
the style of the CAISS institute (where I work http://www.caissny.org).  
We're working on a second open-source math program called Magnus which 
will eventually work in conjunction with Axiom and we're merging the styles.

The download site has also moved to axiom-developer.org (which is a
machine I personally pay for somewhere on the web). This will give us
better control over file downloads, which will also be brought up to
date over the next few days.

Hope you don't mind the fact that I stepped on your work but I'm
under a bit of pressure here to bring things up to date. My actions
are not intended as a criticism of your contributions, which I greatly
appreciate.

Tim

No worry. I haven't been much active on Axiom recently. And regarding
downloads, the download area of savannah is quite difficult to use, so
it is a good idea to move somewhere else.

I'm still hopping to do something useful on Axiom.

Yours,
d.

Dear Bill, David, Tim, *,

the move is OK to me, here are some random comments of various (unordered!)
levels of significance:

* www.axiom-developer.org currently redirects to page.axiom-developer.org. I
  think it would be better to have it point to axiom.axiom-developer.org. One
  is more likely to remember www.axiom-developer.org than
  axiom.axiom-developer.org

* The wiki link on axiom.axiom-developer.org leads to
  page.axiom-developer.org. I think it would be wiser to make
  page.axiom-developer.org/zope/mathaction/FrontPage the main wiki site. To me,
  the material on page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone is highly unorganized,
  confusing and not inviting. Is there material on Plone that is missing on the
  mathaction site? If yes, please provide pointers. I volunteer to move it.
  (Please!)

* the new homepage states that CAISS is supporting Axiom now. In what sense?
  This looks like great news!

* Bill, you added two links to Tutorials to the FrontPage. May I move them to
  the Axiom Documentation page? I have the feeling that they really belong
  there and that it scatters the FrontPage a little -- it doesn't fit on one
  screenfull anymore now... Do you think that 
  "Axiom documentation and community" 
  is misleading, i.e. that you wouldn't look there, if you are looking for a
  tutorial? If this is the case, maybe we should rename it to
  "Axiom tutorials, documentation and community"

Martin

I agree and have changed the redirect to point to
  axiom.axiom-developer.org

I think a direct link to MathAction is a good idea, BUT
I also think /zope/mathaction needs a more prominent link
to /zope/Plone (Axiom Portal).

Yes there are some documents on /zope/Plone that are not
on /zope/mathaction but I am not sure if they belong on
MathAction or not. There are things that Plone does that
the ZWiki software on MathAction can not do such as private
user files and controlled publication, calendar events,
bibliographies etc. There may also be some material on the
test.axiom-developer.org test site that is not on MathAction.

In principle, MathAction is the less controlled environment
because it is an open publicly accessible wiki. In fact, it
is more organized only because Martin has done a great job of
maintaining the content. The Plone Axiom Portal on the other
hand has not had nearly enough attention. I just don't have
enough time to spend on making things look nicer or even
necessarily configuring things to be most efficient. Plone
is very highly configurable. What we have right now on the
Axiom Portal is almost "straight out of the box". If anyone
has the time and is motivated to make the Axiom Portal site
look and work better I would be very happy to provide the
"technical support" - content however is not my strong point.

>

> In what sense? This looks like great news!

I also like Tim Daly's plans for soliciting additional
support and sponsorship from other sources. I think we
should include on this list other major commercial developers
of computer algebra software such as MapleSoft and Mathematica.
I don't see any conflict with asking for their support. After all
both Maple and Mathematica have benefited a great deal from the
pioneering efforts by the Axiom developers.

Screen size is relative :) but I do think that such tutorials
should be VERY easily accessible - more or less right up front.
I expect that many people arrive at MathAction with little or
no knowledge of what Axiom really is. Navigating to a 2nd page
might be a (minor) inconvenience. Of course it is a matter of
preference but generally I do like to have more information
on the first page I see, not less.

I suggest using just the name "Axiom tutorials and documentation".
The "community" part of it is (mostly) irrelevant. Elsewhere
perhaps we might want to have a page that says "Who's who in
the Axiom community" and list some of the community information
there.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I think that concentrating on MathAction would be a good idea, since our
community is pretty small, however:

I propose the following: I integrate into MathAction those things I can move to
MathAction (Please provide pointers). As soon as the need arises, we integrate
MathAction into Plone.

Although MathAction is less controlled, please notice that there is very little
action on MathAction... So, control is not an issue currently.

Thanks.

I do not have the time of maintaining the content of two sites. And -- sorry,
Bill -- I'm quite certain that it would not be a good idea to somehow split the
content. PLEASE: Let's go with MathAction for a while. It provides -- nearly
:-) -- everything we need right now!

I see your point. However, it seems that you agree to

Please send an OK!, than I'll do this.

That's an option of course. I'll spend a few minutes on thinking how to
reorganize the material on the Documentation page, OK?

Martin

                    (: OK! :)

Please continue to feel completely free to change the
content on MathAction however you wish. It is an open
and unrestricted place where anyone who cares to can
make whatever changes they want (except deleting pages).
I think your views on how to structure the material in
MathAction are very good.

The kind of "control" that I am concerned about on the
Axiom Portal (Plone) is the really best viewed as "privacy".
Perhaps one of the reasons that we see so little activity
on MathAction - in spite of the fact that everyone who has
seen it has praised it's apparently valuable features - is
that some potential users view it as *too public*. Many
people do not like to experiment in such an environment.
And in the end, a lot of people deprecate their own ability
to contribute useful material for others.

There are now about 30 people registered to use the Axiom
Portal. Some of them have apparently been experimenting on
their own in a less public manner. With Plone

  http://page.axiom-developer.org/zope/Plone

you can access Axiom and Reduce online via the web without
the feeling that everyone is watching what you are doing.
After you develop something that you would like to share
with others, then you can submit it for "Publication".
Then other users of the Axiom Portal will be able to see
and comment on the work.

While on the subject of the "action on MathAction" and
promoting it's use I should mention that I have submitted
the MathAction site to

  http://mathforum.org

however I have not yet heard back from them about adding
it to their quite extensive list of math resources.

I have also recently posted a message about MathAction at

  http://mathforge.net

Description: A set of freely available online mathematics
tools that include a community message board for math-related
news and user-initiated discussions, dynamic non-Java-based
MathML rendering capabilities (try them out and save your
changes in a Wiki), computer maths tools, and Web publishing.
The private message board allows users to form task-related
groups. User registration is required for some of the services.
Mathforge aims to be capable of numerical and symbolic calculation,
publishing documents with mathematical content, analyzing and
visualizing data, and much more.

I recommend using the Search function, the What's New link
and the Recent Items box to see what there.

I am happy to continue to use both since (for me) they
server rather different purposes.

Related to the above, here is a link to a wiki page in the
"Sample Group" on the http://mathforge.net website.  Note that
(like LatexWiki) it allows mathematics to be displayed in a
MathML-capable browser.

I wonder if mathforge would be interested in the Axiom

Thanks!

This is interesting but it looks like a very restricted subset of latex
syntax.

I currently use itex2mml for the MathML in LatexWiki, which is also a
restricted subset of latex.  (in fact, I would like to see an
enumeration of exactly what the restriction is...)  It looks like
ascii2math is more restrictive in its syntax than itex2mml...

I haven't made a lot of noise about mathml in latexwiki because of this
unknown restriction, but it does work...

Currently,

redirects to 

http://axiom.axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/download.html

This is nonsense, because that way you never get to the files :-(

About a month ago I (finally) managed to figure out how
to put files in the savannah files section again - the
procedure to do this changed last year after the hacker
attack on savannah and the files that we preiously had there
were removed by savannah. The method to upload files now
involves signing them using gnupg - not so hard but not
trivial. Anyway, we did not have any files there for a long
time until just last month.

Whatever Tim Daly did in order to change the default home
page has also apparently changed the savannah files link.
Since I don't really understand how this home page re-direct
thing works at savannah, I don't know how to correct this.

Tim, what do you think? Is there an easy way to fix this?
If we store the files somewhere else and link directly to
them via the download.html page, how can we transfer what
we already have at savannah to the new location? Since
the Axiom Portal software on page.axiom-developer.org has
a simple file upload/download feature, maybe we should
locate all such files there.
