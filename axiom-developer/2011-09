It occurs to me that I didn't fully answer your question about
the complete graph information. 

The complete graph is VERY complex and I could not find a way
to visualize the whole thing. I'm getting better at HTML5,
Javascript, and CSS so I may eventually figure out a good way.

In any case, the complete dependence graph information is 
available in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet. The layerpic
chunks have all of the edges listed although mostly as
comments. Only the "supporting edge" is not commented.

To construct a "supporting edge" you need to find out every
dependence and then find the one in the highest layer. This
forces a new domain to be one layer higher and is the edge
that supports the new domain. So everything in layer 14
depends on something in layer 13 and nothing in or above
layer 14.

Adding new algebra involves finding the supporting edge.
I have written some code for this but it is not very robust
so it is not part of the system.

If you really want to construct the "FULL" graph you can use
the dot information in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet. All you
need to do is uncomment the dot commands in the layerpic chunks.

Hi, axiom-developers,

I'm new to axiom and just getting aquainted to it, trying to solve my
problems using it, so please, forgive me, if I ask questions with obvious
answers.

The one thing, which confused me is what do diagrams in bookvol10.3 (Domains
reference) mean.

The first question is what is the legend? It seems to me, that green boxes
are domains and blue ones are categories. But there are some other colors
and shapes. What do they mean? Is some kind of legend given anywhere?

The sencod question is what kind of relation is depicted on those diagrams?
E.g. for the category Symbol we have diagram with arrow pointing to STRICAT
(StringCategory) category. But if I look at the code bellow (in the same
section of the bookvol10.3) or browse documentation of the Symbol in the
HyperDoc, I cannot find any reference to StringCategory. So, what is the
relation, depicted in the diagram in the bookvol 10.3? (Note: similar
situation presents for other domains eiher).

Thanks in advance,
Dmitry Semikin.

>     Page 1?

Actually, page 1 seems to suggest that the diagrams have nothing to do 
with inheritance but rather with build dependency (read the first 
paragraph).

> By the way, are those diagrams generated automatically, or they are
> hand-made?

I'm not sure, but 
https://github.com/daly/axiom/blob/master/books/ps/v103symbol.ps 
suggests that they are "pre-made" and stored in the version control 
system. Tim can probably tell you more truth here.

In what are you actually interested in? Pose your problem and maybe 
there is someone who can help you. Reading all the details of the 
implementation is probably not something a newcomer should do. It's well 
known that Axiom has a very steep learning curve. There's no trivial 
route around it since the system *is* really complex.

Ralf

PS: If you want me to anwser further mails, you'd better keep CC'ing the 
mailing list.

May be, the bug is known, I did not found any public issue tracker (I mean
alive one). So, here it is:

AXIOM Computer Algebra System
Version: Axiom (July 2011)
Timestemp: Monday September 19, 2011 at 02:15:02

OS: Ubuntu 10.10 (running within VMWare Player under Windows XP)

1. In HyperDoc window click Browse
2. Type in: "CARTEN" into search line
3. Click "Constructors" bellow

Result: HyperDoc window is closed, the following line is printed out in
console:
>> System error:
The function MAKE-INPUT-FILENAME is undefined.


After that typing ")hd" into the console brings HyperDoc window, there is
warning string in the console:
binding UNIX server socket: Address already in use (HyperDoc) Warning: Not
conected to AXIOM server!

and Browse facility of Hyperdoc do not work.


Note: The same thing happens with other domains too (e.g. Integer). More
over, it looks, like HyperDoc crashes, when I try to access domain
descriptions. E. g. If I go to some Category description (it works), and
than use "Domains" link at the bottom, the result is the same.

Note: The same behaviour is observed in standard Ubuntu package AXIOM (there
earlier version of axiom is included).

Sorry, I cannot help here since I'm actually a FriCAS user (I don't have 
AXIOM installed) and in FriCAS I cannot reproduce this bug.

Ralf, thanks again.

Actually, page 1 seems to suggest that the diagrams have nothing to do with
> inheritance but rather with build dependency (read the first paragraph).


I see. I treated voluemes 10.2, 10.3, 10.4 as printed version of (extended)
library reference. But I see, that actually, it is much more, that it
includes either testcases and building process related information.

Now I see, that actually for reference HyperDoc is much better option, than
those volumes... But in my distribution for some reason HyperDoc do not show
reference information on domains (I've posted it to this mailing list with
other topic). I either did not find any HTML documentation, so I started to
look into PDFs. But there are only AXIOM-book, which is good tutorial, but
not reference. And those volumes...

Besides, in my opinion (it is only my opinion, but still it is opinion of
newcomer) HyperDoc documentaion is structured in non-standard fasion, which
makes it not so easy to use at the beginning. I mean the following thing:
when I look at other programming languages usually standard documentation
consists of the following parts:

1. Syntax reference (which is formal description of keywords and syntactic
costructs accepted by compiler or interpreter);
2. Standard library refererence, which lists and describes all packages,
classes, functions (in case of axiom - Domains, Categories, Packages and
operations).
3. Tutorial, which gives an overivew of standard facilities and pushes into
the language.

The very important thing, which must present in the beginning of any
tutorial (and overall documentaion) is how to get help for particular thing.
In axiom there are many things involved, such as )summary, )help, )what,
)hd, )describe, )show commands (by the way, not even all of them are listed
by )summary command). HyperDoc system - it pops up on start, so it is ok.
But it is structured in not so obvious way. Why AXIOM book is in Reference
secion? And why Reference->Language do not contain description of creation
of Domains, Packages and Categories? Where in reference compiler is
described? Why Examples anre in Reference section? etc... All those things
confuses for the first time significantly. Lack of formal syntax reference,
collected in one place is either makes learning harder.

Please, do not think, that I'm ungreatful man. Actually, I understand, that
great efforts was made to develop axiom system (and its help in particular).
I think, that axiom is really wonderfull (it is the only CAS I know, which
has strict typing and syntax similar to haskell... although I did not try
Reduce). I like it very much and I only hope, that things, that I've told
above will help make Axiom even better and easier for newcomers to adopt, so
more people will start working with it.

Sorry, all those things become off-topic, as initial post was about
diagrams...

By the way, are those diagrams generated automatically, or they are

I think, that it is enough truth for me at the moment. Thanks.

I already see it. The problem I'm solving can be formulated as following:
There is finite part of Taylor expansion of the Energy as function of one
vector and one tensor of sencod rank. If the expansion is taken up to the
4-th degrees on variables it already has about hundred of terms in it
(actually, I need expansion up to 6-th or 8-th degree). But the system has
some symmetries, so I should simplify this polynomial taking into account
the symmetries of underlying system.

Actually, at the moment for me the main issue is that axiom has too many
domains, categories and packages and I do not know what to start with.
(that's why I was wondering about diagrams, as I thought they could help me
to build hierarchies of Domains of categories - diagram given on the
axiom-developers.org is too big to be usable).

At the moment I think, that I will generate CartesianTensor(1, 3, Expression
Integer) of required rank, filled with symbols (named in spacial way, e.g.
a11 for the a[1,1]). And while generating those tensors I will imply
symmetries (actually, I'm not still sure how to do that, e.g., there are
some domains related to permutations, but looking at tham I cannot figure
out, if I can use them in my applicaiton). After tensors are generated, they
can be contracted and initial polynom (expression, coercible to polynom)
will be obtained. Than extract monomials (using Polynomial's operations with
monomials) one by one and check their sysmmetry properties.

If some one can give some hints about what can be used in solution of this
problem, I would really appreciate it.

PS: If you want me to anwser further mails, you'd better keep CC'ing the

Sorry, my fault.

It's not just your opinion. But there is currently not enough manpower 
to treat every aspect of this big system. And if you look at the 
sources, you'll find that they are written in hypertex, which is close 
to tex, but has some hyperlinking features. There is no browser version 
since someone would have to translate (or automatically convert) the 
hypertex sources into html. Furthermore some of the sources, in 
particular the API descriptions are written in the source code itself as 
++ comments. These are currently automatically extracted from the code 
and made available to HyperDoc.

As for help, there is probably currently only HyperDoc and some friendly 
developers on the mailing list(s). I almost never use the )show, )what 
etc. commands but do all with hyperdoc.

There are a few questions like "lack of formal syntax reference" that 
are not yet answered fully. Nobody has written a document about this (at 
least not to my knowledge). The closest thing you can find is the Aldor 
User Guide.

No problem. But the thing is, that even *you* can help. Posing such 
questions, suggesting improvements, etc. Be concrete, take your time and 
dig into the source code, ask other developers if you get stuck, provide 
patches. Axiom will not becoming better over night. More people are needed.

There are two quite usable diagrams in the original Axiom book by 
Jenks&Sutor. I don't however know whether these (smaller) hierarchies 
exist somewhere in the net.

Open up a sandbox on http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org, i.e. create, 
for example, the page 
http://axiom-wiki.newsynthesis.org/SandBoxTensorWithSymmetry and put 
your initial commands there. Perhaps, someone might help you in entering 
the right commands. Of course, you have to clearly describe you 
mathematical problem, i.e. what is input and what do you want to obtain 
in the end.

These diagrams are subgraphs of the whole "support lattice". 

Each domain requires a lot of other domains before it can be compiled.
If you create a lattice and place each domain in the lattice such that
everything it depends upon is below it you will find a "highest"
precondition domain. If you try to place Symbol in this lattice you 
will find that StringCategory is the "highest" required domain. 
This is a compile constraint, not an algebra constraint.

StringCategory is in layer 9 and will be compiled before anything in
layer 10 of the support graph. Symbol is in layer 10 because it 
depends upon StringCategory.

The complete support lattice is documented in the Makefile
(src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet). 

There is a complication in the case of SYMBOL and some other domains.

If the support lattice was a pure lattice then we could compile the
algebra from scratch. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The algebra
forms a graph. At the bottom of the lattice is a clique of files that
all depend on each other. These files have to be compiled before any
other files. So SYMBOL has to be compiled before STRCAT. But we just
figured out that STRCAT has to be compiled before SYMBOL. This is
called the "bootstrap set".

In the past Axiom always needed a running Axiom to compile the algebra.
Since a running Axiom already contained the algebra, SYMBOL and STRCAT
already existed. This was never a problem when I worked at IBM since
I always had a running Axiom available.

When I got the Axiom sources I was not given permission to distribute
a running Axiom from NAG. That means that you could not build Axiom
entirely from the source code. Since the whole point of an open source
project is that anyone can build it from source I needed to figure out
a way to build the algebra from scratch.

One of the most difficult tasks was to discover the support lattice,
find the "bootstrap set", and set up a "precompile phase" which compiled
the algebra from the lisp sources rather than the spad sources. Note
that spad is really just syntactic sugar over common lisp so this is
always possible. It turns out that there are 85 algebra files in the
bootstrap set (see LAYER0BOOTSTRAP in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet).
SYMBOL is a member of the bootstrap set.

So the process is:
 (LAYER0BOOTSTRAP) compile these algebra files from lisp sources
 (LAYER0 - LAYERn) compile these algebra files from spad
 (LAYER0COPY) recompile these algebra files from spad
this happens because of the ORDER variable
(see ORDER= in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet)

Once this bootstrap problem was solved I could build the rest of the
algebra lattice.

This is explained in the section "Adding new algebra" in 
src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet

The color and the shape carry the same information.
  #4488FF == category (bookvol10.2) box
  #88FF44 == domain   (bookvol10.3) ellipse
  #FF4488 == package  (bookvol10.4) circle
  #444488 == numeric  (bookvol10.5)

I apologize for the horrid choice of colors (I am partially color
blind). You'll notice that they are just rotations of the hex codes.

In the books (10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5) I have a chunk that enables
me to recreate the support lattice. The information for each 
domain includes the subgraph. The image is created from this
tiny specification and is a subgraph of the full graph.
(axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/bookvol10.2full.html)
(axiom-developer.org/axiom-website/bookvol10.2abb.html)
If you click on a node it will take you to the appropriate
book. I plan to make this link to the proper section of the
book but have not done that yet.

Actually, I do not draw the full graph. All of the full graph
information is documented in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet but
the actual graph is HUGE. You will see that most of the links
are comments. I have tried several different ways to make this
graph available. I wrote a few graphing tools to do tricks 
like force-based node expansion but I never published the results.

Ultimately I plan to make the graph have links to the domains
in the books. Those domains will have documentation of the theory
(some exist), the algebra (exists), the test cases (some exist), 
the help file (some exist), proofs (in plan but not published), etc.

All of this takes time and most of my time these days involve
treeshaking and documenting the interpreter and compiler.

The relationship in the support lattice is NOT the same as the
algebraic relationships. The support lattice documents the compile
time constraints.

I have a plan to document the algebraic support lattice but I have
not done it yet.

The algebra has been reorganized from hundreds of tiny files to a few
books. The 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, and 10.5 volumes contain the actual
algebra. Volume 10.1 will focus on explaining the algebra in a
more mathematical area approach (e.g. linear algebra) with uses and
explanations that are mathematical and have examples. There will
be hyperlinks to the appropriate Axiom domains in other volumes.

Needless to say, this takes time.

I have rewritten and reorganized the hyperdoc information into html
form and I have created a set of web pages that communicate to a 
running Axiom. This forms a notebook front end that will contain the
same information as hyperdoc. The new Axiom HTML browser lives in
Volume 11 (books/bookvol11.pamphlet). The Axiom browser allows you
to interact with Axiom through web pages.

That effort was put on hold while I learned more Javascript and AJAX.

Unfortunately, HTML5 came along and I have learned better ways to write
the pages using Javascript, CSS, and the Canvas element so I will end 
up redesigning the HTML. In particular, the Canvas element allows me 
to draw Axiom's graphics directly in web pages so I am looking at 
replacing the X11 graph subsystem (Volume 8) with interactive graphics.

I have now learned how to write apps for the iPad and Android devices
and am looking at ways to support the new front end on these devices.
Of course, I need to make the Axiom browser work on all devices so 
there are some things I need to think about and design. Some of the
animations I have written do not work on all browsers.

Ultimately, this is converging on the Crystal design (Volume 12).

Volume 0 and Volume 1 contain this information.

Oops. Thanks for the bug report. Fixed in the next release.

More documentation is being added. Help files are being written for
many more domains. The new )describe command shows the description
section for a category, domain, or package. For example:

(1) -> )describe DHMATRIX
4x4 Matrices for coordinate transformations
This package contains functions to create 4x4 matrices useful for
rotating and transforming coordinate systems. These matrices are
useful for graphics and robotics. (Reference: Robot Manipulators
Richard Paul MIT Press 1981)

 A Denavit-Hartenberg Matrix is a 4x4 Matrix of the form:
      nx ox ax px
      ny oy ay py
      nz oz az pz
      0 0 0 1
 
 (n, o, and a are the direction cosines)


The ")d op foo" command now shows examples of how
to use functions from domains. For example, the pop! function:

(1) -> )d op pop!

There are 4 exposed functions called pop! :
   [1] ArrayStack D1 -> D1 from ArrayStack D1 if D1 has SETCAT
   [2] Dequeue D1 -> D1 from Dequeue D1 if D1 has SETCAT
   [3] D -> D1 from D if D has SKAGG D1 and D1 has TYPE
   [4] Stack D1 -> D1 from Stack D1 if D1 has SETCAT

Examples of pop! from ArrayStack

a:ArrayStack INT:= arrayStack [1,2,3,4,5] 
pop! a 
a


Examples of pop! from Dequeue

a:Dequeue INT:= dequeue [1,2,3,4,5] 
pop! a 
a


Examples of pop! from StackAggregate

a:Stack INT:= stack [1,2,3,4,5] 
pop! a 
a


Examples of pop! from Stack

a:Stack INT:= stack [1,2,3,4,5] 
pop! a 
a

Hyperdoc was written in the 1980 prior to the idea of a browser or
the web. It was wildly far advanced for its time and still allows some
functionality you don't see in browsers. Most of the content was 
machine generated.

The Axiom book was written by the group under intense pressure to
have some kind of user documentation before we sold the system to NAG.
IBM intended to sell Axiom somehow but IBM sales required that all
documentation be written "to the eighth grade level" (age 12). They
had programs to check this constraint. Clearly Axiom was never going
to be an IBM product. 

At the time Hyperdoc was created we only had a few users worldwide
and almost all of them were using Axiom for research. They were also 
primary authors of the algebra so the "user documentation" was not
a priority. In fact, we often got algebra that we had to reverse
engineer because we had no documentation. People who program, and
in particular, people who program algebra, do not spend a lot of 
time and effort on the documentation. The best you tend to get are
"notes to self" kind of markup meaningful only to the author.

The open source version of Axiom has changed the focus and made
documentation be a primary goal. This is not shared by everyone 
and is one of the main reasons behind the forks of the project.

Literate programming is a great idea. The only hard part is the 
documentation.

Also at that time the syntax of the language was changing. There was
an effort to create a new compiler (A#, aka asharp) and there was a
great deal of debate about syntax and semantics. For a lot of reasons
I won't go into, the new compiler diverged from the Spad language.
This eventually was shipped as a separate compiler (Aldor) and has
since become moribund. Axiom has removed all support code for Aldor.

The information was collected by hand and is maintained with every new
change to the algebra. This isn't that big of an effort as adding new
algebra is a reasonably rare event and requires a lot of effort. We need
to know the information that the graph contains anyway so the graph is
really just a side-effect.

The "master" information is in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet

The information to create the subgraph in the books is kept with the
domain in the book. So Symbol (bookvol10.3.pamphlet) contains a chunk
<<SYMBOL.dotabb>> which is used to create the v103symbol.ps file using
the command "dot -Tps SYMBOL.dotabb >ps/v103symbol.ps"

Notice that the name "v103symbol.ps" means "volume 10.3 Symbol"

Actually, Axiom has a browser version (books/bookvol11.pamphlet)
It is being redesigned to use HTML5 rather than straight HTML.
