Lest you should feel like nothing is happening
great progress was made over this weekend.
None of it visible, of course, but progress nonetheless.

Tim, 

It sounds fascinating.  I'm delighted that Noweb might help enable
such an interesting and ambitious project.

Readers might be interested to know that Noweb supports documentation
in LaTeX, troff, HTML or plain text, so there is some flexibility on
the weaving side as well.

My opinion is that this would be easy to do using a Noweb filter.

For complex documents, we have wound up storing both `code' and `text'
in Noweb code chunks.  I have not explored clever ways of `weaving'
such documents.

Good luck!

I'm not at the point where I've had time to think about the details
of this yet but I'll look at filters (again). As you remember my
last attempt failed due to my lack of sed/awk/shell skills. This
time I'll try harder.

I've experimented with this. The problem is that chunking turns off
the TeX format mechanisms. This is the correct behavior for code but
not for the text. 

Further, I need two behaviors for text chunks. 

First, I need to be able to essentially \include a text chunk from
another document (or maybe a whole text root) into the current
document. This is to ensure that information that is widely needed is
not copied everywhere (otherwise some copies will be out of date).

I also need this ability in order to construct "booklets" without
copying the original sources but also without including the original
sources in total as \include would do. Think of a booklet as a thread
thru pamphlets with text along the threads. This will allow one to
write a chapter introduction, include some text and code chunks from
some pamphlet, and then write a summary or problems section (for a
textbook).

Second, I need to \cite a text chunk in a woven document. Then I
can cross-reference the documents so a reader mechanism can follow
the citations. This comes from pondering ideas of how to read the
.dvi files in some rational way. I'm tempted to automatically 
construct an html tree on top of the dvi files but I'm not happy
with this solution for the long term. The reader has to be more
intelligent and know about pamphlets, booklets and citations.

The current thought for a text chunk mechanism is, as you suggest,
to use the code chunking mechanism. That would make it simple to
understand for the user which is important. However, noweave would
have to get a whole lot smarter so it can reconstruct the document
from the chunks before trying to TeXify it. It also needs to
construct a bibliography environment (but with a different name)
so the \cite{chunk} mechanism works across pamphlets. Using this
information would be up to the reader program.

Obvious problems:

(1) copyright. 

This would be especially delicate when the text chunk produces source
that would be published, say, not within the open-source or Axiom
journal, but outside these.

(2) technical. 

There has to be some very restrictive convention on text chunks that is
TeX/LaTeX source (and similarly for other types of source that supports
any macros). For example, if within a text chunk, \renewcommand\xxx{...}
is allowed, then when other text chunks are assembled, the assembler
will need to be smart enough to save the the current definition of xxx
before getting into that chunk and restore it afterwards -- but this may
create problems too, because the original intention of the chunk author
may be that \renewcommand\xxx{...} has a larger scope than the text
chunk. The problem does not exist for the author, because the author
knows and presumably verify the assembled output. But when the text
chunk is \include(d) by other authors, it will be like calling a
subroutine with global variables reset as side-effect. Other commands
involving defining any macro are equally problematic.

One solution may be to limit the scope of macros local to the text
chunk, if the text chunk is intended for reuse. But how does the text
assembler know the previous environment without being the TeX compiler?
(Perhaps there is a TeX command to query the definitions of a particular
macro? I am no TeX/LaTeX expert, but as we will see, this facility will
be very useful. Let's call this the macroResolver for now. Such a
program is not too difficult to write for TeX gurus.)

How would code chunk assemblers solve this problem? In Axiom, we are
allowed to define macros (say, textual string substitutions with ==>,
not to mention the == ). So again we need an equivalent macrResolver.

Citation can presumably be done by creating a protocol that identifies
the location of the source. So the problem is defining what "location"
is, perhaps in a similar way to URL. But there is more. You are not
contemplating on just citing a DOCUMENT, but a TEXT CHUNK, that is the
equivalent of chapter and verse citation. So each citable text chunk
must have its own "URL" (let say we call it UCL, for chunk locator). If
you are using .dvi as the source (because you want to avoid compiling
the source again), you will need to embed the UCL info into the .dvi
source, which requires modifying TeX (not an elegant solution). The html
tree construct would work for entire DOCUMENT citation because the
entire .dvi file is retrieved and displayed. The user must then manually
scroll to find the right place. Not every .dvi (or .ps) viewer supports
searching. A .pdf version would be easier as far as the user goes since
(a) we don't have to maintain Acrobat Reader (b) it has good searching
facilities.

  However, this is not a good solution.

  Returning to the text chunk citation problem, it would seem that the
logical place for the booklet reader to obtain the information would be
the booklet/pamphlet source. Then the assemblers need to have an option
of outputing only the portion of the text chunk. This is probably
do-able. (For TeX, the assembler will have to create on the fly a TeX
source that can resolve all the user-created macros appearing in the
text chunk using the macroResolver. (As we see later, this is not
enough, we also need a labelResolver, and worst, a symbolResolver, but
let's ignore that for now). For code, a similar thing has to be done
when macros are used.) So a possible scenario is:

booklet 1:
...
(a)=some tag that identifies the type of chunk for that particular
assembler
... some chunk 
(b)=some tag that identifies that this is the beginning of a citable
portion
(c)=some tag that identifies an external name for this citable chunk,
say the name is BIBITEM
(d)=citable portion of chunk 
(e)= some tag that identifies that this is the end of a citable chunk
... more chunk
(f)=some tag that identifies the end of the chunk

booklet 2:
...
(z)=some tag that cites a chunk using BIBITEM
...

When the assembler (for the type of chunk) compiles booklet 1 the normal
way, it creates in a citation database an entry in the form of a pair
(BIBITEM, UCL). The UCL contains information on the name of the booklet,
the pamphlet containing the chunk, the type of chunk (a), and the tags
(b) and (c). The BIBITEM is published and used by other booklets for
citation.

When the assembler (for the type of chunk) compiles booklet 2 the normal
way, it outputs a citation in the form of [BIBITEM] say.

When a user wants to open this [BIBITEM] while reading booklet 2, and
say clicks on it, the booklet reader spawns a process that, in order,
 
(1) searches the citation database for the UCL corresponding to the
BIBITEM.

(2) finds out from the UCL the type of chunk BIBITEM is and invokes the
associated assembler by giving the source booklet file, pamplet, and the
tags (b), (c). The assembler resolves all the macros within the citable
portion using macroResolver, sends an abbreviated source that just
includes the citable chunk with all macros resolved to the TeX compiler
if the type is TeX, which outputs a .dvi and sends it to the booklet
reader for rendering (printer/screen). If the citable chunk is code,
then the abbreviated source can be sent to the booklet reader directly,
or to a code-formatter first.

The same mechanism may be used for references in TeX (this is not to be
confused with citations: a reference \ref{label} is a pointer to a
labeled location within the document, such as a Theorem, an equation,
section, etc; a citation \cite{bibitem} is a pointer to something
external to the document).  A labelResolver can resolve the references
easily using .aux, so a reference within a citable chunk can be compiled
correctly. It would be desirable and it is possible to add the
convenience to be able to jump to a labeled point in a pop-up window
(wouldn't that save us all the page turning back and forth?) if we treat
certain references (labeled items) as citable.  The processing of
citable chunks needs to be modified to handle labels external to, but
referenced within, the chunks.

But resolving the labels is only to maintain the same display as the
original document of the cited chunks. The definitions of symbols within
the cited chunks are not available, usually. (A symbol is any
mathematical symbol typset in math-mode). The same is true for a
referenced equation or theorem. Even if we can jump to the reference the
way a citation does by making it citable, the referenced or cited item
is not useful if the symbols are meaningless. This is probably the
hardest to resolve, for a TeX document, unlike a code source, the
symbols are not identified at all. There seems to be no way to write any
symbolResolver for TeX without revolutionizing the way math papers are
typeset.

So I leave you with an open problem, and readers of booklets will still
have to scroll and search manually the meaning of symbols. 

We can severely restrict how a citable chunk or reference can be written
-- they need be self-contained.

Well, first I've obtained permission for the various documents I'm
using (though motivated more by respect for the author than the legal
issue). Second, most of the quoted text will come from other pamphlets.
Third, publication outside of Axiom raises the issue of BSD licensing
of text of which I have no opinion as I've come to understand that Law
is at least as complex as programming and only experts should play.
Fourth, in the spirit of science it seems that the whole benefit is to
have others learn from and use your results. Fifth, copyrights haven't
been a huge benefit to the original authors (in my experience) as they
end up signing away those rights just to get published anyway. Sixth,
the subject is so complex that one can only depend on the cooperation
of the members of the community. Seventh, if some event DOES cause a
problem the only reasonable response is to withdraw the text and
apologize. Eighth, a large portion of this work is done by people
around the world so it raises the issue of international copyrights,
an even more arcane subject. Ninth, there seems to be great advantage
to having your Axiom-related research work distributed with Axiom and
that IS the point of publishing, right?

Unless we get a few lawyers on this mailing list who have qualified
opinions I don't see the point of discussing the legal issues. Yes,
I know it is important but without some authoritative opinion we're
just having "angels-on-pinheads" debates. I've read 4 books on the
subject of intellectual property, been advised by a lawyer over
intellectual property issues related to employment and read the
debates on open-free-proprietary. My only conclusion is that we have
to leave this subject to the people with law degrees.

So all I can suggest is: ask permission then proceed.

Yes, this would be a problem. However, you can change any of the 
pamphlets or booklets and submit the changes to CVS. Thus, it is
possible to dance around the issue by changing the referred-to
document to eliminate the problem. It does raise the issue of
"debugging" your document. sigh.

The process generates:
 
   pamphlet -> tex -> dvi

I expect that the "source" will be the pamphlet file.
In some instances it might need to be the tex file but we should
probably figure out clever ways to avoid this. The dvi file (or
ps or pdf or html or whatever final target gets chosen) is a
"compiled" form. However, TeXmacs could probably do some fancy 
things with almost any level assuming someone is willing to write
the code.

Hopefully the final "reader" (quite possibly TeXmacs or some other new
open source tool) will handle the problems you raise. I've been pondering
them for a while but don't have any grand insights to share. It's all in
the requirements-gathering phase, of which you've raised a few, at the
moment.

Mike,

The following files are never mentioned in the interp makefile
but live in the interp directory. Can you think of a one-liner
explanation of what they might be? I'm trying to figure out how
they should fit into the build. Are they autoloaded by some other
part of the system?

anna.boot 
construc.lisp 
domain.lisp
guess.boot
interp-fix.boot
nag-e02b.boot
nhyper.boot
pf2atree.boot
redefs.boot
word.boot

Thats for the ANNA (Axiom Numerical Analyst) hyperdoc interface which
requires the link to the NAG Library.

This is in the development/src/interp Makefile I sent you.

Not sure what this is - perhaps some early part of the Aldor

These files came from IBM and we never (as far as I know) used them.  I
think they were supposed to improve the browser interface by suggesting
correct spellings etc. of search terms.

This was a temporary patch to fix a problem with the way domain names
were printed - some bright spark thought running them through the
Fortran formatter to get 1-d output was a good idea!

This is one of the pages from the NAG hyperdoc interface.  If you read
the comment at the beginning of the file you'll see why its not in the
Makefile.

Not sure about this one - it may well have been a demo of how
TechExplorer could be used with the interpreter.

No idea - it does say in the comment it isn't hooked in yet.  It looks
like something that came from IBM.

> redefs.boot
This was needed to make the old system build properly since some
definitions were needed in multiple packages in boot.  When we moved to
CCL this file was removed from the system.

I hope that this is helpful.

Cheers, Mike.

Thanks.

construc.lisp is in the makefile but it is not required by anything so
it is never invoked. I'll look into it deeper.

With respect to the nag library, is there a way to test that I don't
break the interface? Is the library somewhere on the licensed version
you sent me? I don't plan to distribute it but it is in our mutual
interest to keep it functional so I'd like to test it.

Stephen,

Welcome back. I believe that Bill, Mike and myself are all 
interested in Aldor for various platforms, including Windows.
If you send the emails to axiom-developer@nongnu.org you will
end up copying all three of us. I clearly want help get Aldor
running everywhere also.

Greetings!  I thought this would be a good time for an update here, as
the acl2 work has basically been completed.  All these results pertain
to the current GCL cvs, released as Debian package version -70/rpm
version -71, and currently found for all platforms (with the exception
of Windows, which is slightly older) at

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gcl/cvs.

Debian packages for maxima and acl2 can be found at:

http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/m/maxima/

and at

http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/a/acl2/

I encourage those with knowledge pertaining to the ???? fields below
to offer their amendments.  Is there anything else being left out
here?  Specifically, I haven't heard from BSD in quite a while.

When axiom is released, we'll try to add it to this table too.  I'm
hoping that the automated process of producing binary packages on
these different machines as we continue to develop GCL will have the
dual effect of giving us early warning of any bugs we might introduce,
as well as provide incentive for end users to become interested in
Lisp. 

The results quoted below pertain to the latest officially released
versions of maxima and ACL2.  The results for maxima CVS are extremely
likely to be identical, based own my own tests on x86.

Take care,

(1) A few of the certifications currently fail because the image size
    is too large for the native 24bit relocations without additional
    trampoline code.  This should be fixed by the -mlongcalls option
    in forthcoming gcc-3.3, for which I think we should wait, unless
    anyone needs all the certs on acl2 ppc immediately.  Completing
    the ACL2 port turned up cache flushing corner case bugs in GCL.

(2) Build will complete in a few days -- result anticipated :-).
    Seriously, previous build succeeded in all steps before being
    killed by the autobuilder for taking too long to generate output.
    Completing the ACL2 port turned up cache flushing corner case bugs
    in GCL, and one SGC related bug.
    
(3) Provides an example of how the -mlong-calls enables big images
    like ACL2 on 24bit reloc machines like this.

(4) SGC recently enabled by s390 Linux kernel updates -- thanks
    Gerhard! 

(5) Maxima verified by me, acl2 shipped and certified by acl2
    upstream.

Bill,

I've gotten almost all of the files in interpsys compiled which
is most of the "heavy lifting". Do you have GCL running anywhere?

Great! I have been looking forward to doing something a little
more interesting...

> Do you have GCL running anywhere?
> 

Yes. I have GCL 2.4.4 compiled under Linux Red Hat 7.3
and the earlier version from the zip file binary distribution
on tenkan, of course. I also have GCL version 2.5 compiled
from source from the current GCL CVS) under MinGW and
running on native Windows. Earlier versions of GCL will
not compile directly under MinGW. However there are
earlier Cygwin versions. I would prefer to continue to
work with MinGW, however.

Recall also that I have CCL compiled from the tenkan
sources under Cygwin on windows. I have not been able
to compile this successfully under MinGW yet, but
the problems are minimal (I think). I haven't given it
any priority since you said that you were having trouble
with the Axiom code in this version and preferred to
work on it later.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I've checked in the next version of the system. This will build
from scratch the lisp, bootsys, and now depsys images. It will
compile but not build interpsys. I still have work to do to 
complete that phase. There should be 2 compile errors during
the build. I've included a console trace of the complete make
so you can compare your version for differences. I'm off from
work for the next two weeks (well, sort of) so I'll be "heads down"
on making progress on Axiom. In any case, could you check out this
version, try to build it and give me feedback? a console trace would
be useful.

A likely sources of trouble will be the gcl build. I'm afraid I
should have been more general about the gcldir stanza, which I
will fix in the next update. It currently hardcodes the gcl-2.4.1.tgz
tar file and should not. I'll promote that information to the platform
files.

If gcl-2.4.1 won't build and work for you then you can create a 
file called gcldir in the lsp subdirectory and the system will
not try to create the lisp. Then you can create your own copy of
the lisp by hand. The GCL build procedure makes the final lisp
image in the unixport subdirectory. It is called saved_gcl. You
can hand copy it to the obj/(platform)/bin subdirectory. Assuming
a linux platform you only need to type:

cd unixport
cp save_gcl obj/linux/bin/lisp

The build will now use that new lisp image as the platform for
compiles and saves.

The console trace: I've added annotations between sections so it doesn't
look like complete nonsense.

now we need to make depsys and interpsys
since these images share a large number of files they are built
in the same subdirectory at the same time.
note that this will build depsys but NOT interpsys as I still have
work to do to finish the task

Greetings, and thanks as always for your work on this!  Just wanted to
notice that there are quite a few straightforward failures when using
the latest GCL, due to the ansi IN-PACKAGE behavior (i.e. MAKE-PACKAGE
needs to be called first).

Please let me know if you ever change your mind, and would like a
compile or run time switch to get the old behavior.

Take care,

Camm,

Yes, I know about the IN-PACKAGE failures which will be fixed up shortly.
I'm still using gcl 2.4.1 for that very reason. I have several things
queued up to rewrite and this is one of them. At the moment I'm 
concentrating on getting one runnable version before I begin to add
my mista....changes.

If you modify the intermediate lisp files they will not get rebuilt.
You can add the make-package call to them and see if anything else
fails. Alternatively you could add a make-package into the lisp 
image and the compiles should work correctly.

I'm not caving into the runtime switch because I want Axiom to run on
both versions, the old common lisp and the new. GCL is only one of the
planned common lisp platforms so I couldn't depend on a compile-time
switch anyway.

Tim

I just got it to compute 2+2
It lives!

There are, of course, a pile of breakages that need to be fixed
and the build procedures need to be reworked but the heart of the
system is beginning to function. The plan is to have an alpha
release by year-end.

Congratulations!  An outstanding achievement!  And, BTW, everything
works with current GCL cvs if one does a few MAKE-PACKAGE commands in
the image first, as you suggested.

Take care,

re: current gcl 

I have to add a few things to the image to make Axiom work.
In particular, I add 2 files. This is easily done by adding
them to the EXTRAS shell variable in 386-linux.defs. However
the symbols they use get resolved from libspad.a. I know I
used have a way to add libspad.a to the raw_gcl loader line
but memory fails me about the "correct" path. Any suggestions?

Tim
