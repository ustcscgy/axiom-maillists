Axiom was originally developed at IBM Research under Dr. Richard
Jenks. The project went through several generations and had many
contributors. It was the one of the leading research projects at
the lab. Eventually IBM's fortunes changed and Axiom was sold to
the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG). For a while it was one of
"the big three" (along with Mathematica and Maple) commercial
systems.

In August of 2000 (August 11th, I believe) I had a conversation
with my son, Tim Daly Jr., who had called me to tell me that
Bill Schelter died.

I had worked with Bill on GCL (then called AKCL). Bill was under
contract to IBM to develop a lisp that would support Axiom. He
and I worked closely together on it. Bill not only built a lisp
to support Axiom but he worked to get a copy of Maxima as open
source.

I called Barry Trager, an IBM coworker and one of the fundamental
contributors to Axiom, to tell him about Bill. Barry told me that
NAG planned to remove Axiom from the commercial market.

I called NAG and they confirmed that they were going to stop
selling Axiom commercially. I asked them to release it as open
source and said that I would do what was necessary to make it
into freely available software.

NAG spent a considerable amount of time and effort to release
Axiom under the BSD license. They deserve a lot of credit for
ensuring that Axiom lives on. It took about a year to get the
CD containing the released sources. For various reasons there
were "missing parts" of the commercial version including the
techexplorer front-end, the numerics, and the Aldor compiler.

During that year there was a lot of debate about the goals
of Axiom. The open source version of Axiom was intended to be a
research platform, with no attempt to compete with commercial
offerings. Axiom's fundamental weakness as open source revolved
around the lack of deep documentation. The algorithms are hard,
the whole system internal structure was obscure, and the build
process was black magic. Some system internals were written in a
language nobody spoke. In order to correct these flaws the
focus was on completely rewriting the system, using literate
programming to provide a basis for integrating documentation
and code. Since Axiom is nearly a million "things of code" this
was expected to take a while (and is still ongoing 10 years later).

Axiom required a running copy of Axiom to build itself. But an
open source version could not assume the user already had Axiom.
So the fundamental problem was how to get around this circular issue.
This represented a major stumbling block that consumed a large portion
of the time from the CD release until the first open source
version "went live". The lattice of 1100 objects had to be
sorted, an inner clique of co-dependent objects had to be found,
and a method of building this clique and lattice needed to be
invented. Solving this problem took up most of the time from the
release. A second issue was that the commercial version ran on a
byte-coded interpreted lisp which I could not get to build. Axiom
moved back to AKCL (now GCL) with the help of Camm Maguire. All of
this work was supported by Dr. Gilbert Baumslag (CCNY).

Today Axiom consists of 20 books which contain a large portion
of the literate source code. There is an associated video and
more are planned. Axiom has been validated against two
major test suites and a third suite is in process. Axiom has
more tests, more documentation, a simplified build system, a
single lisp-based internal langage, new algebra, the beginnings
of a numerics library, and a firefox front end. It is freely
available on savannah (GNU), sourceforge, and github. It is
downloaded thousands of times per month. It is used by researchers
worldwide. Work still remains and "The 30 Year Horizon" doesn't
seem to be any closer but the progress is obvious.

Axiom is the work of these 226 people, over a lifespan of
nearly 40 years. The people who have contributed to it, as clearly
as we can determine, are listed here. Some of them have already
passed away, including Dr. Richard Jenks, the founding father of
Axiom. This makes it all the more important that we document the
work so the next generation can carry on to "The 30 Year Horizon".

Hello.

I've been reading a few things, as time allows, when it comes to my 
project of embedding Axiom into OCaml.

As far as I understand it, it seems to be better to bind a GCL 
interpreter (I do not know Lisp well, so feel free to correct), and 
access Axiom stuff from this interpreter. So I'm currently looking as to 
how this should be done.

But, on the other hand, The Axiom / Lisp 'interface' isn't so clear to 
me. I've been reading chapter 4, and specifically section entitled 
"Understanding a compiled function", which is the only place I've found 
low-level information. I've got a few questions on this topic:

-1- What is the purpose of the vmlisp.lisp.pamphlet file?

-2- It also seems that the commands

	)trace ONEP )break
	(trace (ONEP :entry (break))

are equivalent but that one is on the Axiom command prompt and that the 
other is on the Lisp command prompt. How do you access the Lisp command 
prompt

-3- Where is the source code of the /usr/lib/axiom-20100701/bin/AXIOMsys 
file (as installed by Debian)?

Thanks for clarifying these issues...

Best regards,

Guillaume Yziquel.

This is a possible path. It would be possible to grab the top level of the
lisp loop using pseudo-ttys (an expect-like interface). GCL is just a 
big C program
so you can add your own code to the GCL build.

"Axiom" used to be written in Maclisp (MIT), then was rewritten into VMLisp
(IBM Mainframe), and then I helped rewrite it into common lisp. Because of
the complexity of the system the vmlisp port was written by implementing the
maclisp primitives. Because of the complexity of the system the common lisp
port was written by implementing the maclisp and vmlisp primitives in 
common lisp.
These "foreign primitive implementations" live in vmlisp.lisp

The low-level information does not yet exist. The fundamental task of 
the Axiom
project has been, and continues to be, writing this kind of 
documentation. But
Axiom is about 1 million things of code and we are still in the phase of 
collecting
the code into a literate form so it can be documented.

They are equivalent.
You can access the lisp command line with
   )lisp ...some lisp s-expression...
as in
  )lisp (trace (onep :entry (break))

AXIOMsys is the whole interpreter/compiler/system. It consists of 
hundreds of files.
You can see the source from any release (they happen every 2 months) at:

I've been looking at ECL for embedding ECL into OCaml.

I'd really love to avoid pushing custom code into my GCL build if it=20
doesn't end up upstream. My hope would be to use things as packaged by=20
Debian, and therefore be able to repackage an OCaml-GCL binding.

I haven't looked at GCL very much yet, as ECL seems to be better suited=20
for bindings. I'll look into GCL source code for something like a C API=20
when I find the time for it.

Should I expect Axiom to run seemlessly under ECL?

Reading that, I'm wondering whether ECL is really an option. And even an=20
unmodified GCL doesn't seem to fit entirely the bill.

Would you welcome modifications in the source code allowing to expose a=20
C API? (I'm not committing to that, mind you...)

I do not have much against literate programming, but I must admit that=20
I'm having a tough time with a build system that I cannot easily find=20
nor understand.

OK. And where can I find the source code implementing the ')lisp' token?=20
That would be of great help.

I think I better rephrase my question: I'm looking for the main()=20
function for AXIOMsys. Could it be possible to pinpoint it in the source=20
code?

All the best,

Guillaume Yziquel.

The closest approximation is the Boot function 'restart' (or |restart| in LISP).

In OpenAxiom it is exactly systemMain (or |systemMain| in LISP.)

Note that in Axiom, the restart function name in not escaped
so you just invoke (restart), not (|restart|).

Scope:
~~~~~~

Lisp is one of the greatest ideas from computer science and a major
influence for almost all programming languages and for all
sufficiently complex software applications.

The International Lisp Conference is a forum for the discussion of
Lisp and, in particular, the design, implementation and application of
any of the Lisp dialects.  We encourage everyone interested in Lisp to
participate.

We invite high quality submissions in all areas involving Lisp
dialects and any other languages in the Lisp family, including, but
not limited to, ACL2, AutoLisp, Clojure, Common Lisp, ECMAScript,
Dylan, Emacs Lisp, ISLISP, Racket, Scheme, etc.

Topics may include any and all combinations of Lisp and:

 * Language design and implementation
 * Language critique
 * Language integration, inter-operation and deployment
 * Applications (especially commercial)
 * 'Pearls' (of wisdom)
 * Experience reports and case studies
 * Reflection, meta-object protocols, meta-programming
 * Domain-specific languages
 * Programming paradigms and environments
 * Parallel and distributed computing
 * Software evolution
 * Theorem proving
 * Scientific computing
 * Data mining
 * Semantic web

We also encourage submissions about known ideas as long as they are
presented in a new setting and/or in a highly elegant way.

Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic may communicate
by electronic mail with the program chair prior to submission.

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library
(PENDING).

Papers must be written in English and submitted electronically at
http://www.easychair.org/conferences?conf=ilc2010 in PDF or WORD
format.  Final submissions must not exceed 15 pages and need to use
the ACM format, for which templates can be found at:
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html.

Each paper should explain its contributions in both general and
technical terms, identifying what has been accomplished, explaining
why it is significant, and comparing it with previous work. Authors
should strive to make their papers understandable to a broad audience.
Each paper will be judged according to its significance, novelty,
correctness, clarity, and elegance.

The official language of the conference is English.  Some further
information is available at the conference web site, with more details
added later.  See: http://www.international-lisp-conference.org

Technical Program:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Original submissions in all areas related to the conference themes are
invited for the following categories.

 * Papers: Technical papers of up to 15 pages that describe original
   results or explain known ideas in new and elegant ways.

 * Demonstrations: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for demonstrations of
   tools, libraries, and applications.

 * Tutorials: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for in-depth presentations
   about topics of special interest for at least 90 minutes and up to
   180 minutes.

 * Workshops: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for groups of people who
   intend to work on a focused topic for half a day.

 * Panel discussions: Abstracts of up to 4 pages for discussions about
   current themes. Panel discussion proposals must mention panel
   members who are willing to partake in a discussion.

 * Lightning talks: Abstracts of up to one page for talks to last for
   no more than 5 minutes.

Depending on the technical content, each submitted paper will be
classified by the program committee as either a technical paper or as
an experience paper; and authors will be informed about this
classification.  Note that all interesting submissions are considered
valuable contributions to the success of the ILC series of
conferences.  As in past ILC's since 2007, accepted papers in both
categories will be presented at the conference, included in the
proceedings, and submitted to the ACM digital library.

I just got a copy of "LiSP in Small Pieces".
On page xix he gives a reference for the source code as well as his email
but as with he and it have moved on:

http://pagesperso-systeme.lip6.fr/Christian.Queinnec/WWW/LiSP.html

just in case anyone needs to go on this particular snipe hunt.

Cheers, Gene
