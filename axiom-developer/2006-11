Sigh.  As usual, I cannot reproduce on the mac to which I have
access.  I'm assuming you see the same issue with

(defun foo (x) (declare (long-float x)) (the long-float (sqrt x)))
(compile 'foo)

Am also assuming that the read-byte test I posted earlier now passes. 

In any case, would you please mind stepping through gdb again to the
same place?  It should be obvious what is going on.  The idea is that
the MY_PLT list in plt.h should have one _ stripped, and that the
string passed to my_plt should do the strip in the stn() C macro right
before the (second) call to bsearch.

I'll be leaving town tomorrow afternoon until Sunday, but would be
happy to fix this quickly today if possible.

Take care,

OK, sock_get_string_buf, which appears correctly prototyped, is
returning 0, which from the code appears to indicate a socket read
error in one of the routines in sockio-c.c.

Fellow axiom developers -- any ideas here?

>=20

Yes. It seems that problem might be that 'sqrt' does not
appear in plt.h. So I added a call to sqrt(d); in plttest.c
and I am running it again.

Make sense?

Yes, indeed, and this is now committed.  Thanks!

As the comments in plt.c indicate, we still need a mechanism whereby
improvements to gcl_cmpopt.lsp (which result in writing more C symbols
into compiled files) seemlessly updates plttest.c.  Right now, we just
have to remember to make the change in both places, which in this case
failed :-(.

cvs head has a more thorough plttest which resists C optimizers'
attempts to eliminate dead code.  I see no reason for a backport at
the moment.

Ok, with your earlier change plus adding 'sqrt(d);' to plttest.c
that did it! At least I think so. The Axiom build is still
proceeding but it is well into the algebra compiles now and it
seldom fails in gcl if it gets this far... This machine is
pretty slow, so it'll probably two or three hours to complete.

Here's the patch:

ppc-osx3:~/osx $ diff -au old/gcl*/o/plttest.c new/gcl*/o/plttest.c
--- old/gcl-2.6.8pre/o/plttest.c        Thu Dec 15 10:14:18 2005

@@ -40,7 +40,7 @@

   exp(d);
   log(d);
-
+  sqrt(d);
   return 0;

 }
ppc-osx3:~/osx $

--------

The only other problem I encountered is a problem with the
Axiom source, I think. All occurrence of

  echo ')load ${OUT}/xxxx' >> ...

in the src/*/Makefile.pamphlet files had to be replaced with

  echo ')load ${OUT}/xxxx.${OUTEXT}' >> ...

Without the extension the build fails looking for a file
names xxxx.8

I don't know where the .8 comes from, but I think it must
have something to do with how Axiom handles the default
extension. Although I am surprised that I have only seen
this here on this PowerPC OSX 10.2 platform and not on any
other builds... ???

I'll send a patch for Axiom after I get a change to repeat
the Axiom build with a newer version of build-improvements.

Thanks for all your help!

Regards,
Bill Page.

PS. Does anyone want me to try an gcl-based Maxima build
on this OSX machine?

I again had problem with "sock_get_string_buf": trying to use hypertex
functions which require Axiom (for example search or tutorial input)
gives:

(1) ->
   >> System error:
   Unexpected end of #<string-input stream from "                ...">.

Recent patch to gcl fixed the problem on many machines. But on one
machine (using 2.4.31 kerenel) I was still getting this error.

So I tried the patch below and it solved the problem.  AFAICS the
problem is that GCL string parameter wants to preserve string
_value_, but what Axiom want is pass by reference.  My undersanding
is that GCL has full right to copy the string, so the only relaiable
solution must use 'object' type and extract string address from it.

Remark1: It seems that "official" GCL foreign function interface is
is very incomplete for real world needs. I would suggest either
promoting 'object' structure as documented, official low level
interface, or adding few more arguments types (mostly arrays by reference).

Remark 2: This may be related to Debian bug 328480 (but what Camm
wrote seem indicate different problem).

I have PowerPC and Intel Macs running OS X 10.4.8 with fink, and I'd 
like to try building axiom on them as well.

Are these changes in the build-improvements branch?

You should add that 'asq' does not work with uncompressed databases.

No, not everything is in build-improvements yet - give us a few
more hours. :-)

In the mean time I would be very interested if you could start
by just trying to buiuld the gcl lisp compiler. This is a pre-
requiste for the Axiom build. You can get the version we will be
using in build-improvements directly from the gcl CVS archive via
the command line:

$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gcl -z9 export \
  -Dtoday -d gcl-2.6.8pre -r Version_2_6_8pre gcl

and then do

$ cd gcl-2.6.8pre
$ ./configure --prefix=3D/usr/local
$ make

Ask if you need mor details. Let us know how it works.

Thanks.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Axiom sources contain two copies of 'util.ht': one is
'src/hyper/pages/util.ht', the second is
'src/share/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht'.  This causes build problems
since when re-making different copy may be installed. Also
'ht.db' is build when pages from 'src/hyper/pages' (including 'util.ht')
are installed. If 'src/share/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht' is intalled
later it makes 'ht.db' out of date.

I would propose removing one copy of 'util.ht' (removing
'src/share/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht' would make Makefile logic
simpler, so IMHO this one is preferred).  Also, 'src/hyper/pages/ht.db'
us useless (it should be re-created by the build process) and
potentially confusing (it may easily get out of date), so
it should be also removed from the repository.

This indeed fixes the above -- thanks!  Some axiom code must be
declining do write to a copied buffer or some such.

May I suggest adding

          "   if (x->st.st_fillp<j) FEerror(\"string too small\",0);"

to the wrapper.  In general, we might want a non-null terminated
buffer type of a given length in the C interface too.  I'm guessing
this is what you mean by arrays by reference.  Documenting object is a
good idea too.

Last comment -- GCL stores strings by default in relocatable memory --
i.e. they are copied at each gc.  This is much faster.  An immovable
type in 'contiguous" memory is also an option, via

(make-array 10 :element-type 'character :static t)

If axiom needs these pointers not to move across gc, may I please
suggest using the latter.  I've already checked, the pointers in use
are relocatable.

I'll apply this patch and upload a new Debian package closing the
bug.  BTW, axiom is again in Debian testing (aka etch).

Take care,

All versions of hypertex that I used crashed (or maybe showed nothing)
when I clicked "Uses" or "Dependants" field in a description of a constructor.

AFAICS recent versions of Axiom have two problems here:

1) databases which contain corresponding information (USERS.DAASE
   and DEPENDENTS.DAASE) were not installed
2) infamous 'probe-file' problem

The patch below correct both problems. It also fixes the
"Cannot rename the file erlib to NRLIB" problem. I also added
sensible dependency in database rule, so that all databses
are re-made when one get out of date. And 'RDEFIOSTREAM' is
now called in error-checking mode (old code happily passed
bad pathnames and supressed error checking).

It's just what I use, not that I disagree.

PS: For $erase (see another mail) I directly use directoryp.

No very strong reason. However:

1) 'axiom-probe-file' is intended to be good replacement for 'probe-file'.
   More precisely, Axiom uses directories to implement what Microsoft
   would call "structured storage" and old IBM systems called "partitioned
   data sets". Such directories from Axiom point of view are equivalent
   to files.
2) I did not check all uses of 'probe-name', so it was not clear if
   change in 'probe-name' is apropriate.
3) 'probe-name' is doing a lot of extra work (calls 'probe-file' first,
   then calls 'namestring'

Concerning erase: I would prefer to limit use of 'directoryp':=20
something which has name endig in 'p' should return a boolean.
What 'directoryp' returns is unexepected, so wide use of 'directoryp'
would make interpreter code hareder to read.

Well, the build of AXIOMsys completed successfully. You can
download a console-only version of Axiom for native MAC OSX 10
on PowerPC here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/public/AXIOMsys-ppc-20061101.tgz

As usual, untar it into a convenient place like /usr/local

  $ cd /usr/local
  $ tar xzf ~/AXIOMsys-ppc-20061101.tgz

and then setup the AXIOM and PATH variables like this:

  $ export AXIOM=3D/usr/local/powerpc-apple-darwin6.8
  $ export PATH=3D$AXIOM/bin:$PATH

and start Axiom like this:

  $ AXIOMsys

  (1) -> integrate(1/sqrt(1-x^2),x)

exit Axiom with this command:

  (99) -> )quit
  yes

--------

The MAC server on which this was compiled did not have an X-windows
environment so it was not possible to compile and test Axiom Graphics
and the Hyperdoc browser. Also native MAC OSX10 apparently does not
have support for the pts virtual terminal interface so it is not
possible yet to compile clef (the replacement for readline).

Because of these problems, it is not possible to use the existing
Axiom source distribution without some changes to accommodate
the limited hardware environment. But if you are familiar with
development on a MAC and would like to give this a try, please
let you know and I can make the current preliminary sources
available.

I look forward to some comments from MAC users! :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

OK, as you've gotten a successful build, there is really very little
chance of memory corruption.  And I'm surmising that the larger
save-system image has to do with the native unexmacosx code we have
courtesy of Aurelien.  In fact, I have never really studied this code,
so he is currently the only person in the world likely to have such
knowledge at the moment!

This .8 is still odd.  Might be interesting to add )lisp
si::*load-types* somewhere to examine the defaults.

I've built macosx maxima in the past, but youre mileage may vary :-). 

I am concluding that with the possible exception of fc6, gcl 2.6.8 is
ready vis a vis axiom.  It would be most helpful if someone could
confirm the Fedora status for me.

Take care,

Does this mean that "uses" works now?

If so, I have to get build improvements immediately!

Typical uses I can see are:

1) calling operating system.  This typically uses scalars and strings,
   but may require structures.
2) calling numerial librarires.  Such librarires typically operate
   on floating point arrays, but may also need integer arrays.

While support for C structures would be nice, one can use arrays
of apropriate size and use Lisp byte operations to emulate C

AFAICS C code does not store pointers to Lisp data (and there are no
callbacks from C to Lisp). If (as I hope) GCL will not trigger garbage
collection form a signal handler, keeping strings in relocatable memory
should be safe.

As far as I know probe-name is only used in nlib.lisp.pamphlet.

Yes, and namestring is not necessary.

Yes, not the lisp convention.

Anyway these things need to be fixed, no matter for me how this will be
done. Thank you so much (as Martin implicitly says :-). I am, as Martin,
a Hyperdoc adept.=20

>=20

I think the foremost reason is that clef (aka. "edible") was part
of Axiom long before readline existed.

Second, clef does have some Axiom command completions that are not
built-in to readline but I think readline is also configurable,
and could provide such functionality, right?

Third, to the best of my knowledge readline is the only part of
GCL that is licenses as GPL. If readline is disabled, then GCL might
be considered compatible with Axiom's BSD-style non-copyleft license.
(I am not sure if this is important to anyone interesting in Axiom
any more.)

Personally, I would prefer to get rid of clef and adapt readline
because it would simply the Axiom process tree structure. On the
other hand, readline can be a pain sometimes when you are trying
to drive a program through a pipe and/or pty interface... so it
is desirable also to be able to disable readline also.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Great!

I would like to see the final patch, e.g. the things that would be
committed, including the explanation of what the code and what is
going in the pamphletss.

The point is that Axiom can take input from multiple sources.  For
example you can fire a few copies of 'spadclient' and you can
interact with each copy separately.  In particular, hypertex can
send spad expresions for Axiom to evaluate.  Currently, input is
sent via sockets and line buferred, so in this mode readline
included in Axiom is not used.

Strictly speaking, clef could be dropped: one could link
readline into spadclient.  However, this will remove one
use of pty.  The second pty is used by 'sman' to intercept
normal Axiom input and output.  AFAICS this pty may be
eliminated with moderate effort.

BTW: I do not belive that MACOSX does not support pty's.
It may do it in slightly different way, but quite a lot
of unix programs (beggining with Xterm) would brake
without pty's.

Yes.

I don't know; that is probably true; I have to read GCL's configuration
options.  But, building Axiom as we currently do, I have

    [18:20]% strings =AXIOMsys | grep rl_

>=20

I would be glad to hear more information about this.
I found several references on the web stating clearly that
the pty interface was not available on the MAC. With respect
to Xterm on MAC is did also see some references to special
purpose code in Xterm to provide some kind of emulation of
pty for the MAC. Maybe it would be possible use/adapt that
code... but that is beyond my level of experience and
available time.

It would be greate if someone could share their knowledge
and experience with this issue.

clef knows more than readline. given an input file it can do smart
command line completion of things like domain names.

Hmmm... Yes I do have a path set to point at a library that is
compiled as part of gettext:

  $ echo $LIBRARY_PATH
  /home/users/b/bi/billpage/osx/lib:/usr/lib:

I set this originally because I had some problems compiling
GCL with built-in gettext support. But perhaps this is not
necessary. I will try a build of GCL and Axiom without this
set.

If you do have libintl somewhere on you system, perhaps you
can try setting

export LIBRARY_PATH=3D/usr/lib/where-ever-it-is

I am surprised to see the AXIOMsys binary include a full
path name to this external library! Must be something pretty
weird about these .dylib files. ;)

Ok, tommorrow.

Thanks for checking in to this!

I am affraid I can not really offer Mac experience. However
the first Goole hit for: MACOSX pty is:

Mac OS X pty Permission Security Issue

Now, something which does not exits should have no security
problems, so I would belive that Mac OS X has pty.  OTOH
this security problem is solved by Unix 98 pty's (in other
words Linux /dev/ptmx and /dev/pts), so we can infer that
Mac OS X has only legacy pty (so you should use BSD
branch). 

BTW: I you are logged into a Mac OS X machine you can try
to look is '/dev' directory contains things like '/dev/ptyq0'
and '/dev/ttyq0' (this is a traditional name for legacy
pty's).

Perhaps linedit would be of interest?

http://common-lisp.net/project/linedit/

I doubt it's a drop-in replacement but in theory it would be a good fit
with a lot of lisps instead of just GCL, which might be useful for
things like porting down the road.  And its license should pose no
problem.

On PowerPC, make fails:

gcc  -o raw_pre_gcl  \
-L.    -lpre_gcl `echo -lSM -lICE  -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXmu -lXt -lXext
-lXaw -lX11    -lm  -lreadline -lncurses | sed -e 's/-lncurses/ /'`
-lintl -lc -lgclp
/usr/bin/ld: can't locate file for: -lintl
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

Fink installed a version of libintl from gettext-dev 0.10.40, so I've
added a "-L/sw/lib" and am retrying the build now.

On Intel, configure of gmp fails, as it can't figure out the machine
type. I have gmp 4.2.1 installed with fink, but I don't think I can
build gcl with that version of gmp.

Yes you are right. The reference I read earlier was that OSX 10.3
does not have support for posix grantpt... Maybe things have
change in OSX a lot since 10.3.

Yes, I see for example:

ppc-osx3:~/osx $ ls /dev/ptyq*
/dev/ptyq0 /dev/ptyq3 /dev/ptyq6 /dev/ptyq9 /dev/ptyqc /dev/ptyqf
/dev/ptyq1 /dev/ptyq4 /dev/ptyq7 /dev/ptyqa /dev/ptyqd
/dev/ptyq2 /dev/ptyq5 /dev/ptyq8 /dev/ptyqb /dev/ptyqe
ppc-osx3:~/osx $

But when I try to build clef I get:

ppc-osx3:~/osx/axiom.build-improvements/src/clef $ make
gcc ./edible.o
-L/home/users/b/bi/billpage/osx/axiom.build-improvements/src/clef/../../

These are all pty external routines.

Maybe it is just that I don't understand that MAC library setup.

Any ideas?

There was another axiom user of late who implemented a GCL blas/lapack
interface within axiom.  It is fairly straightforward, but one needs
to make sure the arrays are static.  One can ensure this by checking
that the address is < heap_end.  Even though these external routines
do not call lisp, nor do they store references across calls, static is
still needed as they call malloc, which GCL redirects to protect
itself, and which can therefore trigger a gc.  I believe the same
logic should apply to the axiom socket code.  If 1) no pointers are
stored across calls 2) no lisp callbacks are made 3) no heap
allocation is made (alloca is OK), then relocatable pointers are fine.
Of course if one can use relocatable, it is better, as it is faster.

(On Debian, BTW, one can compile and load a simple defentry
blas/lapack api, call compiler::link adding -lblas -llapack -lg2c to
the command line, and then run the new image against whatever
optimized atlas library that might be available without
recompilation.)

We went through this with GMP bignums.  We had to implement a special
GC escape mechanism within GMP calls to protect the much faster
relocatable bignum algorithm.

Take care,

Here is a recipe that seems to work for me and avoids reference
to fink or other non-gcl related libraries:

 $ export
LIBRARY_PATH=3D/home/users/b/bi/billpage/osx/new/gcl-2.6.8pre/binutils/in=
t
l
 $ make clean
 $ ./configure --prefix=3D/usr/local --enable-locbfd =
--disable-statsysbfd
 $ make
 $ make install

I have a new batch of Axiom cooking with this version of gcl.

Note: It seems to be necessary to specify the --endable-locfd option
to ensure that the bfd internal to gcl is configured with internal
gettext.

>=20

Too bad. :-( There are some options that affect gcl's use of gmp.
See ./configure --help  You might try:

  --disable-dynsysgmp

I have also Cc: Camm Maquire, the primary GCL developer who might
have some other suggestions for your Mac Intel platform.

Thanks.

Bill Page.

My bad, this was a configure error in gcl, not gmp. The gmp configure
and build seems to work. I made a copy of h/powerpc-macosx.defs and
h/powerpc-macosx.h and called

 ./configure --enable-machine=3Di386-macosx --prefix=3D/usr/local
--enable-locbfd --disable-statsysbfd

Now there's some problems with malloc.h not being found. configure.in
has a test for powerpc-macosx that should be duplicated for the new
i386-macosx target. I'll work on it some more tomorrow.

Tim,

For the Fedora Core 6 it looks like it is also missing the binutils package.

It compiled fine for me in Ubuntu after installing it.

Regards,

Alfredo

readline is licensed under GPL (not LGPL). When Axiom was a commercial 
product, it could not use readline. Now it cannot use readline, too, 
because it is BSD-licensed (arrgh).

Ooops. Wrong list. This discussion should go to axiom-legal
which was created for the express purpose of keeping legal
issues out of the developer list. Please use that list instead.

I had an email discussion with Richard Stallman about the issue of
using GPL and BSD licensed programs together in a non-commmercial
setting. His statement is that the two licenses are compatible and he
sees no license problems that arise in either direction.

That said, I beg of you not to continue a legal discussion in
the developer list.

Tim

These are Unix 98 pty routines.  Somebody should check if Mac OS X
10.4 supports them, but all sources claim that earlier versions
do not have them.

.ht, .pht, .bitmap, .pixmap, .xbm and .data in Axiom distribution are
text files.  Hyperdoc uses byte counts to access .ht and .pht, but
the file positions should be recomputed anyway.

Postscript files are more tricky: .ps files in Axiom distribution
are text files, but in general Postscript may contain binary data.
I think in the future we should decide if we want binary Postscript
in source repository (ATM I did not touch .ps files).

I've been using Axiom together with readline plus completions using:

rlwrap -c -f /usr/local/axiom/mnt/fedora5/lib/command.list axiom -noclef

in order to get vi style command line editing capabilities:

http://blog.superadditive.com/2006/10/28/using-axiom-with-vi-keystrokes/

For the moment it has worked well.

Well, as you see, I did not (yet) remove the svn:eol-style property from 
the .pamphlet files in the SourceForge trunk for exactly that reason. 
But I tend to agree with Bill when he said that we should simply 
introduce the rule: Axiom uses Unix-style line endings, no matter on 
which OS you are working.

Since I don't live too deep in .ht and .pht things, what does that mean?
Do you want to recompute the byte-offsets at the time these files are 
copied to the /mnt directory? If you do that then it clearly classifies 
those files as being generated and no source anymore. Then they should 
not live under SVN at all.

Ooops. I didn't know that also postscript can contain binary stuff. I 
thought that binaries (pictures) are somehow converted into some 7bit 
ASCII before they go into a .ps file. I must be wrong, but I cannot 
rememeber that I have ever looked at a .ps with binary data. Maybe I did 
not look closely enough.

I somehow believe that sooner or later at least the pictures that are 
generated from Axiom commands will go away.

The HyperDoc screenshots are probably more tricky to generate 
automatically at compile-time.

Byte offsets are stored in 'ht.db' -- I proposed its removal from
the source repository.  .pht things could be generated, but ATM
this stops at various places waiting for keyboard input.  The largest
.ht files are NAG documention -- we have no source the generate them.
Most of the other .ht files are generated (extracted) from Axiom book,
but we need to write an extraction program.  For this it would help
to see NAG version of Axiom book -- the one in open is heavily
modified by Tim.

msgfmt is part of gettext. You need the following options to
encourage gcl to use it's own built-in version of gettext:

./configure --enable-locbfd --disable-statsysbfd

These should be the default of MAC OSX

GCL should work fine with this version.  The Debian GCL package links

Just a note, this should be the default if no external gmp is found.

In what sense that "more knowledge" is unattainable with readline.
I dislike all those duplicated things in Axiom.  They are nothing but
source of confusion.

Yes, GCL has upgraded to more recent binutils, which is compile-time
incompatible with the older version.  configure should figure this out
and backoff to the local copy automatically, but this really might be
more of a feature than a bug.  --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd is
needed here, and in fact in most of your other examples.  Would it be
possible to retest with these configure commands?  Perhaps this should
be the default, though it is wasteful from a compile-time point of
view.  Still bfd is somewhat unique in that the upstream specifically
forbids the normal type of shared library dependency as its internal
api changes so frequently and without notice.

Take care,

Either you install BDF development package, or you call GCL's
configure with --enable-locbfd so that GCL builds its own version of
BFD.  Axiom.build-improvements test at configure time whether BFD
development is present, is not not it invokes GCL's configure with
--enable-locbfd. 

In the future, GCL should do that -- I'll commit patch to GCL's trunk,
not 2.6.8pre branch.

locbfd should be the default on macosx, as we have Aurelien's specific
mods for .o file loading.  Extending this default to the intel should
resolve the -lintl 'out of the box'.  This said, I'd be quite
(pleasantly) surprised if Aurelien's code works as is on intel.  This
should be tried first -- if you can compile and load a simple file,
all is well.  Otherwise, the brain-dead default entry-level loading
option is --disable-statsysbfd --enable-dlopen.  This is limited in
that compiler::link instead of save-system must be used to save
images, and that no more than 1024 loads are supported on most
machines (as each requires an open file descriptor).

BTW, out of town till Sunday.

Take care,

Something subtle is still not right about this. If I omit --enable-locbfd
from the .configure then I get problems later gettext (unless gettext
is already installed elsewhere).

But worse is this:

 $ export
LIBRARY_PATH=/home/users/b/bi/billpage/osx/new/gcl-2.6.8pre/binutils/intl

Something is strange about the way that gcl links to libintl.
On MAC OS if I do not include LIBRARY_PATH and if libintl is
not in the system default path, then building gcl fails.

If I do include the 'export LIBRARY_PATH ..." then the build
succeeds but loading this library is "dynamic". This causes
trouble later if I try to use gcl to build Axiom without first
setting LIBRARY_PATH. Isn't there some way to force the MAC
to static link this library?

Yes, up until a few minutes ago, by default on macosx you should get
local bfd with gettext, providing the -lintl on the link command
line.  But msgfmt is still not in the path, though might be made so.
In any case, I just added --disable-nls which omits these calls to
msgfmt.

I have the following on axiom.build-improvements to detect that.

    If GCL is not present in the build environment (a very common

    most platforms), we must build one from a copy included in the
    Axiom tarball.  However, GCL relies on the libirary BFD, the include
    headers of which may not exist (quite common).  In order to avoid
    failure while building GCL, we test for the existence of [[<bfd.h>]]
    and the corresponding library.  We configure GCL to
    use its own copy of BFD accordingly.

    <<gcl options>>=
    axiom_host_has_bfd_h=
    axiom_host_has_libbfd=
    AC_CHECK_HEADER([bfd.h], [axiom_host_has_bfd_h=yes])
    AC_HAVE_LIBRARY([bfd], [axiom_host_has_libbfd=yes])

    axiom_gcl_bfd_option=
    if test x"$axiom_host_has_bfd_h" = xyes \
        && test x"$axiom_host_has_libbfd" = xyes; then
        axiom_gcl_bfd_option="--enable-statsysbfd"
    else
        axiom_gcl_bfd_option="--disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd"
    fi

    GCLOPTS="--enable-vssize=65536*2 --disable-dynsysbfd \
                $axiom_gcl_bfd_option --enable-maxpage=256*1024"

Consider the domain and range of an SCM. It should map files to files
as an identity operation with a side-effect of maintaining history.
An SCM only needs to know that bytes are bytes. Maintaining history
as diff-format files is an optimization, not a requirement.

Changing \n-files to \r\n-files is the responsibility of some other tool.
If the translation occurs at all it should live in the client end since
that is the part that knows about the user environment.

In general the repository should contain whatever files are needed
to make the project. Clearly documentation will require various
binary files such as jpg, flv, mov, mp3, etc. These will change 
over the life of the project and need to be historically tracked
just like everything else.

Although I chose arch and it "does the right thing" I have to say
that GIT seems to have the SCM philosophy most clearly implemented.

On Mac OS X 10.4.8 PowerPC:

code checked out today with:

$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gcl -z9  co  \

$ export LIBRARY_PATH=`pwd`/binutils/intl
$ make clean
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local  --enable-locbfd --disable-statsysbfd
$ make

fails with a bunch of warnings like:

/usr/bin/ld: warning multiple definitions of symbol _Tcl_InitStubs

and then

Actually that fails also with the same output.

The apt-get worked for debian-style systems like debian and ubuntu.

Yum does not know about binutils-dev which is a debian package
so Fedora 6 still won't build. I searched for the binutils-dev
equivalent but have not yet found it.

There is no apt-get or yum tool for the MAC that I can find.

Are you double sure of this? Your result doesn't make sense
because gcl internally builds it's own version of gettext
as part of the bfd build and finds msgfmt there *internally*.
This works for me on the MAC OSX that I have been using.

You should not have to install binutils-dev *if* you ask gcl
to use it's own built-in version.

You don't need to install binutils so you don't need
apt-get or yum.

By that I mean, did you scrap the previous gcl directory 'rm -rf *'
and start completely fresh? I've seem a few case where gcl does
not cleanup very well. (Sorry, I didn't document at the time.)

Note also that Camm committed new changes to gcl-2.6.8pre
just this morning that could affect this behaviour.

At the time clef, hyperdoc, graphics, etc were written we were using
X10 (not the house wireless, the pre-X11 windows) on 6MHz PCs. These
ideas were invented within the group to solve problems, not because
we wanted our own copies.

At the time the internet did not have google. Heck, it didn't even
have gopher, the browser didn't exist, and graphics amounted to the
original "screensaver" ideas of Dave Chess. Linux wasn't around until
later (and fit on 3 diskettes, collecting mold in my basement).

If readline can do completions perhaps we should feed it the
symbols in compress.daase.

I suspected they were invented to solve problems.  Thankfully, we are in
2006 now.  readline has been around for more than a decade.
I'm trying to understand what would a barrier to stop the homegrown
clef (which from my experience is source of frustration) and use a
standard readline.

Without any path setting?  In any case, I jsut checked, and it just

We cannot do this, unless we change the license of Axiom to GPL.
Remember the story of clisp? RMS has forced the author of clisp to change 
his license to GPL, because it used (and still uses) readline, which is 
GPL (not LGPL) (in spite of the fact that this author claimed that 
readline is optional).

In fact, the current Axiom distribution falls under GPL anyway, because 
gcl is built with several GPL parts (including readline, but not only); 
this is (correctly!) stated in Camm's .deb package.

Waldek,

Thank you! Your patch to openpty for MAC OSX worked perfectly.
clef now compiles correctly. :-)

I think this change should go in.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

Raymond,

Please download the new binary for AXIOMsys on MAC OSX PowerPC from:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/public/AXIOMsys-ppc-20061102.tgz

This version was created using the version of libintl that is
internal to gcl. I have tried it without any LIBRARY_PATH setting
and after removing the original build directories, and it seems
to work for me.

Everyone else with a PowerPC MAC is encouraged to try it too!

Please let me know how/if it works.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I still was having problems with libintl not being found, I finally
figured out that my makedefs file still had -lintl, I think we need to
change h/powerpc-macosx.defs:

I'm a little confused. I have both fink and XCode installed. AFAIK, fink
requires the XCode gcc compilers and the rest of the toolchain installed.=


On the other hand, the current gcl sources require pdflatex to process
the documentation, and I have that installed from fink. Which pdflatex
are you using?

Have you removed fink from your system, or just installed the XCode
compilers?

I tracked the problem one step further:

There is a bug in 'sockio-c.c.pamphlet'. Namely, 'remote_stdio'
function contains the following code:

    if (FD_ISSET(0, &rd)) {
      fgets(buf,1024,stdin);
      len = strlen(buf);
      /*
          gets(buf);
          len = strlen(buf);
          *(buf+len) = '\n';
          *(buf+len+1) = '\0';
      */
      swrite(sock, buf, len, "writing to remote stdin");

If we have EOF on stdin fgets reads nothing and the old content
of 'buf' (containing the last AXIOMsys output!) is sent back to
AXIOMsys.  I am not sure what the correct fix is: we can easily
detect EOF, but we can not just exit: to exit we have kill
the whole tree of processes spawned by 'sman'.  The code above
is executed from 'spadclient' and it is possible to have
more than one copy of 'spadclient' connected to one AXIOMsys,
so we probably should track number of connected clients
and exit AXIOMsys when number of clients goes down to zero
(but we have to be careful at startup, as for short time
there is no client).

Camm,

I removed the -lintl from powerpc-macosx.defs LIBS line
and now I can successfully build GCL on MAC OSX with the options
./configure --enable-locbfd --disable-statsysbfd --disable-nls
on the MAC OSX PPC platform.

I tried:

GCL
> (setq a 3)
> (system::save-system "test")
./test
a
 
and get the answer 3

===========================================

the same configure options work on RedHat 7.2


I'm going to try the test on FC6.

On one machine documentation searching did not work. The problem
was that on that machine there was already intalled 'htsearch'
program (which is searching trough HTML pages) and hypertex
picked the instlled program (which was on the PATH) insted of
Axiom version.  AFAICS the simplest solution for this problem
is to put Axiom directory first in the PATH.

I also noticed that summary of search results was incorrect.

The patch below fixes both problems:

Bill --

  There should be only one main repository -- /trunk.  My
understanding was that /silver was created as an intermediate step,
preventively, to make sure that we did not lose any data.  Is that
correct?

The complete correction should invoke Axiom's htsearch with either

Could you give that a shot?

No such luck. Considering that h/powerpc-macosx.h has inline (PowerPC)
assembly, it's not likely to work (line 91).

The code is for "Processor cache synchronization code." I'm definitely
in over my head here. I don't have the foggiest notion how to implement
the equivalent on Intel Macs.

Can I simply delete the cache sync code and try this?

I just re-tried using gcl-2.6.8 on Debian unstable.  Previously
build died when making BSD (due to 'msgfmt').  I wanted to test
'--disable-nls' option, but this time build failed much earlier,
already gcl configure barfed:

....
# Subconfigure of BFD done
# ------------------------
#
checking for long... yes
checking size of long... 8
checking sizeof struct contblock... Cannot find sizeof struct contblock
checking build system type... make[1]: *** [/home/s/test/tt/axiom5/ax-build3/build/x86_64-unknown-linux/bin/gcl] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/home/s/test/tt/axiom5/ax-build3/lsp'
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
....

The machine was not updated for long time, so this may be due to
machine misconfiguration...

AFAIK that this code is not needed on Intel processors (processor
should automatically keep caches in sync).

For htsearch alone this is resonably easy, the following snippet
from 'man0.ht' (in two copies) is responsible for its invocation.

\menuunixlink{Search}
  {htsearch "\stringvalue{pattern}"}
  \tab{15} Reference documentation ({\em *} wild card is not accepted).

We should use '{\$SPAD/bin/htsearch "\stringvalue{pattern}"}' or
'{\$AXIOM/bin/htsearch "\stringvalue{pattern}"}' instead.  
But there is also a lot of references to 'viewAlone' (this can be
solved with extra sed rule). 'spadclient' use wrong path...

Axiom's a pretty complex system, and it seems to have picked up a bunch
of other projects like clef, noweb, and gcl, and like all good lisp
systems,  even recursive project dependencies like gcl has it's own bfd,
and gmp.

There is still a set of external dependencies that have to be satisfied,
like pdflatex, gcc, and others.

The recent clef/readline thread points out it may be advantageous to
review the list of internal and external dependencies, and prune some cod=
e.

What are people thinking about the builds of axiom? Debian tries to
patch axiom to use system supplied tools and libraries where possible,
the Mac OS X port tries to use local copies of everything.
build-improvements stated goals are to automagically pick up any
installed copies and build the rest internally.

I ask because I had to mangle ./configure to fix a test for
malloc/malloc.h on Intel Mac. Neither of the autoconf programs installed
on my Mac like the configure.in in gcl-2.6.8pre:

$ /sw/bin/autoconf --version
autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.60

$ /usr/bin/autoconf --version
autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.59

configure says it's been generated with autoconf 2.13.

I guess there's really no way to ship axiom with it's own autoconf if we
have any expectation of using configure to build axiom, but how far down
do we plan to go? I saw Gaby is seriously considering integrating gcl
and gcc.

Gaby and Waldek,

As we discussed last week (see "famous" diagram attached below),
SourceForge svn /silver was created so that we would have an
svn branch automatically maintained in sync with Tim's "official"
tla axiom--silver--1. This is now in place. A Tailor script runs
every night to update svn /silver with Tim's latest patches.

To get this to work, Tailor has to *start* in a state with the
svn branch exactly equal to the tla branch. I could not find any
automatic way to merge the existing svn /trunk with tla
axiom--silver--1, so I let Tailor bootstrap svn /silver directly
from tla axiom--silver--1 as the first step in setting up the
automatic synchronization.

Tim Daly agreed to apply all the patches that are unique to
svn /trunk to axiom--silver--1. These were accurately identified
by Waldek Hebisch in a series of emails last week. Because of the
auto sync, this will effectively merge svn /trunk into svn /silver
(see diagram below). In addition Tim will also continue to merge
any patches that he receives by email (and approves) into tla
axiom--silver--1, whence to svn /silver.

My current proposal is that when Tim's merge of the old svn /trunk
into svn /silver is accomplished, then svn /silver should become the
new official "trunk" and the existing svn /trunk should be deleted.
As I understand it, whether or not we eventually rename svn /silver
to svn /trunk is probably only important to people who care more
about standard svn terminology than either Tim Daly or me. ;)

There are two active svn branches on SourceForge, build-improvements
and hersen-algebra-improvements. Both of these were originally
cloned from svn /trunk. There might be some advantage to retain
the original svn /trunk until at least the merging of these
branches into the new svn /silver "trunk" is complete. Again,
please refer to diagram.

Of course this discussion is not over and I am open to suggestions
as to how to improve the situation.

In any case, please keep in mind that we had previously agreed that
all patches to silver would be sent by email to Tim Daly and that
he would be responsible for review and applying these changes to
axiom--silver--1. That is the route by which patches are supposed
to the new svn /silver "trunk".

Regards,
Bill Page.

yes, that is annoying.  I tripped over that issue a couple of days ago. 
Mostly, it is a matter of GCL's configure.in being "under-quoted" --
it needs more quotes in several places, especially those with nested
macro invokations.  The world is at Autoconf 2.60; GCL's is stuck at
Autoconf 2.13.  I did not want to mess with it more than needed
especially on the gcl-2.6.8pre branch.  However, I definitely consider
a lifting for gcl-2.7.x.

The integration of GCL to GCC is not going to happen for GCC-4.3 (we
just entered the initial development phase for GCC-4.3).  It
probably is something like GCC-4.4.0 or GCC-4.5.0.

However, GCL's configure.in issue is easily solved though.  

What specifically did you want to do with malloc/malloc.h?

I assume this error was spurious?

This looks like a Lisp problem, but on the SourceForge compile

I would like to be able to explain the differences between Tim
Daly's results above and this one. Could you both please provide
detailed information about the computer hardware and operating
system? What cpu? What version of OSX?

Hmmm... at least that is consistent with Humberto's results. :-(

Can you give me any more specific information about the cpu?
Can you suggest some command that I can give to the SourceForge
compile farm OSX system that I am using that will give equivalent
information for comparison?

If we compile gcl with the .configure option --enable-debug, then
we can get a more detailed traceback that Camm Maguire (gcl
developer) should be able to use to help diagnose the problem.

At this point I am not sure exactly what to do.

First I suppose I should start this all over again using the
newest version of gcl-2.6.8pre from cvs. This version has a
new (better) treatment of the llibintl problem.

Second, I will build gcl with --enable-debug

Third I will re-build Axiom start with the most recent source
in build-improvements. The source I used to build the current
Axiom binary for MAC is based on build-improvements as of a
couple of weeks ago plus local patches I thought I needed as
I tried to get this to work.

I will let you know when I have another binary. It will probably
not be before the weekend. Maybe someone else with there hands
directly on a MAC would like also to give this a try? If so I
recommend pulling the most recent sources from the build-
improvements branch on SourceForge. If anyone needs help with
this, just ask.

Thanks for all your help.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I have a working gcl on the ppc, what do I need to do to build
build-improvements?

Just pull the source with:

svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/ \
         branches/build-improvements axiom.build-improvements

and build with the out-of-tree gcl? or do I have to splice the gcl into
the axiom sources?

Yes.

Yes. This should be automatic if gcl is accessible in your PATH.
but you can specify ./configure --with-gcl

> or do I have to splice the gcl into the axiom sources?

No, that is not necessary.

The only problem you *might* have is that to build Axiom you
also need the noweb literate programming tools. A version of
noweb is in the build-improvements distribution and should be
built automatically as the first step of the build if you do
not already have it installed and in your PATH. But I have
had some problems in the past getting this to work (maybe it
is fixed now?) and have had to resort to untarring the noweb
tarball from the axiom build-improvements /zip directory
and building and installing it manually before attempting
to build Axiom. If you do have noweb previously installed
then use --with-noweb.

The build-improvements branch supports "out-of-source" builds
which simplifies things considerably when repeating builds.
I usuall do something like this:

 $ mkdir axiom.test
 $ cd axiom.test
 $ ../axiom.build-improvements/configure --prefix=/home/page \
  --with-noweb --with-gcl

To build Axiom you will also need latex and X11.

You might also need the openpty patch provided earlier today
by Waldek Hebisch.

Good Luck!

Regards,
Bill Page.

Well this is a long running controvery with opinions ranging from
rewriting Axiom completely in Aldor to the current bundle (which
except for noweb, gcl, and latex) are all part of the commercial 
version, to the more extreme case of fully bundling GCL and noweb.

Since opinion varies widely on this it will continue to be debated,
which is the point, really.

I'm working from a philosophy that borders on the pragmatic with a
focus on the long term (the 30 year horizon). We need to try to invent
the environment and the organization of computational mathematics that
will be considered "state of the art" in 30 years For example, we
might consider a system that allows direct manipulation of
n-dimensional varieties.  This would correspond to the underlying
mathematics similar in spirit to current solid models based on
mathematical relationships such as spline curves or finite meshes.

In the middle term we need to critique the current methods (e.g.
textual literate programming) and seek out new methods (e.g video and
interactive tools).  We need to build prototypes of these ideas.  We
also need to consider ideas like Doyen, Sage, Scientific Linux, and
Knoppix Math (a Japanese effort).

In the short term the idea is to choose tools which achieve certain
goals (e.g.  noweb for textual literate programming), modified as
necessary to fit new ideas. Some of these tools are packaged along with
the axiom distribution in the zips directory.  Everything in the
repository outside of zips (and some inside of zips) is part of the
commercial axiom build or later developments. GCL even has other
systems packaged within it.

These short term tools have been the source of controversy for
various reaons. Axiom is not yet ansi common lisp but aspires
to that goal, at which point it should run in any common lisp
rather than just GCL. However, GCL was historically developed
specifically for Axiom by Bill Schelter under contract to IBM.
I worked with Bill on various aspects of GCL, thus making it
rather easy as a first target port. In the long term the GCL
bundle should assume the status of "just another ansi common
lisp". Axiom used to run on about a dozen common lisps so it
is nearly ported except for ansi changes

Noweb was chosen as an initial literate programming tool and
axiom was completely rewritten to make every source file (almost)
into a trivial case of a literate file. There has been some
controvery over what the long term format of Axiom will be,
spread among things like ALLPROSE, straight latex, noweb, 
a lisp-based noweb, etc. All of these are "tactical" discussions
rather than long term "strategic" discussions. 

Part of the difficulty in our discussions is that we are often
arguing from different starting points. I tend to start from
the philosophy and work "top down" and insist that the ideas
should shape the tools, Some others tend to start with the tool 
and work "bottom up", insisting that the tools should shape the
ideas. The results lie somewhere in between. Running code tends
to determine the actual result.

I think most of what you said is close to a good summary.  Except the

proposing/insisting that the tools should shape the ideas, and how
that is different from your perspective.

There are still two changes to /trunk which did not appear in SF
/silver:

1) removal of 'zips/tla-1.1.tar.gz'.  

2) 8 patches in /silver/zips contain '\r' but only 2 in '/trunk/zips'
   (AFAICS each '\r' in patches is an error)

I do not think the problem is in terminology: each SF tag refer
to a unique branch.  Bill proposed to abandon /trunk and move
work to /silver. So the questions are:

1) Should any new patch be applied to /trunk ?

2) Should new patches be applied to /silver (AFAIU Bill proposed
   that)?  Tim routinely edits patches, so any patch applied to
   /silver is likely to conflict with Tim version picked from
   axiom--silver--1 (if both versions are identical, then the
   robot could easily identify a duplicate).

Can't svn co the source, I've tried several times from a clean slate and
get:

$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/ \
          branches/build-improvements axiom.build-improvements

[normal output, then]

after that, svn co fails because of a lock in the working directory:

I think this problem was reported here: it is only possible to
checkout Axiom on a case-sensitive filesytem -- so on Windows and
traditional Mac filesystem checkout fails.  This is due to files
which have names differing only in case: poly.ht contra POLY.ht
and poly.pht contra POLY.pht.  

In principle checkout should work if you use Unix filesystem on
yout Mac (but I have no idea what trick Mac OS X or svn can play
with Unix filesystem).

We should probably rename one of offending files, maybe have
'polys.ht' insted of 'poly.ht'?

In the meantime I can provide a tarball with recent checkout
if you wish.

The problem, as discussed recently, is that it is a typical problem
with "case preserving, case insensitive" filesystems (e.g. windows,
macos, etc.) because there is two files POLY.pht and poly.pht.  
I seem to remember that Waldek proposed to remove one of them.

Not yet.  In a message that I sent few minutes ago I proposed to
rename 'poly.ht' to 'polys.ht' and 'poly.pht' to 'polys.pht'.

This particular issue has nothing to do with SVN on SF.  
It is a brain-damaged filesystem issue.  Ben from Google explained the
problem a couple of days ago.

No, that's what I get for trying to develop on Mac OS X, a.k.a, the
bastard son of FreeBSD and Mac OS. Case preserving case insensitive
indeed. It's almost, but not quite, like developing on a real operating
system.

I'm trying a darcs get
http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom-darcs/ now, and if that
fails, I'll just pull the sources on a linux box and rsync them over to
the mac.

And I have written something on
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSources
which is certainly not up-to-date. Unfortunately I am to confused by 
what is master-silver and what are the copies so that I cannot update 
this page.

Please, please, don't let the AxiomSources page get out-of-date. With 
all this SCM mess nobody is going to understand where to start with.

> 1) Should any new patch be applied to /trunk ?

If we all agreed to send patches to Tim for review, then I would say no.
Silver should always be the same on axiom--silver--1, SF-/silver 
Google/trunk (or is it also Google/silver?).

i fought the same issue on the Magnus project (another open source
project i'm leading). i never managed to unlock the directory. the
only method i found was to destroy the local directory, submit
delete changes to fix the host, and restart the process from 
scratch. svn cleanup does nothing (or at least it doesn't clean up).
the whole dance cost me 8 hours.

Like I said Ben from Google was the one who explained the
filesystem issue.

I don't think it is an SVN issue.  GCC ran into similar issue (not the
rpo, the compiler) very recently.

Bill, forget about SVN for a moment.  How to you plan to keep POLY.pht
and poly.pht as separate files in the same directory using a case
preserving and case insensitive filesystem?

Thanks Ralf.

Clearly I, too, am confused about this whole replictor business.

If we can manage to be confused about which is which at this point, then
clearly something is wrong.  A week ago, I received private
communications about decreasing the number of "master" repos --
because it just is too confusing.  I suspect this is another strong
evidence to support the claim.

Now, I'm really confused about what we said we will do (and we are not 
doing), what are doing (and we should not be doing), and what we
should be doing (and are not doing).

As I have stated publically, I'm not a big fan of "forks".
But at this very point I'm considering very seriously about forking
and be done with it.

Commited.  But after extra checking I see more problem.  Namely
in 'src/hyper/bitmaps' we have the following pairs:

xi.bitmap Xi.bitmap
upsilon.bitmap Upsilon.bitmap
theta.bitmap Theta.bitmap
sigma.bitmap Sigma.bitmap
psi.bitmap Psi.bitmap
pi.bitmap Pi.bitmap
phi.bitmap Phi.bitmap
omega.bitmap Omega.bitmap
lambda.bitmap Lambda.bitmap
gamma.bitmap Gamma.bitmap
delta.bitmap Delta.bitmap

aTx=b.bitmap ATX=B.bitmap

The first group consists of images of greek letters, version with
lowercase name is lowercase letter, while uppercase letter has
the first letter of filename in upper case.

Also in 'src/doc/ps' we have 'SEGBIND.ps' and 'segbind.ps'.  'segbind.ps'
is a screen dump of a graphic window containig a parabola.  I can not
really see 'SEGBIND.ps' because it triggers Postscript stack error
in ghostscript (like many other files in 'src/doc/ps' :(.

I built the build-improvements branch with the GCL I made last night, 
and it looks like it works:

Sorry about the formatting, I think the Mac Terminal is mangling the lines.

(1) -> )set mes auto on
(1) -> 1
(1)  1                                                        Type: 
PositiveInteger
(2) -> 1+1
(2)  2                                                        Type: 
PositiveInteger

Here's the build process:

darcs get http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom-darcs/

  535  chmod +x configure
  536  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-gcl

Success!

darcs or the Mac mangled the permissions on configure and 
config/mkinstalldirs, the rest went smoothly.

I have managed to think I knew what the state was, then get told it
wasn't, then get told what I was told wasn't wasn't.  That happened
for real; it is not imaginary.

Different people act differently.  Some prefer courteous private
communication, others prefer public vocalization.  I have no trouble
with that.

| If you have an issue about the decision to let Tim Daly manage
| the update of Axiom Silver via his manual updates of his tla
| axiom--silver--1 archive (with auto sync to svn /silver),
| then I think that should be treated separately from the issue
| of the configuration of the source code archives.

I'm very happy to see Tim is making changes more visible now, than waiting
for ages before seeing light. The main reason I originally volunteered to
maintain Silver is that I do believe in "live sources". Tim suggested
at the time that he did not have time do maintain too many branches.
It therefore was a natural thing for me to volunteer to take on the
job.  Now, if Tim has more time to do the job, I'm all for it.

However, I see practical issue here:  

  (1) first, we should not have one single person as authority to
      commit changes.  Every contributor we grant write access should
      commit its own changes to silver/trunk/whatever it is
      called.  That way, we don't have to wait that only a single
      person has time and do the job.

  (2) second, he review should be public, instead of being done in
      private.  This helps people to learn possible obscure cases of
      the system -- instead of the only-one-who-knows has a
      conversation with himself and commit. 
      The changes should be sent to the list instead of Tim.

  (3) third, I'm having diffculty in following the reasoning that,
      most people would develop patches against the SVN repo,
      they will see their patches applied by someone else to a repo
      under a different SCM, and wait a day and then copied back, to
      the SVN repo just to see their changes.  That does not strike me
      as efficient.
      I consider that an extraodinary waste of time and resources.

| Commited.  But after extra checking I see more problem.  Namely
| in 'src/hyper/bitmaps' we have the following pairs:
| 
| xi.bitmap Xi.bitmap
| upsilon.bitmap Upsilon.bitmap
| theta.bitmap Theta.bitmap
| sigma.bitmap Sigma.bitmap
| psi.bitmap Psi.bitmap
| pi.bitmap Pi.bitmap
| phi.bitmap Phi.bitmap
| omega.bitmap Omega.bitmap
| lambda.bitmap Lambda.bitmap
| gamma.bitmap Gamma.bitmap
| delta.bitmap Delta.bitmap
| 
| aTx=b.bitmap ATX=B.bitmap

OK, we need a general systematic naming scheme to handle that.
I'll come back to you later.

Thanks for the detective work.

The conflict is that the master-silver is axiom--silver--1 in a) and 
SF/trunk in b). At least that is my understanding of that words. But I 
am not a native speaker, so forgive me if I am wrong.

OK. Then you also say that axiom--silver--1 is the master.

Thank you, Bill. I appreciate all your work. I was just a bit puzzled.

We are speaking here _only_ of the changes that go to the next Gold 
release.

Why not first develop on a branch as you do and then (if public review 
was long enough and (most) axiom developers agree that it should go to 
the next gold release) have Tim do the actual merge to silver?

I am so happy that Tim opened his pre-gold to the public so that we can 
see what is going to be gold.

But now we _do_ it in public. You are watched by many people on 
build-improvements.

I somehow must admit that this is probably a good point. But nobody 
forbids to commit anything on sorceforge except to the /silver directory.

I must say, it was a quite wise idea of Bill to create /silver as an 
exact copy of axiom--silver--1. View it as the opportunity to see 
(read-only) Tim's commits in SVN format.

In fact, there is no problem if /trunk is kept as a central place that 
is under Gaby's responsibility. And although I would find it sad, but if 
/trunk and /silver do not become one in the near future, there is no 
problem as long as it is clearly described which directory contains what.

I share your efficiency considerations, though. But up to now, it wasn't 
a big problem.

I think you miss the point here: you treat SCM like a backup device.
With such an attitude CVS should work fine for you... For me an
essential feature of SCM is ability to concisly and adeqatly summarize
differnces (managing changesets). Also, SCM is really a convenience
device for developers (note that in principle one can just just
a bunch of shell scripts as an SCM). In particular, checkout
should give "ready to build" sources. Now, in many cases
files containing '\r' will not work on Unix, OTOH without '\r'
the same files will not work on Windows.

In general, I do not like automatic convertions of line endings. But
IMHO SCM are an exception: usually there is clear separation
between binaries and text files, and since SCM stores metadata,
it can also store information about text/binary properties.
External tool would be forced to guess (and likely to be wrong).
I agree that that conversion should be done in client part of SCM.

I looked quickly at GIT, and I do not think it will be succeful
as-is.  It may "mature" and get extra functions present in other
SCM-s or alternatively some other "higher level SCM" may use
GIT as a backend. ATM the main strong point of GIT is its
packing algoritm, but alone that is too little to win.

you end up with N people having N branches, when in fact they want 1
common "true" live source to branch off.

But, I'm not going to insist since the idea of a common source
code that people can develop from and check-in lively is alien here.  
I have enough on the plate.  I'll finish build-improvements.  People
take what they want and I'll probably fork.

What I've seen with build-improvements is that people try it and find
problem, they propose fixes and if the fixes are correct they check
them in and everybody has it immediately.  The only time they have to
wait for me, is for review.  But if we have more "authorized" reviewers,
they would not have to wait for one single person.

There is a problem.  If Tim develops his stuff on one hand, and /trunk

I'm expecting to see more "Waldek"s coming in.  If there must be only
one Axiom source, then I would like to see their fixes go in as
quickly as possible (after clear review, that is).  And I would like
to see those changes spread as quickly as possible.  Also, you should
get in the habit of crediting developers responsabilities -- they should
commit themselves.  There are lots of things you learn that way :-)

I'm in the process of applying these patches. Do you know a situation where
readLibPathFast is used on a non existent file ? Since you prefer to remove
some assumptions, I want to know :-)

And again, thanks a lot,

Greg

PS : It was suggested to change the behavior of directoryp, I understand that
but I have seen code that relies on its actual behavior (for example in RDEFIOSTREAM).
I have seen too what can be considered duplicate code (directory?).

The prime example is if you forget to install USERS.DAASE or
DEPENDENTS.DAASE, even with probe-file problem resolved you
still get crash.

BTW 1: I would say that somebody making an assumption should justify
it (and the assumption is completly unjustified, as the pathname
does no error checking).

BTW 2: Expensive part of error checking in RDEFIOSTREAM is done
anyway, so there is no excuse to skip cheap error check.

BTW 3: IMHO the approach check first and then go on without checking
has fundamental problems, Unix way "try and check if OK" works
much better.

Based on your extensive work would you consider being the
person who maintains axiom--silver--1? That would settle
one of the items raised by Gaby.

Yes, however some clarificatinons are needed:

1) ATM I work with SVN on SourceForge and I hope to avoid contact
   with arch
2) "one of persons who maintain ..." -- IIUC Gaby wants to avoid
   single point of failure (me too).

Arch holds the master sources, which get mirrored everywhere, into
CVS on sourceforge and savannah, as well as SVN on sourceforge and
google. If you're not willing to do this because of arch then that's 
fine. I just thought that you were showing great initiative and might
find it worthwhile to try. Handling multiple SCMs would be the least
problem (currently axiom lives in arch, cvs, svn, and darcs).

The hard part is trying to figure out how to agree to things
that you disagree with because other people have perfectly
rational opinions. Working with arch is trivial. Working with
people is hard. And among them I'm probably one of the most painful.

How you maintain axiom--silver--1 would be up to you. Be aware
that about 22 people have write access to silver at the moment.

I don't think "single point of failure" is a rational notion
in terms of SCM. You or I could simply stop patching the code
and the world would hardly notice since many people have write
access.

A "single point of control", however, is vitally important.
You're basically "putting your name" on the dotted line 
claiming that you "control" the repository. If you allow
anyone to make any change they want you'll quickly find that
you have no idea what the changes mean and how they impact
the stability of "silver". That behavior is fine in a branch
but means chaos in the "pre-production" master copy. You 
can't track every person's "hot topic", nor have an instant
understanding of their "obviously correct patch".

You would need to think about how the changes will affect
many things including outstanding branches. Suppose
someone checks in Java Ant sripts to do builds instead of
using autoconf. Is that the best thing for the project?
Do we want to add Java as a global dependency? How do you
plan to resolve the Perl build mechanism with the current
mechanism? Or the build-improvements mechanism? Or suppose
someone renames files. What code depends on those files?
Does it break things we are not testing?

I am very careful about putting patches into silver until
I understand them. Silver patches are gold-to-be so its
not the same as maintaining a branch. You not only need
to apply the patch, you need to figure out how to check
that it is right and you need to figure out how to test
that it works. Thus a silver patch is very expensive.

Just because it works does not make it right for the project.

And you have to give strong pushback to maintain quality.
Changes and addtions NEED excellent documentation (not just
code changes). This will be the big discussion about getting
anything into gold in the future. 

It's a hard job and one that will put you in a position 
of contention with people at times.

Think carefully about it and let me know.

Tim

That's much easier than I expected. :-)

You only show running the Axiom main console program AXIOMsys.
How about the other parts of Axiom? If you type the command:

  $ axiom

You should see the hyperdoc window where you can browse the
Axiom library, run tutorial examples, search some documentation.
Does that work?

Note: We already suspect some possible errors in the display of
certain symbols in hyperdoc because of some mixed case file names,
e.g. Greek letters.

If you start Axiom as above and type the following Axiom command:

  (1) -> draw(sin x, x=0..2*%pi)

Does the Axiom graphics window open displaying the plot?

Finally, would you be willing to post a tarball of the Axiom
binaries distribution? You would create it like this:

  $ cd .../target
  $ tar czf powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0.tgz powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0

Then copy the tarball someplace where others can download it.

Thanks for giving this a try. As far as I know, you are only the
2nd person to ever report successfully running Axiom on a MAC!
:-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

aTx=b.bitmap
ATX=B.bitmap

(See list of unused bitmap files below.)

I think all .ps files that are not referenced in any *.pamphlet file
(such as SEGBIND.ps and segbind.ps) should be deleted from the /ps
directory.

Here is a quick hack to show which files in src/doc/ps are not
used in any src/doc/*.pamphlet file:

$ cd /home/page/axiom.build-improvements/src/doc
$ ls ps > ps_old
$ grep 'ps/.*\.ps.*}' *.pamphlet | \
  awk '{FS="ps/"; print substr($2,0,index($2,".ps")+2);}' | \
  sort | uniq > ps_new
$ diff --unified=0 ps_old ps_new | \
  awk '/^-[^-]/ { print substr($1,2)}'

2Dcos.ps
2Dsincos.ps
2Dsin.ps
atan-1.epsi
basic2d.ps
bessintr.eps
bessintr.epsi
h-browse.ps
h-condition.ps
h-crossref.ps
h-inverse.ps
h-matrixops1.ps
h-matrixops2.ps
h-matrix.ps
h-matusers.ps
h-opsearch.ps
h-origins.ps
h-parameter.ps
h-signature.ps
knot3.ps
P28a.eps
P28b.eps
segbind.ps
SEGBIND.ps
wd-atanz.ps
wd-bessi3.ps
wd-bessi3s.ps
wd-bessi.ps
wd-bessj.ps
wd-beta.ps
wd-expz.ps
wd-gammaz.ps

--------

Here is a similar hack for bitmaps:

$ cd 
$ ls ../bitmaps > bitmap_old
$ grep 'inputbitmap{\\htbmdir{}' * | \
  awk '{FS="{}/";print substr($2,1,index($2,"}}")-1)}' | \
  sort | uniq > bitmap_new
$ diff --unified=0 bitmap_old bitmap_new | \
  awk '/^-[^-]/ { print substr($1,2)}'

..."when their patches are approved"...

if the idea is tested in a branch
and if people feel it's a reasonable idea
and if there is a changeset from the branch to gold
the only remaining task is to make sure that the changeset
does not break other changesets that are already added to silver.

this responsibility should be the work of a single person
so that there is a focal point for coordinating discussion.
if two perfectly good branches make incompatible changes to silver
which one wins and who has to redo their changeset?

one person has total control over the whole source tree in their branch,
such as you have with build-improvements. why isn't it reasonable to
have one person coordinating silver? 

there are a lot of "other tasks" besides checking in changes 
that need to be performed in order to keep a silver version.
who would have the responsibility to do this?

Actually, both. 

The check-in needs to be reviewed before it is committed back to the
axiom--silver--1 branch to make sure it doesn't break other pending
changes.

The check-in needs to be reviewed after it is committed by the author
to make sure their changes are all correctly applied and by the silver
maintainer to make sure that nothing broke.

| 
| s/Xi.bitmap/xi-cap.bitmap/
| s/Upsilon.bitmap/upsilon-cap.bitmap/
| s/Theta.bitmap/theta-cap.bitmap/
| s/Sigma.bitmap/sigma-cap.bitmap/

| s/Omega.bitmap/omega-cap.bitmap/

I agree.

How do we determine that they are referenced at run-time through
dynamic generation of their names?
It is because we know no such things exist?

Before deletion, we have to determine that they are not referenced at
runtime through name generation on the fly.  Do you know whether that
can ever happen?

Of course your offer was sincere and with good intentions. But since
Tim cant or wont solve his problems with using svn, that would have
meant that he would have had to send his patches to you manually in
addition to recording the changes in his own tla axiom--silver--1
repository. Or alternatively you would have had to learn how to use
arch (tla). Obviously that arrangement was not working.

Yes I agree in principle, however there is a technical problem so
long as Tim insists on using arch (tla): There is no available
automatic synchronization program from svn to tla, but it does work
in the other direction. This would mean that changes committed to
svn would not automatically be made to axiom--silver--1 and would
again rely on Tim to try to manually keep axiom--silver--1 in sync.
This also was not working.

This technical problem could be solved if Tim were to convert to
using another more current repository software, e.g. GIT with which
is can do a two-way sync. (Or of course, if we all agreed to use
exactly one type of repository!)

Absolutely correct. I am sorry if I was not clear on that.

In fact I do I agree with you. But projects like Axiom are about
people as well as technology. Sometimes we need to do things to
accommodate other people no matter how awkward that makes the
process.

Well awkward, yes, but I don't see it as a waste of time or of
resources. The most limited resource for Axiom right now is people
with knowledge of how Axiom works. It seems that we might have to
do some extraordinary things in order to retain all of these "eggs"
in one basket... :-)

I do not know that they are not referenced at run-time through
dynamic generation of their names, however given what I know about
this programs it seems very unlikely to me.

I do not know and I think it might be prohibitive in time to examine
the code in sufficient detail to ensure that this is not the case but
it seems to me the benefits of cleaning up this mess out weight the
risk, especially since these files are among the problematic binary
and mixed-case files in the distribution.

Here is one suggestion: For now we could just move all of the "unused"
files that I listed in my previous email to temporary location in the
source tree. The recent improvements to hyperdoc made by Waldek suggest
that now would be a good time in any case to have Axiom users focus
more attention on this part of the system. If problems of missing
files occur, it should be difficult to document which of the presumed
"unused" files is actually referenced dynamically (if any).

Bill Page.

You're not going to require people to create a branch for *every
single* patch, right?

[...]

For that matter, I feel the control of branches should be shared

Please be more specific, so that I can offer meaningful answer.

Only because you have introduced an unnecessary step.

Patch is reviewed, and accepted.  Author has the responsability to
check in as approved.  Period.

Now, if you introduce that walk-around, people have to check that you
did not mess up their changes.  This is compounded by the fact that we
know of this changes only after a day, when possibly other changes
have been applied too.  Remove the unnecessary step; make the source
live.

In this case, it wasn't "the only possible solution", but it was an

I agree.  I subscribe to your suggestion to move "unused" files to a

idea == patch? surely you jest.
you clearly don't think that's a reasonable sentence or 
you would not have organized build-improvements the way you did.

please lose the notion of "single point of failure" as it is meaningless.
the axiom sources exist in a dozen places and are freely writeable by
two dozen people. a sudden heart attack on my part would have little
if any effect on axiom development.

well, answering related email would be one :-)

or you left out an important step. even programs do this in several
steps with different responsibilities. think of databases. when you
insert or modify a record there are pre-scripts and post-scripts that
run to validate the change even though you claim it is correct.
sometimes a change you make gets rejected for reasons you didn't expect.

so if you add build improvements as a changeset and i add an ant
build-xml as a changeset who is responsible for mediating the
breakage?  we both have our reasons. you want BI because it follows
standard GNU practice. i want ant because i've written java-based
regression testing (no, i haven't written such a thing).

it is really a separation-of-concerns issue.  every author has a

think of it as a human-mediated "svn merge" with rationality.
the machine may think the changeset is ok but not the human.

if we're developing literate programs for the humans rather than
patch files for the machine somebody has to review the result.
you wouldn't expect a conference chair to allow anyone to submit
a paper without review, nor are they allowed to change it after
it has been accepted.

silver came into being in response to your requests.
a silver-maintainer leader is also in response to your requests.
methinks you're making your points.

As you probably realized, I don't require people to create a branch
off build-improvements just to provide a patch.  right?  

build-improvements is a substantial work; consequently, it needs a
branch.  However, when a dependency rule is missing (as evidenced by
patch to this list), it would very bureaucratuic and inefficient use of
resources to require people to branch of build-improvements just to
provide a branch to correct the missing dependency.  I hope you get
the point.

Please, don't be afraid to be more *specific*.

If something is missing from the patch, then it must be discussed on
the list; have the author take care of it instead of you having
conversation with yourself, mangling the patches and require author
that what you applied did not go beyond reason.  The only exception I
can think of this is that of automatically generated files that need
not be included in the patch (case in point configure.ac -> configure).

But, again that should not be your responsability of mangling
patches and have people check that the applied mangling is correct.

| so if you add build improvements as a changeset and i add an ant
| build-xml as a changeset who is responsible for mediating the
| breakage? 

Please don't be afraid of the specific breakage so that we work out
the details.   

If build-improvements changeset goes in first, then you have to take
that into account in preparing your following patch that you don't
break existing semantics without good reasons.  If build-xml goes in
first then it is my responsability to make sure that I don't break
existing semantics without good reasons.  That procedure is not
different from any other patches.  It is a no-brainer.

| regression testing (no, i haven't written such a thing).
| 
| it is really a separation-of-concerns issue.  every author has a
| vested interest in making sure his changeset is accepted.

Not only that.  Every author has the responsability of making sure
that his changes does not break the whole system and does not prevent
further progress of the whole system.  It is not an individual-thing.
It is a collective product. 

|  but the
| owner of the silver branch is responsible for making sure that ALL
| changesets are checked.

The owner of silver branch has to make sure that the whole system does
not fall apart.  For this to be workable, he has to make sure that
every contribution is made to the point that the whole system is still
coherent.  But, that does not imply that he has the burden and
responsability to mangle patches and afterward has people guess what
was done is faithful to their ideas.  Rather, it should be explained
to the contributors how their contributions should be structured to
ensure that the whole system is functionning, so that others can
contribute too.

| Further, the silver owner has to deal with
| convincing me that the changes should get accepted into gold.

That is a very different issue.

that is an interesting analogy, but:

  (2) for an anology to be meaningful, you have to explain how Axiom
      relates  a conference and why that analogy is sound to lead to
      any meaningful conclusion.

well, this is your claim.
i claim such a single point does not exist.
you claim it does exist.
it is much harder to prove non-existence of a non-point
so i invite you to go first. 
state where. 
be specific.
prove your claim that a single failure destroys the project.
show your work. :-)

| silver came into being in response to your requests.

No, I did not ask the creation of silver.  I requested you make your
changes public and live -- before they move to gold.  What is
currently called silver is not what I requested.  I did not request a
repository that is effectively read-only.

At the risk of repeating myself, let me more specific:

  (1) make your changes live and not just read-only.
  (2) in particular, make it possible that we all see the patches
      applied (not just a message "patch --xxx" is available).
  (3) make the master repository under SVN.  This the "main" source
      which which expriments, including releases are made of.
  (4) commit changes to the master repository before they go do gold.
  (6) have more than just one maintainer.

Go back to the discussion in March-April 2006; which of those points
were not already made?

A single point of failure is when we have only one person

  (1) that has authority to approve and apply changes to the main source,
  (2) make official realeases.

   When that single person becomes unavailable temporarily or forever,
   the project is stalled.

Do you want to be remind you how late --patch-50 was?

They're not read-only. Search the CHANGELOG file for 'gdr' and
you'll see that you have made changes. It is just that my review 
is part of the change process.

All patches are posted to the list.

All patches to silver get automatically posted due to Bill's robot.

No, SVN is not the "main" source. Arch is. SVN was created at your
request and now you insist that it become the "main" source. This
has not been the case for the last 5 years and won't be the case
for the forseeable future. One key argument is that several developers
from this list other than myself have experienced problems with SVN.

SVN is fine for "experiments" and developers. It is NOT the release site,
never was, and is not planned as such. Arch has gold which gets published
every couple months with changes mirrored to savannah and sourceforge.
We've been doing that for many years.






>   (4) commit changes to the master repository before they go do gold.

They are committed to the master repository... axiom--silver--1
with changes that are pending in the next gold release. Multiple
direct changes to the master tree are not appropriate.

As an example, the most recent case of removing "duplicate" filenames
in the debugsys image was proposed. The change seems simple and
obvious and did not break the build-improvements branch. However, a
careful review of the change before accepting it into silver found it
to be incorrect.






>   (6) have more than just one maintainer.

There are 22 maintainers for Arch, 6 people with complete admin access
on savannah, and 3 people (including yourself) with complete admin
access on sourceforge.






Ulitmately we differ on philosophy. I believe that each branch
has one person ultimately responsible for that branch. The responsible
person determines policy. 

You are responsible for build-improvements and allow multiple changes
directly to the sources. That is appropriate for development software.

I am responsible for gold and silver and don't allow multiple changes
to the sources. That is appropriate for final release of software.

That is a single point of control, not a single point of failure.
Axiom has a single point of control, one per branch and one per
silver and gold.

I don't recall that everyone was required to stop development.

And, indeed, life intervenes. The project was not stalled though
because I spent time getting a hundred copies of Axiom built and
handed out at the ISSAC conference. The result of this time gained
us (hopefully) access to Manuel's work and a few other connections
to other people in our target audience.

Right. Gold=axiom--main--1 only gets patches every two months.
The gold-to-be=axiom--silver--1 is the branch that Tim commits to in 
order to prepare the next gold.

In my understanding we requested that in order to let axiom-developers 
see how the current gold gradually develops into the next gold. We all 
agreed that Tim commits to gold. Since now that thing is called 
axiom--silver--1 does not change that.

axiom--silver--1 is mirrored on sourceforge /silver and is where people 
should branch from (which is currently not done because /trunk and 
/silver exist simultaneously).

Up to now silver in the form of axiom--silver--1 is maintained by Tim to 
assure quality for the next gold release.

build-improvements has been branched from (a not so perfect copy of) 
silver (which was actually gold=axiom--main--1--patch-49 at that time, 
if I remember correctly).

I haven't yet completely understood how Gaby wants the development 
process. Gaby certainly has quite a lot of experience with development 
on gcc. So we all would be happy to learn.

Gaby, could you post how you think Axiom development should work? (You 
should probably avoid the usage of Gold/silver/bronze.) Just post your 
dream. Where should be the main source? How many stages should be there 
before something is released? How is quality ensured? What _roles_ (not 
persons) should be responsible for what.

Actually, I should ask the same from Tim, but I have the impression I 
somehow already understand his model.

Only if we have a clear picture what the options are, we can discuss how 
we clear the current confusion or how we agree on another development model.

I found the discussion up to now not very fruitful. To me it seemed that 
it is still not clear what Silver actually is. I also have the 
impression that Gaby wanted something else when he opted to maintain 
Silver. Names can sometimes be misleading and I think this is now what 
we have. Tim-Silver is not the intention of Gaby-Silver.

So please Gaby, try to make clear what you like even if you have already 
said that several times before. We must somehow settle the problem that 
you and Tim obviously have different understanding of "Silver".

Ralf

| They're not read-only.

silver in its current state is effectively read-only:  If I commit
changes there, you don't get it automatically the next time you update
your local tree -- because you're using a different source-base. You
have to go and mangle it and have me check it what you mangled is what
I intended.

| 
| All patches are posted to the list.

I have not seen you posting changes to the list.  I've however seen
messages saying that "patch --xxx"" is available.

| All patches to silver get automatically posted due to Bill's robot.

Only a day after, and not all changes are propagated; it seems.
One reason for sending the patches as *you* apply to silver as is that
they get more eyes to review it and test it than you would do on your
own.  Case in point is the the recent change that broke Vanuxem's code.  

[...]

| 
| No, SVN is not the "main" source. Arch is. SVN was created at your
| request and now you insist that it become the "main" source. This

Since I do not want to get into the revisionism business, I went to
the archive in April 2006 to see what the discussion was.

In this message:

  http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-04/msg00057.html

you said:

   If any other developer feels the desire to maintain their own SVN
   branch this can also be set up on sourceforge. You can use this
   for 'public development' if you like.  
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

and after the creation of the SVN repository, you wrote in message:

  http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-04/msg00054.html


  [...]

  The SVN version is expected to be used as a hotpatch 'latest change' version. 
  The CVS version will still track the Arch. 
  On a best-effort, two-month interval I'll look to merge the changes
  from the Sourceforge/SVN to the Arch/Sourceforge CVS/Savannah CVS.

How can that be meaningfully for "public development", expected to
be used as a hotpatch 'latest change' version,  and not the main
source?  It looks to me that you just negated everything with the
recent development of silver.

I summarized the rationale of request here

  http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-04/msg00043.html

as

   * instant availability of patches applied to mainline

   * public informative review that helps gain understanding of why
     things are the way they are, possible improvements, and things
     that should not be tried.  That is very essential to attain
     critical mass of people understanding the system.

     I've learnt a lot about Axiom through discussions between you,
     Tim and others. I think that should happen more often, on patches
     -- not just in abstract ;-)

| has not been the case for the last 5 years and won't be the case
| for the forseeable future. One key argument is that several developers
| from this list other than myself have experienced problems with SVN.

Please let be more specific about the "several developers" and discuss
what the issues really are and how they are representative and should
constitute key argument.   
>From what I've seen:

  (1) there is a problem with *SF* SVN setup
  (2) the axiom systems contain many ill-formed protability constructs
      and assumptions exposed by using SVN.

| SVN is fine for "experiments" and developers. It is NOT the release site,

For release, there should be *official tarballs*, not just --patch-xxx
under repo XYZ.

[...]

| 
| They are committed to the master repository... axiom--silver--1

| direct changes to the master tree are not appropriate.
| 
| As an example, the most recent case of removing "duplicate" filenames

I see you have carefully constructed a very deformed idea of the patch
-- it was not about removing duplicate "filenames" as explained many
times. 

| in the debugsys image was proposed. The change seems simple and

And it was a very good thing that we had that review in public
"instantly", instead of waiting that it is published days later buried
with other changes.  The outcome of the review was a better
documentation of the relations between several components and
unwritten assumptions.  That is Good and that is why silver patches to
silver should be sent to the list and when applied made instantly
available to the community.

But, by your very words, if the main source is not SF, then it is
pointless that you have three people with complete admin access to SF
-- whether that included me or not.  That is the point.  Don't just
count.  Count right.

We most certainly differ on philosophy. But obviously you don't see
exactly how we differ.  So, it probably is better when you speak for
your philosophy you don't attempt to denature mine.

I believe we need a stable branch (gold), and it should be made
available, live just as any other branches.  Made live means that
changes to that branch are immediately available to everybody; instead
of being kept secret and suddenly released to the world when time
permits. 
Made live does not imply that people makes applies changes willy nilly.

We should make sure that things are setup so that eventually, more
people understand the system, in particular gold and attain the point
where we don't just have one person on which everything depends.

Hello Waldek,

You are one of the most active developers currently. You should 
definitely put an entry on

| That is a single point of control, not a single point of failure.

when the control fails to function properly, the development of system
fails to progress. By implication, the "point of control" is a "point
of failure".

the availability of the newer version wwas delayed, and nobody else

thanks God, nobody blames you for that.  But, it did happen.

As you mention build-improvements; let me point out that I would very
much like to see more people involved, capable of making changes to
the "right" directions so that I do not become a single point of failure.
So, in case you would be under the impression I would like a single
maintainership on build-improvements and question that of gold and
silver, be assure it is not the case.  I've repeated it enough.
And I hope we've gotten build-improvements out of the way.

That is the current situation as it has been set recently.  
I'm not sure that was the situation in April 2006 when we set up the
framework.  At the time, I believe there was something called silver
(and its implications), which is not what is currently called silver.

Yes, we all agreed that Tim commits to gold; yes.  
If gold is now called silver, what is gold?

Ideally, I would like to see a *main common source tree* (call it
Trunk) from which everything develops.

On a regular bases, we branch off Trunk to make release branches.  For
example, we could decide that next Tuesday, we will branch off for
Axiom 4.1.0.  A release branch from Trunk will be created for that
purpose. That branch will have stricter rules for checking than for
Trunk.  For example, we would not fiddle with/upgrade GCL versions
there.  Only bug fixes will be applied to release branches.  After the
initial major release from that branch, we will be making minor
releases from there, say Axiom 4.1.3 that are only regression bug
fixes. (Ideally, we should not have regressions, but that happens only
in dream, especially with with impenetrable systems).

In parallel, Trunk develops its life.  Any bug fixes to release
branches (that also happen to be present on Trunk) must first be
tested on Trunk before being applied to a release branch.
Trunk is less restricted than release branches in the sense that it
contains "experimental" phases where more features are added [say we
have drag-n-drop, integration of ACL, SPAD understands dependent
types, or we get rid of ')abbrev' command to introduce types, or that
SPAD understands "extend" for extending domains, etc.]  This is
usually the time where development branches are merged to trunk.
Then, there should be a period where we make "pause" in the feature
accretion, stabilize for release purposes, then branch off for the
next major release (say 4.2.0).

People will create experimental branches from Trunk.  There are
well-defined rules about how an experimental branch gets merged to
Trunk.  No experimental branch gets merged to an existing release
branch. 

During the process, we should try to do everything possible to
increase the number of people that understands the system.  This
includes, better documentation.  Even those who understand the system
should justify their changes.  People should apply their patches
directly, instead of going through a single person.  The sources
should be immediately available. 
We should use less superstition, e.g. "don't touch because it
currently works."  Trunk should be open to move more aggressively in its
"experimental" phase.  Release branches, must be conservative.

Notice that in my model, no changes get merged to a release branch if
it is not a regression bug fix.  Any new functionality should appear
in the next major release.  Everything is publically available in a
lively fashion.  The most stable branch (to serve a release source)
and the main Trunk. 

To my mind, we can have many repo if that is felt necessary, but: only
one repo is the master, others are mirrors to simplify our lives.

Now, I understand that is not what we have; I'm trying to see how it
can be approximated and made to work.

'aTx=b' is referenced from 'nag-f04.boot.pamphlet' (among others).
For ATX=B.bitmap you are probably right.

ATM we use only few .ps files. However there are many commented out 
references in the axiom book, that is files we should use but
for some reason (problems with flat environment???) we do not use
them now. There is a lot of junk: files that do not show up in
ghostscript at all, files which probably have bogus boundig box,
duplicates. We can easily recreate graphs, screenshots need
more work to recreate and a few files (probably 2 or 3) are
"original artwork". In ideal world sombody would sort the
.ps files into "valuable" (needing some/lot of effort to recreate),
"cache" (the ones which we put in the distribution, but can
easily recreate) and junk. But in short term mass deletion
may be the best solution.

You missed '.eps' endinig:

P28a.eps is very special, because it actually shows in the book :)

> Here is a similar hack for bitmaps:
> 

You missed references from the browser:

> s21bdf1.bitmap

This one is "used":

nag-s.boot.pamphlet:  htInitPage("S21BDF - Symmetrised Elliptic Integral of 3rd
Kind \space{1} \vspace{-28} \inputbitmap{\htbmdir{}/s21bdf1.bitmap}", nil)

I think that finding unused bitmaps need some more work: it seems that
some references to bitmaps appear without file suffix, also because of
quoting rules some names appear mangled.  OTOH I think it is safe bet
that browser do not access '.ps' files from 'src/doc/ps'. First, 
browser do not have support for showing '.ps' files, and while
ANNA-ES.ht contains (commented out) call to ghostscript it seem to be
the only case. Second, it seems that browser were supposed to access
only files from 'share' subtree and that files from 'src/doc/ps'
were not installed here.

	Hi Humberto,

	And thanks for providing this binary!
	My machine is a Dual G5 running OS X 10.4.8 (PPC build 8L127, =
Darwin =20
Kernel Version 8.8.0, PowerMac7,2 Darwin similar to your =20
configuration I think...)  and your binary worked here too!  Great!!


	In fact I tried earlier to repeat your manipulations to compile =
from =20
source and could repeat the second part (use adacs to get axiom =20
source and so on) but the first part (install gcl) didn't work here...

	The gcl generation ends (depending on paths and/or parameter) =
with =20
either a gcl readline error :
gcl_readline.d: In function 'rl_completion':
gcl_readline.d:221: warning: implicit declaration of function =20
'rl_completion_matches'
gcl_readline.d:221: error: 'rl_compentry_func_t' undeclared (first =20
use in this function)
gcl_readline.d:221: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported =20
only once
gcl_readline.d:221: error: for each function it appears in.)
gcl_readline.d:221: error: parse error before ')' token

	or the more annoying tk problem :
/usr/bin/ld: warning -L: directory name (/sw/src/tcltk-8.4.6-2/=20
tk8.4.6/unix) does not exist
/usr/bin/ld: warning multiple definitions of symbol _tclPlatStubsPtr =20
and others...
/usr/bin/ld: Undefined symbols:
_my_free
_my_malloc
	(at this point there was a usable saved_gcl but...)

	I did this (and some variants without --disable-nls or the =
export =20
line and so on...) :

	Get a working gcl with CVS :
	export CVS_RSH=3Dssh
	export CVSROOT=3D:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sv.gnu.org:/sources/gcl
	cvs -z9 -q co -d gcl-2.6.8pre -r Version_2_6_8pre gcl

	In gcl-2.6.8pre :
	- remove  -lintl  from the LIBS:=3D line of  =
h/powerpc-macosx.defs

  	export LIBRARY_PATH=3D`pwd`/binutils/intl
	./configure --enable-locbfd --disable-statsysbfd --disable-nls
	make=09

	With the results previously given...

	Do you see something inappropriate in the previous lines or =
could =20
you give me the commands you used to successfully compile gcl on PPC?


	In any case many thanks again for your binary!
				Raymond

Arch in itself is not big problem. But I belive that development
will take place in SVN and I prefer to be there. Also, I misunderstood
your message: my first impression was that you argeed with Gaby
critique and wanted to implement one of his proposals.

Maybe "single person bottleneck" is better term.  If key person
on a project say "I stop working on a project", this is bad but
the project has good chance to survive.  If key person is slow
responding ("I will do that next week", "Sorry, I forgot aboy this")
at first the effects look harmless, but this can easily kill
the project.

Tim, I have some experience managing software relases and have
my views what high quality means and how to attain it.  And
frankly, my views differ from current Axiom practice.  I thought
that your proposal is part of establishing new practice
-- I see now that I again misundrestood you.

You should be able to find explanation of you problem in Google. 
Yesterday searching (IIRC) for

readline BSD 

I have found message stating that Apple ships BSD 'libedit' library
which in partial (but incomplete) replacement for 'readline'.  What
is worse Apple istalls symbolic link from 'readline.dynlib' to
'libedit.dynlib' so that programs which want to use GNU 'readline'
end up using 'libedit' -- in many cases leading to errors like
above.  The message described what configure has to do to distingush
'libedit' from true 'readline', but I do not remember details.

I made a minor name-edit to your text to reflect my understanding
of the current situation. s/trunk/silver/ and s/release/gold/

It seems your model differs from the current model in only one
truly essential aspect. You feel that I'm a bottleneck and that
Axiom cannot develop properly if a single person is in charge
of the final version. You feel that this limits what people can do
and that I'm holding back Axiom development. You feel that such a
centralized "point of failure" cannot work.

Linux is developed with this same centralized model.
Linus controls all of the things that get accepted, essentially GOLD.
Andrew Morton controls his version of the kernel, essentially SILVER.
Linus and Andrew are both "points of failure". Indeed Linus is 
regularly flamed on the kernel mailing list for his decisions
(e.g. to use BitKeeper, to write GIT, to reject ReiserFS, etc).
It is stated regularly that he's holding back Linux, that he's
a control freak, that he's arbitrary and misguided and that the
central model of development cannot work. Axiom uses the same
model and you're making the same arguments.





Gaby, at this point we've raised every question and answer.
What remains unsettled is my role in the development process.

I'd like to hear from the other people lurking on this list.
What is your opinion. Try to speak freely and clearly.
My feelings will not be hurt so don't mince words.

Tim

I think these are both symptoms of the gcl configure picking up packages
from fink (/sw/bin, /sw/lib, ...) and having the compile break.

You don't need that anymore if you patch, as we won't use libintl anymore=
=2E

I manipulated my PATH to remove /sw/bin and similar, so gcl's configure
doesn't see the fink tcl/Tk, I think you can pass some kind of configure
option to gcl to do the same thing, but I kept having wierd problems
until I changed the PATH.

In any case, I used fink's latex and pdflatex for the gcl documentation
build, so you could try something like:

PATH=3D/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin
=2E/configure --enable-locbfd --disable-statsysbfd --disable-nls

all on one line. Good luck.

| I made a minor name-edit to your text to reflect my understanding
| of the current situation. s/trunk/silver/ and s/release/gold/
| 
| It seems your model differs from the current model in only one
| truly essential aspect. You feel that I'm a bottleneck and that

I believe your edit probably reflects your ideas, but I do not believe
you represented the differences in our approaches correctly, in particular
I believe it is a mischaracterization to think the essential
difference is being you in charge of the release branches.
Consequently, let me go over again, before going on family life.

The model I presented, and your edits do not reflect existing
practice.  Notice that in my model, release branches are made from
Trunk (your SILVER) on a *regular basis* to make a new major release.
After that, the release branches continue their lives as minor release
for regression bug fixes only.  That is not the current model.

In my model, the Trunk (yoru SILVER) has phases were it is more
experimental and more aggressive in capabilities.  After such an
experimental phase, it goes into stabilization, then branch for a new
major release.

In my model, all branches, including release and Trunk are "live".

Try to work out those points.  If you believe you agree with them, we
wouold have agreed on the essential aspects.  And we would have made a
major change.  

But, please, refrain your presenting the essential differences as you
just did.  

Don't base decisions on mischaracterizations.

I patched src/graph/sselect.c.pamphlet (well, first I patched the .c
file, but I wised up before mailing the patch, shouldn't notangle mangle
line numbers in C sources so they point at the pamphlets?)

I guess Macs have BSD style signals:

AXIOMsys doesn't need X support does it? I'm going to try to rebuild gcl
without X support and build a new axiom from it. Is there an equivalent
to the linux ldd command on Mac OS? On linux, ldd lists out the dynamic
libraries used by a program.

I think there is another solution, in XCode, I can specify what kind of
project to build, and one of the options is (I think) a binary that is
compatible with OS X 10.2 or later (I don't know if it's static or uses
compatibility libraries). It may be possible to pass flags to the
command line tools to achieve the same thing. I'll ask around

AXIOMsys is just a pure lisp image and only requires a command line.

I really can't say. I'm not well versed in using a MAC for development.

Well, here's the old AXIOMsys:

neverblows:~/src/working humberto$ strings
=2E./axiom-darcs/target/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0/bin/AXIOMsys |grep '\.d=
ylib'
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXt.6.dylib
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXmu.6.dylib

/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
/usr/X11R6/lib/libICE.6.dylib
/usr/lib/libedit.2.dylib
/usr/X11R6/lib/libSM.6.dylib

/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib
/usr/X11R6/lib/libX11.6.dylib
/usr/X11R6/lib/libXaw.7.dylib

and here's the new gcl I just built:

neverblows:~/src/working humberto$ strings unixport/saved_gcl |grep
'\.dylib'
/usr/lib/libedit.2.dylib
/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib

Hopefully, the AXIOMsys I built with this gcl will work.

http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~humberto/axiom-ppc-2006110401.tar.gz

The configure invocation for GCL is:

regex.h is not a plug-in replacemnt for regexp.h -- the headers are
incompatible.  In prarticular regexp.h declares functions 'compile',
'step' and variable 'loc2' while interface exported by 'regex.h'
is quite different.

AFAICS we should rewrite hthits.c to use regex.h on all platforms,
but this slightly more then changing include line.

This patch has been added to silver. 
I'm not sure about the hyper changes. 
I need to investigate further.

The patch below converts hthits to use 'regexp.h'.  The <sys/types.h>
include is correct on Linux, but may need adjustment on Mac.

Thanks Waldek, that patch worked perfectly. Now that's what I call
distributed development, you're writing code for a system you don't even
have :-).

axiom is now processing a bunch of input files like:

p:POLY PF 7 :=3D6*x +6*y +6*z +x^49+y^49+z^49


         49         49         49
   (1)  z   + 6z + y   + 6y + x   + 6x
                                                Type: Polynomial
PrimeField 7
factor p

I'm waiting for it to finish to upload another tarball, with sman and
hypertex and the other tools.

There still isn't a working gcl for Intel Mac OS X, I started mangling
the source to support "--enable-machine=3Di386-macosx", but it's still no=
t
working. Configure thinks my mac is "i686-apple-darwin8.8.1", as opposed
to the G5 which is "powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0". I don't think there will
ever be a i386 Apple Mac, so we may as well decide to call the machine
"i686-macosx" instead.

I think we should use "--disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd --disable-x
--disable-xgcl --disable-nls", those are the flags I used on the
external gcl I have that built axiom sucessfully. The
"--disable-tkconfig" should help with the Tcl/Tk issues we've been
having. What are the memory and custreloc flags for?

	Thanks for the trick of isolating Fink (/sw/... by default) and =20=

DarwinPort (/opt/local/...).
	It worked indeed with exactly these instructions!
	I just added two symbolic links in /usr/local/bin : the first =
since =20
pdflatex was needed for completion of the make and the second =20
(optional) for .dvi generation of the make install :

cd /usr/local/bin	=09
ln -s /sw/bin/pdflatex pdflatex
ln -s /sw/bin/tex tex

	make
	sudo make install

	installed gcl so that I could start the (very long...) axiom =20
compilation (NRLIBS generation)

	I got the SIGCLD errors and applied your corrections :

in sselect.c.pamphlet and viewman.c.pamphlet replace :
#if defined(BSDplatform)
by
#if defined(BSDplatform) || defined(MACOSXplatform)

	I got stuck with the hyper problem :
13 making /Users/raym/Desktop/dev/axio/axiom/src/hyper
make[2]: *** No rule to make target `addfile.pamphlet', needed by =20
`addfile.h'.  Stop.
make[1]: *** [hyper/stamp] Error 2
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
	I fear there is an order problem here since the hthits.pamphlet =20=

doesn't exist in the 'hyper' folder at this point (as opposed to the =20
older axiom projects I have).

	I'll stop here (it's late in France).

	Thanks again for the help (I don't forget Tim, Bill, Aurelien =
and =20
many others!)
	Best regards,
				Raymond

With Waldek's latest patches it looks like the build completed. I've put
a tarball up:

http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~humberto/axiom-ppc-2006110402.tar.gz

but I'm pretty sure something's broken. xlogo works from the PPC to my
home, but HyperDoc can't connect to the X server:

ptyopen: Failed to open /dev/ptmx: No such file or directory
ptyopen failed: No such file or directory
(HyperDoc) Cannot connect to the X11 server!

Sorry, I have to check if darcs overwrote the openpty patches.

The tarfile contains the powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0 directory that should
be the target of the AXIOM variable:

tar zxf axiom-ppc-2006110402.tar.gz
export AXIOM=3D`pwd`/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0
PATH=3D$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
AXIOMsys

should work at least on PowerPC Mac OS X 10.4 systems.

Maybe you can write the instructions down to build on MAC PPC on the wiki.

Maybe in here (Bill can probably say a better location):

Yes on both accounts.  Those are what were in the Makefiles when I
branched.  I never committed my changes to that.  The test should be
based on the target canonical triplet.

| There still isn't a working gcl for Intel Mac OS X, I started mangling
| the source to support "--enable-machine=i386-macosx", but it's still not
| working. Configure thinks my mac is "i686-apple-darwin8.8.1", as opposed

| "i686-macosx" instead.

I would like to see GCL (and therefore Axiom) use the canonical
triplet.  That creates less opportunities for confusion.  
Furthermore, I think --enable-machine should be dropped in favor of
the standard and traditional --target.

| I think we should use "--disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd --disable-x
| --disable-xgcl --disable-nls", those are the flags I used on the
| external gcl I have that built axiom sucessfully. The
| "--disable-tkconfig" should help with the Tcl/Tk issues we've been
| having. What are the memory and custreloc flags for?

We don't need Tcl/Tk -- that was observed by Vanuxem a while ago.

Thanks for noticing this Alfredo. Yes I think that is a good idea
so I just modified it as you suggested, except that I changed the
link Executables to Programs instead of deleting it since some
people seem to miss the fact that the headings are in fact also
links.

Both AxiomBinaries and AxiomSources link to BuildAxiom. Do you mean
you think there should still be a link to it directly from FrontPage?

I agree that BuildAxiom is the right place to add the build procedure
for OS X. Feel free ... :-)

I don't think there has been any recent work. I updated the build
instructions last month and tested building Axiom using the new
gcl-2.6.8pre release. It works but I did not have time to make
any improvements to the existing Windows binaries. I am still
planning (real-soon-now) to start a new build for Windows based
on the new build-improvements branch... That shouldn't be any
harder than it turned out to be for the MAC! :-)

Do you have any interest in working on the Windows version?

Regards,
Bill Page

I will be done with my midterms this week, so I will have time finally
to work on a new Doyen CD (with the Sage goodies), but Axiom on
Windows sounds like a fun project :-).

It would be nice to have the Linux, OS X and Windows binaries on the livecd.

Bill, Alfredo,

I might suggest that we reorganize a portion of the axiom binary
page to use a table form. I placed a mockup at

http://daly.axiom-developer.org/axiombinary

That way we can not only keep track of which binaries are current
for a given platform but we can provide release notes (e.g. windows
does not currently support graphics).

We could also keep the Doyen in the list.

Opinions?

Bill,

Did you ever add the asq setup?
I don't see it anywhere.

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomBinaries

The page does need some reorganization.

Something similar to your table concept, I was thinking of having
at the beginning of the page some kind of index like:

Axiom Binaries

1. Linux
2. Debian
3. Fedora
4. Redhat
5. OS X (PPC)
6. OS X (Intel)
7. Windows

and so on, being each of these links to its specific "level" or section
in the same page, with the proper explanation about the binary
for that particular platform:

2. OS X(PPC)

The Axiom binary file for the........

I do not know if this makes sense or I dont know if you would prefer
to have individual pages for each platform.

well, clearly i think the table organization is clearer :-)
the advantage is that you can see at a glance which binaries
are available, which are downlevel, and which are missing.
that way we can direct efforts at making binaries.

entries in the table can point to the same binaries if they
work across multiple platforms so there is no need for a
page per table entry.

we could even color code the table entries for "partial",
"experimental branch", "silver" and "gold" versions so it
would be possible to have multiple versions per platform.

but then, where are the release notes going to be placed?

That sounds interesting.

place the release note link in the same box as the binary thus:

Sorry, last time when I tried to update wiki (different page) it
did not work -- I typed in all that silly info which 'preferences'
want to gather but it still did not work.

I proposed removing several files from Axiom repository.  ATM only
Gaby commented on some files.  

Here is updated list:

files unused both in silver and in build-improvements, up to date
copies are created during build process:

 src/share/algebra/comdb.text
 src/share/algebra/libdb.text
 src/share/algebra/DEPENDENTS.DAASE
 src/share/algebra/USERS.DAASE
 src/interp/libdb.text
 src/interp/temp.text

files created during build process, but version from repo is referenced
form Makefiles ('src/algebra/libdb.text' is unused in build-improvements):
 src/algebra/libdb.text
 src/hyper/pages/ht.db
 src/share/algebra/gloss.text
 
duplicate, referenced from Makefile (removal needs Makefile changes):
 src/share/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht

generated documentation files:

 src/doc/bookvol1.pdf

I would give high priority to removing extra copy of 'util.ht', since
'util.ht' contains paths to files which we need to rename.

Since the process relies on at least 3 patches to gcl and axiom that are
being incorporated into the development sources I'd rather wait.

Hopefully in a few days we can say the instructions will be:

$ svn co
https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements \
                axiom.build-improvements

$ cd axiom.build-improvements
$ ./configure
$ make

Send it to me then, I'll do it for you. The page should actually still 
be editable by everyone, but I also realized that sometimes I am asked 
for a password even if I entered a "Reason for change". But fortunately, 
I have a password.

Unless I'm misremebring, someone suggested that there might a slight

would be good to merge the content (with expalanation as usual) and
remove it.

this call is slighlty harder.  We don't generate PDFs at the moment
(but we should), and this is a copy of a book already published.  So
the question is how "authentic" we want the copy in SVN to be.
Personnaly, I would go for its complete deletion, augment the build
machinery to generate PDF for documentation.  (I'm planning to put in
the PDF generatin anyway).

This morning I'll merge some changes from silver and work on the build
without X11 item.

exact memory fails me but i believe the libdt.text might contain
the command completion list of clef. the fact that it is not currently
used might be that i never got around to connecting it. 

gloss.text is supposed to be an automated glossary for the original
axiom book. i don't believe i ever picked that up when i recreated
the book.

there is another bit of functionality to recover. axiom had a 
'javadoc' functionality which creates per-domain/cat/pkg documentation
in single page format. i have a printed pile containing such info.
unfortunately the command to create it only ran on the mainframe
so i can find no surviving record of the code.

ulitmately these files had some purpose in the system which might
still remain to be recovered. removing them won't hurt anything but
it might be interesting to investigate why they exist.

the pdf differs from the sources. the pdf is an exact copy of the
published book as printed with the ISBN. there have been patches
applied to the sources which people have submitted so the sources
differ marginally, thus it is not possible to recreate the pdf
unless you go into the archive and fetch the unpatched sources.

In that case, we could 

  (1) rename the current bookvol1.pdf to original-bookvol1.pdf
      so that its name suggests its purporse
  (2) generate PDF for the patched version -- we might add that it
      is not officially publsihed yet and contains correction to
      previous edition.

What do you think?

libdt.text contains information about constructors.  We create 
up-to date version, but gold/silver do not install it.  See:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-10/msg00549.html

for a patch.

AFAICS gloss.text contains identical information as the glossary
section of axiom book -- so one can be generated for the other
(I would prefer to generate 'gloss.text' from the book).  
I wrote that 'gloss.text' was generated -- I was wrong, 'gloss.text'
was just copied around. 'gloss.text' is unused, but
there is code which could generate 'glosskey.text', 'gloss.ht'
and 'glossdef.text' from it.  ATM I withdraw proposal to remove
'gloss.text' (will investigate this further).

If you install fresly build 'libdb.txt', then this functionality
works.

with the exception of 'gloss.text' the files in first and second
group are generated during build and have known purpose.

I think that having two versions of bookvol1 is confusing for users.
Since later edits should improve the book (or update it to match
the program), I would opt for distributing with sources only the
latest version.
For people who want exact copy of published book we could provide
instructions how to fetch the pamphlet from the SCM (say add 
README.original-bookvol1).  Additionaly we can provide .pdf on
Axiom web site. 

One extra remark:  It make sense to put generated documentation
into distribution tarball, but IMHO generated files (with the exception
of files needed to bootstrap) should be removed from source archive.
And even for bootstrap files I think that we should remove them
from main source directory and put them in separate area (say
in subdirectories of 'bootstrap' directory, paralel to 'src').

Alfredo and Tim,

Please update the Axiom wiki page to improve it as you suggest.

Thanks.

The only information required is name and email address - it can be
a psuedo-name if you prefer. Is that silly?

It would be very helpful to me (and other people trying to use the
wiki) if you would report any problems you have so that they can be
addressed. "did not work" is not very helpful :-(

I have been working my way through the book.  The first version of

The second version (section 10.3,  page 489) produces some error

Hello,

I used axiom last year and I was afflicted because I couldn't use axiom
for the little computations I make with/for my students.

This list gave me pretty advices, but my attempts for improving
trigonometric functions in manip.spad failled.  
Changing this file is to difficult for me.

However Axiom is the better free computer algebra system, 
so I use it again this year even if I can't do what I want !

Now I'll try to make my own little package for pretty expand, combine and 
rewrite functions only over Expression Integer and Expression Complex Integer.

In fact I try today to get a nice result for this exercice I'll give to my
students : 

   sum ((cos x)^k * cos (k*x), k=0..n) 

Is it possible to load at the boot-time the packages or the 
functions that we prefer ?

So I won't need to type expand$MyExpand (cos (3*x/2)) but only expand
(cos (3*x/2)) in the interpreter, even if my expand function in
MyExpand.spad package will use sometimes the expand function of the
manip.spad file.

For this example axiom prefers real (sum ((cos x)^k * exp(%i*k*x), k=0..n))
to sum ((cos x)^k * cos (k*x), k=0..n). 

Where can be the nice rewrite command trigo. to exp. added ? in sum.spad ?

Long life to axiom.

Francois, in France.

	Hi,

	This is a resume of the methods given here by Humberto Ortiz-Zuazaga  
as I used them to get a working gcl and AXIOMsys (for people like me  
in a hurry to get gcl and axiom working on OSX 10.4.8 PPC) both  
installed in /usr/local and using bash.

	Building gcl :

	remove  -lintl from the LIBS line of ./h/powerpc-macosx.defs
	isolate Fink (/sw/... by default) and DarwinPorts (/opt/local/...)  
from gcl's path :

	PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin
	./configure --enable-locbfd --disable-statsysbfd --disable-nls

	(I added two symbolic links in /usr/local/bin : the first since  
pdflatex was needed for completion of the make and the second  
(optional) for .dvi generation of the make install (the location of  
your pdflatex and tex may vary...) :
	  cd /usr/local/bin		
  	  sudo ln -s /sw/bin/pdflatex pdflatex
	  sudo ln -s /sw/bin/tex tex
	)

	make     (*)
	sudo make install
	

	Building axiom (very long...) :

	I used exactly Humberto's method here (I got darcs 1.0.7 here :  
http://el-tramo.be/software/darcs-ppc-static/ since Fink's darcs  
wouldn't install) :

	darcs get http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom-darcs/

	chmod +x configure
  	./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-gcl
	(verify that the right gcl is chosen!)
  	chmod +x config/mkinstalldirs
  	make

	If you get the SIGCLD errors then, in the files sselect.c.pamphlet  
and viewman.c.pamphlet, replace :
	#if defined(BSDplatform)
	by
	#if defined(BSDplatform) || defined(MACOSXplatform)

	Should you get errors in hyper apply the patch to src/hyper/ 
hthits.pamphlet as proposed by Waldek Hebisch a day earlier in the  
'viewman and hyper on Mac OS X' thread. (here some .pamphlet files  
were missing in my hyper directory and I had to restore them first...)

	make
	sudo make install
	
	In your .profile file (for bash) add the path :
	/usr/local/axiom/target/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0/bin

	And you should have a working AXIOMsys...

	axiom itself fails with the lines :

	ptyopen: Failed to open /dev/ptmx: No such file or directory
	start_the_Axiom: ptyopen failed: No such file or directory
	
	Humberto got an additional error :
	(HyperDoc) Cannot connect to the X11 server!

	Of course all this it is far from the ideal
	./configure
	make
	he suggested but it worked for me so if you need to build it from  
source now...
	

	With my sincere thanks to Humberto and all of you,
				Raymond


(*) you may get an error in gcl_readline.d:221 (readline completion)  
I (hope temporarily...) just returned NULL;

Just for the record, if you do a

darcs get --set-scripts-executable http://page.axiom-developer.org/repository/axiom-darcs/

then it won't be necessary to chmod +x configure.

I just neticed that a large documentation hunk was copied almost
verbatim from 'src/interp/daase.lisp.pamphlet' into 'src/etc/asq.c.pamphlet'
IMHO this is _very_ bad practise. It increas work needed to maintain
Axiom.  And the to copies are likely to get out of sync anyway, which
will cause confusion to the readers.

AFAICS the copy in 'src/etc/asq.c.pamphlet' should be removed and
replaced by text like:

Database structure is described in [[src/interp/daase.lisp.pamphlet]].
Note that [[asq]] currently works only with compressed databases.

Many systems (Linux, BSD and supposedly also Mac OS X) provide 'openpty'
function as a preferred method to open a pty (for example on Linux
'openpty' will use Unix 98 ptys, but if those are not available it
will fall back to legacy ptys).  'openpty' seem to be available
in 'libutil', so in order to use it we must link to 'libutil'.

The patch below tries to 'openpty': add configure check and auguments
compiler and linker argument.  There are some things which probably
should be done in different way (please comment):

1) configure defines 'HAVE_OPENPTY' preprocessor symbol, this symbol
   is then propagated via 'DEFS' make variable and compile command
   line.  Alternatively we could have a common header file generated
   by configure

2) I only modified clef and sman Makefiles, but it is probably better
   to use the same set of libraries and the same compiler command line
   for all compilations.

Although the text in some blocks is the same the structure of the
documents are different. Asq does not contain all of the information
that is in daase. Both documents needs explanation and they
will diverge in the future. I'm looking at changing asq to handle
html style output. The information will certainly diverge (and you'll
notice that they are structured differently) as I continue to change asq.
The asq changes are not fully documented. Please have patience.

You have to indent this line (it will be be considered as a continuation
of the previous line) or use an underscore (line continuation
character), so:

    makeObject(f, xrange, yVar=3Dy0..y0+width,
       var2Steps =3D=3D 1, colorFunction =3D=3D (x,y) +-> color,
          space =3D=3D sp)
or

    makeObject(f, xrange, yVar=3Dy0..y0+width,
       var2Steps =3D=3D 1, colorFunction =3D=3D (x,y) +-> color,_
       space =3D=3D sp)

With an underscore the indentation does not matter. I don't know if your
code used to work in the past.

In fact there is an error in the book, the underscore does not need to
be escaped.

Hello,

could someone tell me what ")compile blah.as" is actually doing in Axiom?

It is certainly more than saying

aldor -O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y 
$AXIOM/algebra blah.as

(without having an Axiom session running).

I think someone once said that )compile calls aldor with the above flags 
and then also generates object files from the .lsp files. How could I 
achieve that from outside Axiom? Or is it enough to provide the .lsp 
files and the compilation to object files is triggered when the code is 
first used?

Further, I actually have a whole library (several .as files). What would 
be the right procedure to compile them externally (I want to do that via 
  Makefiles) and then provide some nice mechanism to load the compiled 
library into Axiom.

I just need a rough overview.

Thank you
Ralf

Yes.

Do you mean generate stand alone object files from .lsp files? This
would be done with a Lisp compiler, of course. In principle you can
use GCL just like Axiom does, but you must also provide a Lisp
run-time. The Aldor distribution has such a lisp run-time that is
supposed to be equivalent to the Aldor C run-time environment, but
my initial attempts to use it with GCL ran into trouble - maybe
some GCL incompatibility with the lisp run-time source?

If you want to generate object files that can later be loaded into
Axiom, I am not sure that it is possible to do this outside of Axiom
because I suspect there symbols that are known only to Axiom. If you
discover a way, I would be quite interested. Remember that because
it is written in Lisp AXIOM really just GCL + a lot of extra Lisp code.
So internally in AXIOM, compiling Lisp to object code is done by the
same underlying GCL mechanisms.

No. You must compile the .lsp files inside Axiom.

Ralf, do you know section 18.12 : Using Aldor outside AXIOM for AXIOM
of the Aldor User's Guide?

http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap18.html#12

"When you are ready to test and use your code within AXIOM, start
up AXIOM and then )cd to the directory containing your compiled code.
Invoke )compile on each .lsp file you wish to use."

See also section 18.11.

Why compile "externally"? Why not just use Axiom in your Makefile,
the way it is currently done in the Axiom build. E.g.

myfile.NRLIB/code.o: myfile.as
	echo ')compile myfile.as' | AXIOMsys

You can use the ')dir' option of the ')library' command to load
all the object files in a given subdirectory

)library )dir mylib

See section 16.4 of the Axiom book:

I strongly agree with Waldek. You should not be duplicating information
from src/interp/daase.lisp.pamphlet in the documentation for asq. This
is independent of whether asq produces HTML styly output or not. In
reference to the underlying database structure I think you should use
Waldek's version.

Although it's small, so this kind of thing doesn't get lost in the
email trash, as a matter of discipline can one of you submit a patch,
create an issue report

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/IssueTracker

or make the correction to the online version of the book?

Well, that fix does allow the file to load. I have hardbound version
of the book and the underscore is there but is very small and
runs against the line number so I thought it was just a piece of dirt.
I am surprised that the second indenting is required as the line
aboce is at the same nesting level, i.e. parameters to makeObject.

When I try to execute with
drawRibbons([x**i for i in 1..5], x=3D-1..1, y=3D0..1)
axiom quietly exits, that is, no error message.

There is also a surperfluous \ in the line num :=3D \# flist

I guess I didn't. The following is the last thing I got

Proxy Error

The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
The proxy server could not handle the request=20
POST /axiom--test--1/src/doc/Book.

Reason: Error reading from remote server

Additionally, a 502 Bad Gateway error was encountered while trying to use a=
n=20
ErrorDocument to handle the request.

Richard,

The proper procedure for making changes to the sources is:

1) find the bug in the file foo.pamphlet
2) fix the bug and save it in foo.pamphlet.new
3) diff -Naur foo.pamphlet foo.pamphlet.new >foo.pamphlet.patch
4) send foo.pamphlet.patch to the list

In this case I've already fixed the typos. 
Thanks for the report.

I started working on the modifications to the
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomBinaries page.

The initial try is in: http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxDoyen

I added the table, but reversed the columns and the rows. Much work
is needed on the page, and suggestions are welcome.

AxiomBinaries contains a lot of useful information, but it is just too much
for one page.

I also want to add info from http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SilverBinaries

Regards,

Alfredo

Actually your change to

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/doc/Book

did work.

The following error was caused by me while correcting a different
problem on the server:

Sorry. It should be ok now. Please let me know if it happens again.

Thanks for the edit.

I agree. In general there should not be any pdf files in the source

Eh? Methinks you've missed the whole point of aim of the axiom project.

Documentation in any form is to be desired and it often cannot be
created "from the source". PDFs can contain things, like fonts, which
the target machine may not have available. Video documentation will
certainly not be able to be created from the source as the rendering
of the video may require special equipment and tools.

The user might not have tools, like dvitopdf, or have different tools,
like dvi2pdf giving different results. Or the user might be on windows
without these tools at all. And if a 10 minute tutorial takes weeks to
create and hours to render with special tools (e.g. Camtasia) why
would we want the user to do that?  Why rerender .ps files that
exist? There are already complaints posted that axiom takes too long
to build.


I must say I'm completely confused by the current directions.
Who invented the idea that we need to recreate everything from source?
And who invented the idea that we don't keep exact copies of published
documentation (with ISBN numbers) in the archive?

Again, methinks you've missed the whole point of the axiom project.

There is NO distinction between documentation and "source code". That is
oldthink. In this brave new world there are only literate programs.
Creating human readable output from human oriented input is THE soul
of the project. We need to completely entwine the research with the old
idea of source code and conflate the idea of compiling with the idea of
latexing the code. This is THE PRIMARY DESIGN GOAL of the axiom project.

Gaby and Waldek, you are both new to this project but it has now been
around for some 33+ years and free for the last 6 years. Under the guise
of "build improvements", which was originally started as an effort to
bring autoconf to axiom, I now see changes made and proposed that go
against the fundamental project goals. Please look around, read and
understand these goals. They've been written down and talked about
at length both in this group and online at various places.

Tim

If you say

> $AXIOM/algebra blah.as

then

axiom

then

)lib blah

it should work. I guess that in this case the lisp is interpreted rather than
compiled. But usually, that doesn't matter anyway, at least not for
development.

Unfortunately,

)lib )dir .

(as described in HyperDoc) doesn't work properly in this case, I have no idea
why. The signatures seem to get loaded, but calling a function makes axiom
stumble.

Sorry, but I felt I have to give my 2 cent on this. Tim, I think everybody on
the project understands the goals of Axiom :-), specially Bill.

I think what Bill and Waldek are saying is that pdf's, dvis, ps files
should be available to the user by another medium (www, etc...) and
not the SCM programs.

I do not think this contradicts in any way the concept of LP and the
Axiom goals.

Regards,

Alfredo

Tim, first I must question your monopoly on stating Axiom goals. 
In open source project all members choose goals.  If members
goals are fundamentally incompatible, then there is time to fork.
However, (as I belive is in Axiom case) if goals differ slightly,
it should be possible to work togehter (compromising on lesser
goals if needed).

Secondly, I read many times what you wrote about Axiom goals and
I find it still not clear -- there are nice dreams (which I share
with you) and implementation strategy (which I doubt will work).

I think here is crucial misconception: what I (and other people) propose
is separation of SCM and Axiom distribution.  Typical user will
fetch _distribution_.  Exact content of distribution may be discussed
separately, but the point is that distribution should be usable
"immediatly" (or maybe with minimal effort).  Axiom servers should
archive past distribitions -- from may point of view it is not
very important how (dated tarballs, blobs in datbase or version
contrion could do that).  SCM should contain just source.

If sombody thinks that we should distribute a Git pack containing
full Axiom archive (including history), I have nothing against
it (as long as int in not the only distribition format).

Tim, I am affraid that the newspeak does not allow you to say clearly
what you want.  For me compilation is basicaly freezing some aspects
of source and caching intermediate low-level data to gain execution
efficiency.  Now, human oriented input means that we really _do not
want_ latexing as extra step: Axiom content should be presented in
optimal way without any extra effort.  Similarly with compilation:
the user should see human oriented input and the final result, while
the intermediate data should be hidden.  

Whith this in mind, can you sincerely say that machine generated
Lisp is a "human oriented output"?  We may wish to show some
specimens of machine generated Lisp to illustrate how the compiler
works, but the bulk of it belongs to a special ghetto.

OK, I've commited the removal of -lintl from powerpc-macosx.defs from
both branches.  This and the --disable-nls which is now in
configure.in and passed to the binutils subconfigures should remove
the above.  I.e. ./configure --prefix=...  should work, if anyone has
a moment to verify.

Take care,

I certainly don't think so. I am only talking about the Axiom source
code repository, not the Axiom project as a whole. The source code
repository is the part of the Axiom project that contains the Axiom
source code. Period.

True. Documentation is not source code but source code i.e. pamphlet
files, can be used to create some of the Axiom documentation.

True.

We are talking about the source code repository. For someone to
use this repository they will have to have appropriate tools for
the types of products they expect to create from this source.

I don't want the user to do that. They should be able to just
click on a hyperlink and listen, watch or read.

The build should only produce those products that the user asks for
and the things required to make these products, recursively, from
the source. Of course these intermediate products can be cached
during the build but should not be retained in the repository. In
addition the source code repository should not contain anything
that is pre-generated by some means not available in the source.

Not me. I am only talking about the source code repository.

I did not say we don't keep exact copies of published documentation.
I just said it doesn't belong in the source code repository.

You are wrong.

Yes there is. You just said yourself above that there are things
that we want to call documentation that can not generated from an
source code.

I have no problem at all with "literate programs", but I agree with
your first statement about this (that there are important kinds of
documentation that can not be created from any source) rather than
you second statement. Not all things are literate programs.

Well I agree that it is an important aspect. I don't see any
conflict with the proposal to only keep source code in the source
code repository.

I agree with the philosophy of literate programming.

I strongly disagree with you. I think both Gaby and Waldek have
made an extraordinary contribution to ensuring that the Axiom
project does not sink into a self-made blackhole. As far as I can
the work they are doing is the only viable way forward.

I agree with all of the goals but I disagree on a number of
specific points about how you think we should achieve them.

It seems that ^D can only be read from the AXIOMsys terminal, which I
think should cause an exit of that AXIOMsys.  This will close the
socket, so that sman or spadclient should be able to have read return
0, which should then cause it to close that connection on its end
too.  When this should cause a general exit from sman is beyond me --
perhaps there is useful work that can be done with just the hypertex
up but no console.  Personally, I don't think it too egregious to
terminate everything when the 'master' axiom sys (i.e. the first one
opened') reads EOF.

Thank you so much Tim!  The intl patch is in now.

Are we also OK on windows?  And I guess the last, which may not be
that important anymore, is sparc solaris.

Take care,

Greetings, and thanks!  I guess I must have beat you to it.  Just a
quick note -- when we do commit a bug fix to the proto-stable branch,
kindly also make sure it is fixed in cvs head -- it is the converse
which of course does not apply.

Take care,

Greetings!

May I suggest trying this entry from amd64-linux.h:

#ifdef IN_SFASL
#include <sys/mman.h>
#define CLEAR_CACHE {\
   void *p,*pe; \
   p=(void *)((unsigned long)memory->cfd.cfd_start & ~(PAGESIZE-1)); \
   pe=(void *)((unsigned long)(memory->cfd.cfd_start+memory->cfd.cfd_size) & ~(PAGESIZE-1)) + PAGESIZE-1; \
   if (mprotect(p,pe-p,PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE|PROT_EXEC)) {\
     fprintf(stderr,"%p %p\n",p,pe);\
     perror("");\
     FEerror("Cannot mprotect", 0);\
   }\
}
#endif


I.e., copy powerpc-macosx.{defs,h} to i386-macosx.{defs,h}, make the
above modification, make sure configure detects the host right, and
then see where we are.

This code flushes the data cache so that the cpu ca properly execute
code that has just ben loaded into the data segment.  I typical
symptom of this not having been done is SIGILL as some random
instruction gets fed to the cpu.  Historically, i386 has not needed
this, but I have noticed a tendency towards requiring this
functionality as computers have been evolving over the past few
years.  mprotect is a generic syscall way to achieve the same end
without cpu specific assembly.  It might work across the board -- I
have not had time to check.

Please keep me posted.

Take care,

Hello Camm,

  Yes, you're of course right on both accounts.

After GCL-2.6.8 is out (I hope we are reaching the end of the pressing
issues this wee), could we make GCL head's configure wrok with
Autoconf 2.52 and higher?

I just tested with a new copy from CVS, and gcl compiles without problems=
=2E

I used:

$ ./configure --prefix=3D/usr/local --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd
--enable-vssize=3D65536*2 --enable-maxpage=3D256*1024 --disable-x
--disable-xgcl --disable-tkconfig

I'll try to build an axiom with that later today.

Gaby, how current is the tarball in build-improvements? Have you
included these patches?

Not those against GCL (I just woke up and started reading Axiom list - I
should probably be grading students homework :-).  I synced
build-improvements with silver yesterday.

While composing this message, I fired the upgrade to the most recent
GCL-2.6.8pre.  Do you see any other patches that I may have forgotten
that should go into build-improvements?

Of course.  In fact, if time and manpower allows, I'd like to rewrite
configure.in and move to Makefile.am sources.  But there is so much
more that is more pressing than this, that the status quo has
prevailed for some time.

Greetings!

If someone has a moment, could someone please explain to me the
relationship between the various axiom branches, and which one is
connected to an 'official release', and if same at such time will
accompany a tarball or not.

Take care,

Yes. :-(

I hope to have some students interested in GCL, research-wise.

I believe your version of Axiom has a bug which was recently fixed in
silver and build-improvents, see:

Quite right. That was an older version installed from Debian. On another
machine installed from CVS this June, there is no problem.

> Tim, first I must question your monopoly on stating Axiom goals. 

Really? Why? Axiom didn't drop magically from the sky.

I picked up a collection of source files that were being removed from
commercial distribution and thrown out. The collection was not
complete and not functional.

As one of the original authors of the code, prior to its becoming
a commercial product, I was quite upset to see that all of that 
fundamental research in computational math was going to be destroyed.

It took nearly 3 years of my work to put Axiom back together.

I spent a great deal of time in discussion with others and pondering
the past to decide what killed Axiom and what might keep it alive.
I attended a research conference in France and called old developers.
Further, I spent time discussing goals that would make it interesting
30 years from now. Out of these discussions came the project goals.
That's not a monopoly, that's cooperation. I'm open to discussing
goals but not in this "we're right, you're wrong" adversarial
approach. The goals define the project and the development, not the
other way around.

After Axiom started working I set up a new project on Savannah
and Sourceforge. Based on limitations of these services I purchased
my own domain and server (axiom-developer.org). I ran a conference
on Axiom. I recreated our prior book and constructed a second book.
I lectured on Axiom. I attended conferences and recovered old
connections with people I knew and constantly try to form new ones,
such as the sage connection and the numerical mathematics consortium
connection.

I work on Axiom probably 60 hours a week and have done so into
the distant past. I spent about $4000 in the last twelve months
in server support costs, freely distributed books, CDs mailed to
people, purchasing special purpose hardware such as a MAC, attending
conferences, and trips to visit universities to discuss ideas. I've
worked to get old research brought into free code and am still 
working to free vital work such as Manuel's before it gets lost.

I created the project from nothing and brought it to where it is 
today. The project is an open source effort to achieve certain
fundamental goals, one of which is literate programming. I rewrote
virtually every file in Axiom into a document form and rebuilt the
whole build machinery to use that form. There is still much work
to be done and many ideas to explore which tighten the relationship
between the literate tools, the pamphlet files, and the gestalt
which is the future of axiom. Doing things like removing the
prototype version of the document command or splitting off the
"documentation" from the "source"  make it clear that either
you don't understand this or you don't agree with the goal.

Working under the assumption that you don't understand it I've asked
that you step back, stop slicing off "dead" portions of the project,
and try to invent, extend, and enhance the prototypes so they can
achieve the long term goals. Instead of removing duplicate
documentation, as in the asq discussion, you should propose a long
term idea, like arranging pamphlet file machinery which can share
sections, and construct new literate tools to make it work.

If, however, you don't agree with the goals then you're clearly
not working on Axiom but working on your own project under the
guise of working on Axiom. That's a fork. If this is the case
then I ask two things:
  1) Please set up your own savannah project under a different name.
     You're welcome to take any code, as per the license agreement.
  2) As a professional courtesy please stop using the Axiom name.
     I've invested a lifetime of work in defining what it means.

Axiom is a project with stated goals. Those goals are supposed
to set the direction of the project. Axiom's been quite flexible
about methods of reaching those goals. For instance, Bill has 
insisted that the browser be the basis for future user interface
work. He's been very convincing and at this point I agree with him.
The Crystal effort and the new hyperdoc browser are trying to use 
the firefox browser as a base.

However I see the build-improvements branch completely ignoring goals.
When *I* don't understand why decisions are being made and how they
fit the future direction I have to say something fundamental is broken.

I'm watching the build-improvements branch fit Axiom to the tools
rather than the other way around. Axiom's being laid upon a 
procrustean bed, with parts being cut off because they don't "fit"
the tools. 

* I see files being rewritten because noweb can't handle them.
* I see patches to tools being rejected as inappropriate, treating
  the tool as more important that the project.
* I see files being rejected and modified because SVN has a problem.
* I see files being thrown out, like the document command, because
  they don't fit some standard.
* I see the designed structure of Axiom, rather than being implemented
  using autoconf, being restructured to fit the dictates of autoconf and
  the free software foundation.
* I see the idea of literate programming being pulled apart into
  "source" and "documentation" to fit ideas foreign to the project
  in the name of "today's standards".

Axiom is not about the tools. Axiom is about creating new ideas.
Axiom had a browser before browsers existed. Axiom created clef
with features that enhanced Axioms useability. Axiom created
object-oriented programming before the idea existed and still
does things that some other OO systems don't such as distinguishing
on return types. These ideas were ahead of their time.

Axiom needs to be ahead of its time so that it is alive and
interesting in 30 years. We can't do that by following the crowd.
Each issue should raise a question about the best way to do it
regardless of whether current tools support the idea or current
standards support the idea. Instead I see the tool defining the
chosen solution.

This isn't about compromise and this isn't about standards. This is
about inventing the future. I hear people complaining about keeping
a snapshot of GCL and how "wrong" this is to subsume other projects
(even though GCL has several projects subsumed in it). I can't
imagine the outcry when Axiom swallows ACL2 in order to support
a program proof technology, one of the stated goals.

If you don't understand the goals of the project or they are unclear
perhaps the proper course of action is to discuss what you plan to
implement to see if it conforms to the goals rather than implement
something and claim the project goals need to compromise.

Yes, Axiom has dreams. Dreams of the 30 year horizon. Almost nothing
we see today as "standard" will be interesting or useful in 30 years.
I believed "top-down structured programming" and "decision table"
programs were the only way to program. I now know enough to know
that autoconf standards are a passing fad. They fix problems that
don't need to exist in the first place. Strong literate programming,
however, attacks a fundamental problem, namely that the research is 
now separated from the implementation. That is a fundamental flaw in
computational mathematics. We must dream and invent new ways, both
social and technical, which overcome this fundamental rift. That's
why I am trying so strongly to make my case. Axiom has a fundamental
project goal to eliminate the distinction between "documentation"
and "source". I'm trying to implement "drag-and-drop" research
papers. I'm working with Carlo Traverso, head of the math department
in Pisa to create a peer-reviewed "live", literate journal. I'm on
a program committee of a conference related to the topic.

I'm trying to craft a multi-fuel transportation system for the next 30
years and you're busy optimizing the gas engine for speed by removing
the experimental modifications.

I see that you're doing excellent work and that you're making great
strides in adapting Axiom to today's technology. And you've clearly
energized people by showing such rapid progress in optimizations and
adoption of standards. Your car will be blindingly fast.

But you've missed the goal.

did actually follow?  Do you believe it is just a matter of them not

Over the last couple of months I've been talking to colleagues in
France about gathering effort around Axiom.  I can't reproduce the
reactions here.  I don't believe this is just a matter of people not
knowing the value of a project.  There is something deeper to be
analyzed.  No, it is not just because they don't understand

Tim, please check *facts* before you make a fool of yourself in public

Hi Camm,

  As you see the project is a bit unfocused at the moment.

However, there are basically three branches:

  * silver -- this is a dayly mirror of the source bas ethat Tim uses.
    It is effectively read-only, even if theoretically you could
    commit there.  How it should evolve is unclear, and a lot of
    debate is going on.

  * build-improvements -- this is a branch that I maintain.  Its goal
    is to bring Axiom to a state where the build machinery is
    simplified for both developers and end-users: Ideallym they should
    just say

       ./configure && make && make install

    I'm using Autoconf (no Automake at the moment).  You can commit to
    that branch if you have write access to the SourceForge repository.
    When completed, it will be proposed for merge to the main source.

    People have been able to build and run Axiom from
    build-improvements on systems that traditional releases of Axiom
    where unable to support.

    I did not originally anticipate making tarballs out of that
    branch, but repeated experience with students and some users
    around here had shown that I need to make a tarball.  I've done
    that but, not officially.  Depending on how all this issue
    developed, how much of interest it generates, and how long it
    takes to complete the branch, I may have to make regular tarballs
    out of that branch.  But, it is not something I planned on.  It is
    up to the community.

  * the third branch is by Antoine.  It "looks" less active at the
    moment. I'm not really qualified to comment.

| True. Documentation is not source code but source code i.e. pamphlet

Indeed.  Let me expand on this.
We are talking of pamphlet files.  So, the way I read Waldek's use
of "documentation" is "the produced PDF format (or any other
processed) file that explains the system".  I did not realize it could
be parsed as meaning that the pamphlet should be thrown away.  I could
be wrong and I cannot speak for Waldek, but I certainly did not read
it as meaning that the pamphlet should be thrown away.  If axiom is
suffering from something, it is certainly is from lack or documentation.

It it my belief that the Axiom source code repository should ideally
contain all of the system explanation that is needed to reproduce,
say, a PDF format of all that is needed to know, to understand, to
use, and to extend the system.  If the source code repository in not
in a state where that is achievable, then the source code repository
is incomplete, and must be completed.  Consequently, if the corrected 
bookvol1 cannot be reproduced with current sources, then someone is hiding
something.  If the source code is complete, then there is no need to
maintain the PDF format in the source core repository.  That does not
necesarily mean information is thrown away.

Greetings, and thanks so much!

What about 'golden'?  Would it be appropriate to make 'official' axiom
release tarballs from this branch when updated from silver?  Or is the
notion of 'release' slower than the progress of 'golden'?

Take care,

Ok. Clearly I'm not getting my point across.
And we're not communicating.
So I'm going to try something else.

As of this moment Axiom is a complete democracy.

Gaby, I believe you have write access to both Gold and Silver.
You also have complete access on sourceforge. If you want
contact myself or Bill Page and we'll set you up as admin
on savannah.

Anyone else who desires read/write access can contact myself or 
Bill Page who has admin access everywhere. Anyone who wants
admin access on savannah or sourceforge please contact myself
or Bill Page.

I will no longer be the "point of failure" in the project.
You are all now responsible for either checking in your own
changes or electing someone to do it for you.

Releases will be done in any way you can all agree upon.

Choose your own goals, create your own future.

I'm stepping away from the lead developer role and will now
act as just another developer.

Tim Daly

Hello Bill,

Thanks a lot for your answer.

No no. I just want to compile files for later use within Axiom, but I 
don't want to start an interactive axiom session, obviously.

Good point. I should really even more often read the AUG. But I usually 
read the .pdf version and there the part about AXIOM is missing. I hope 
the html doc does not get removed suddenly. Hopefully it is mirrored 
somewhere.

Very good suggestion. It seems that I will take that approach. I have to 
test whether I still like it if some error occurs, though.

Hmmm, maybe I rather generate first a .al library and the .lsp files and 
only then use your approach to compile the .lsp files via AXIOMsys as 
you suggested.

Yes, definitely. Thanks a lot.

Ralf asked me to explain how, ideally, I envision the development
model, I've tried to explain it here:

  http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00179.html

That is not current situation; my hope is that if Tim agrees on that,
then it looks to me as if we would  make 'official' axiom release
tarballs from the "gold  branch (which is not anywhere under SVN at

I still can't pull the svn source on the Mac, so I pulled on a linux box
and copied them over to the Mac this morning.

I have built axiom again. I needed to patch 2 files:

1) src/hyper/hthits.pamphlet, using Waldek's patch:

and

I built --without-noweb --with-gcl, the configure for the built in gcl
isn't working right. I think it's a bug in gcl-2.6.8pre (if you call
configure with no --prefix, the make tries to echo data into /bin/gcl
and fails with permission problems).

I'll try to send Camm a patch (or at least a real bug report).

I think you should try harder to communicate. Communication
involves both listening and speaking. You especially need to
read email messages more carefully. Actually it seems to me
that you got your point across a long time ago and that people
are in fact acting on the goals that you set, even if they are
not doing it in exactly the way you envisaged.

I don't think organizing a project as a democracy is good idea
nor is it possible to create a democracy by fiat. People naturally
follow those people who lead, not necessarily those who are the
most vocal. As you have so often said when suggestions are being
made: "advocacy is volunteering" in other words "show me the code".
I strongly suspect that is how the Axiom project will continue to
evolve.

It seems to me that most open source project work by consensus
and compromise. When this fails, they either fork or die. I still
believe that consensus is possible here - after all we are not
such a big group of developers!

I prefer the option of checking in our own changes following some
discussion on the axiom-devel email list.

I think we should adopt the standard open source policy of release
early and release often. This is not a commercial software project
with milestones and cut-off dates. It is an ongoing, evolving
collaboration between interesting parties to achieve a set of
common goals.

We all do this every day.

I regret your decision, but I respect it. :-) I don't think that
it really should need to be said, but since I am in the mood and
it surely can't hurt let me just say: Thank you for all your
previous hard work and for your continued commitment to Axiom.
I have no doubt that it will continue to be a benefit to many
people over the next 30 years...

Regards,
Bill Page.

Tim,

I worry that some of your statements below might be interpreted badly
by some other people important to Axiom.

On November 6, 2006 1:53 PM you wrote:

I am not sure how you define "complete" but NAG did claim that
they had delivered to you a completely functional Axiom system
which ran on Linux. True, it was based on a different lisp system
(ccl) then the one you were most familiar with and some parts
that involved other commercial licenses had been removed, but
the decision to re-implement Axiom under gcl was yours. This
involved some significant extra work since both Axiom and gcl had
evolved some since this combination was last fully operational.

I don't think you were the only one. I recall several emails from
Mike Dewar of NAG to various email lists asking for people willing
to take on Axiom as an open source project. It's just a good thing
that you came along when you did. :-) Or do you think my summary
of this part of Axiom's history is not accurate? (It could be,
I wasn't there.)

Getting Axiom working under GCL also involved some very critical
input from both Camm Maguire and Jergen Weiss. In fact the email
archive shows that Jergen Weiss was the first one to report an
operational system and he contributed the updated Axiom database
that was essential to solve the remaining problems. (I remember,
I was there by then. :).

Anyway, this is not intended to reduce the importance of your
contribution by rather just to ensure that other people who
contributed in the "early days" are also properly recognized.

You mean "you" are trying to be flexible. To that I can only say,
well, um ...

Ok that's a point, but I felt at the time that it was a pretty
"hard sell". :-)

I agree, but I don't think it is with the approach being taken by
the build-improvements branch.

That is not true.

I see files being written in a standard literate programming language.

I see cooperation with other open source projects and relying on those
resources instead of alienating them.

I did see that at all. The only files being modified were because of
limitations in the target operating systems such as MAC OSX and
Windows.

>   they don't fit some standard.

That is not true.

> * I see the designed structure of Axiom, rather than being implemented
    using autoconf, being restructured to fit the dictates of autoconf
    and the free software foundation.

If by "designed structure" you mean the old make scripts, then I think
that is good thing. There are good ways to use the available tools and
there are bad ways. As I have said previously, in my opinion your
original make scripts were "just crazy".

I don't see any of that happening.

That is out of scope of the Axiom project. The future will invent
itself.

It is wrong to subsume other projects. That policy kills possible
collaboration and taxes limited resources. Concerning GCL: Camm has
said that he would like to correct this situation when possible.

There is no way that Axiom is going to "swallow" ACL2. Get
serious!

If we don't "energize people by showing rapid progress" and
thereby attract new developers and new contributions, there is
no way to achieve any of the goals that you have set for Axiom.

AFAICS you want to make your function visible and hide the system one
-- you can do this using )set expose system command.
At startup Axiom reads you initialization file, so probably you can
do this from initialization file (but I did not try).

BTW. Did you look at rischNormalize function in
ElementaryFunctionStructurePackage?  In principle rischNormalize
should be able to do all possible trigonometric (and logarithmic)
simplifications.

Here is a case where the system did not issue a diagnostic, but just
terminates with exit status 0 (!) [so it is not a case of message with
evidence of actual memory damage.  It is a case of non-message with
actuall memory damage.].  Type in

     VALUES(Integer)$Lisp

Even when we think the operation is meaningless, the system should try
hard not to crash.  In fact, the system can predict that the operation
is nonsensical and issue appropriate message.

Axiom Developers,

Although the attached email is from another list and is specifically
about Sage and Python, I decided to forward it here to the Axiom
Developer list because I think it is an excellent example of the
*right way* for open source projects to collaborate and co-operate.
I hope that we can achive this in the Axiom project.

Greg Ewing is the developer of an open source tool that compiles a
subset of Python to C++ for reasons of efficiency. Pyex for Sage
plays a similar role as Aldor for Axiom.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Subject: [sage-devel] Pyrex and SAGE

Hi Greg,

Pyrex is *awesome*.  It's existence is one of the main reasons that
I choose Python as the main interpreter language for SAGE
(http://modular.math.washington.edu/sage/).

I have lofty goals for SAGE, and Pyrex plays a key roll
in them.  E.g., we have used Pyrex a *huge* amount already
in SAGE:

sha:~/d/sage/sage was$ cat */*.pyx */*/*.pyx */*.pxd */*/*.pxd |wc -l
    51162

Also, I've written code to inline Pyrex in Python scripts (like
scipy's weave, but for Pyrex), and make it easy to use Pyrex 
from an interactive GUI (put %pyrex at the beginning of a block
in the SAGE notebook).

However, there are numerous specific goals for SAGE that absolutely
require me to modify Pyrex.  For example, it's crucial for SAGE
that it be easy to view the source code of functions from the
interactive prompt, like IPython does with Python code (via
Python's inspect module).  I very recently added support to the
SAGE version of Pyrex so it can embed file and line number
information in docstrings, so now source code of Pyrex functions
is easily viewable from Ipython (this isn't released yet).  Also,
Martin Albrecht and I made numerous changes to properly support
cimporting of modules defined in other directories (this works
very nicely now).

All these changes (and others) were easier than I thought they
would be, because you did an excellent job writing Pyrex in the
first place.   A potential problem is that the SAGE project is
creating a variant of Pyrex that is significantly different from
yours.  In particular, our version could (in theory -- hopefully
not in practice!) contain new bugs, misfeatures, and other things
you would not be proud to be attributed to you.   So what would
*you* prefer I do?:

    (1) Continue to distribute the SAGE-modified Pyrex as "pyrex",
        and make it very clear that the SAGE version has numerous
        modifications from your version, and that questions should
        be directed to the sage-forum instead of the pyrex forum.

    (2) Distribute the SAGE-modified version, but give it a different
        name, e.g., "SageX", so nobody will confuse it with Pyrex.
        If we do this, it will be made *extremely* clear in README's,
        documentation, etc., that "SageX" is a based very heavily on
        Pyrex by you. Hopefully this could be viewed not as a fork,
        but as an adaptation of Pyrex for use in the SAGE project.

    (3) Make a concerted effort to convince you to include in the
        next official release of Pyrex many of the modifications
        that we've made for SAGE.

In all cases, SAGE is a very strongly open source project, and all
of the SAGE modifications to Pyrex will always be made freely
available. So whatever you prefer it won't stop people interested
in using Pyrex from potentially benefiting from any SAGE work on
Pyrex.

After re-checking I have found out that both 'src/algebra/libdb.text'
and 'src/hyper/pages/ht.db' are not referenced from build improvements
Makefiles.  ATM I withdraw proposal to remove 'src/share/algebra/gloss.text',
pending extra investigation.

Actually, ATM both copies of 'util.ht' are in sync.  The following
patch removes reomves all references to 'src/share/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht'
from the makefiles, allowing removal of 'src/share/doc/hypertex':

I tried again 'make dvi' in build-improvements. There are still three
problems:
1) typo in 'src/etc/Makefile.pamphlet'
2) confusion because Latex prefers 'axiom.sty.tex' in current directory
   to 'axiom.sty' in search path
3) axiom.bib.tex file contains 10 file names with unescaped underscores
   inside.

I have a patch solving problems 1 and 2 (included below). BTW the patch
to solve 1 is trival.  I think that we shall agree that trivial patches
may be commited without review (but still posted to the mailing list).
Of course we need also agree what trivial means -- the solution to 2
(since it involves file renaming) is probably slightly beyond trival...

BTW.  I am a bit annoyed because of discrimination of underscores (I like
them very much), so I am tempted to solve 3 by making underscore into
an active character, which expands to ordinary underscore outside math
mode and to subscript char in math mode.


Beside applying the diff one has to also rename 'src/doc/axiom.sty.pamphlet'
to 'src/doc/axiom-sty.pamphlet'

I oppose against special treatment of .sty files.

The general rule should be

notangle file.ext.pamphlet > file.ext
noweave  file.ext.pamphlet > file.ext.pamphlet.tex

remove ".pamphlet" and add ".tex". That rule seems to be a bit simpler 
than having to explain why .sty files must be treated separately.

The string 'ATX=B' does not appear in interpreter sources, so I think
it is reasonable to assume that 'ATX=B.bitmap' is unused.

AFAICS segbind.ps is just a parabola (graph of square function). 
I think it is safe to delete both 'SEGBIND.ps' and 'segbind.ps'
-- both look like trash left by developers.

I propose: rename capital Greek letters according to
Bill Page proposal.  Adjust 'util.ht' to match (all other
hypertex pages should access Greek letters only via macros
defined in 'util.ht').  
Next, remove 'ATX=B.bitmap', 'SEGBIND.ps' and 'segbind.ps'.

Those changes should solve problems with duplicate filenames on
case insensitive filesystems.

Hi Waldek,

  I'm busy at the moment; but patch for (1) is obviously OK.

  Patch for (2) needs an explanation in the pamphlet as to why 
we are renaming.  You explained why in previous mails, but we need the
explanation in the pamphlet, not just in the mail [yes, it shows up
only for in-source build, because LaTeX looks in the current directory
first, but we need those in the pamphlet.  This is an exception to a
general naming scheme so it needs documentation. ]

  For problem (3), I'm awaiting for input from others.

  As for your other tentative patch for checking for openpty, I
believe you're reading in my mind.  I'll comment later. Then, I'll
have to add comments to the fixes to regex issue.  However simple, it
looks, we have to explain in the pamphlets (to people not versed in
system programming), especially the faith of regexp.h and why we must
use <regex.h> and remove the old macro interface.

Ralf,

   remove ".pamphlet" and add ".tex".

translates to
   
   noweave  file.ext.pamphlet > file.ext.tex

not
 
   noweave  file.ext.pamphlet > file.ext.pamphlet.tex

I believe that is what we currently do:

    if test x$do_weave = xyes; then
        file=`basename $1 .pamphlet`
        $weave -delay $1 > $file.tex

Right.

And I _suggested_ to change the current rule. That would avoid the 
problem with .sty files without renaming them.

Whether we have file.ext.tex or file.ext.pamphlet.tex does not matter 
from the point of view of filenames, since there are (at least) two dots 
already. And both are generated anyway.

But my naming scheme makes it simpler to allow srcltx.sty to work. That 
would allow 'inverse search' (i.e. click in the .dvi file and jump 
directly to the corresponding line in the corresponding file in the 
editor of your choice.

We don't have that yet in Axiom that one .dvi file consists of several 
pamphlets, but I am sure that will come.


Something like below would go to axiom.sty.pamphlet.
\SOURCEROOT is only there to allow relative or absolute path in the .dvi 
file.

Well, .sty files _are_ special (normal files do not contain "self
references").  And if you think about rule:

notangle file.ext.pamphlet > file.ext

this _is_ alredy broken by many files (in 'src/hyper') when we
have

file.pamphlet -> file.c

or

               /-> file.h
file.pamphlet -|
               \-> file.c

I agree that you proposal is logical, but it is also clumsy: .pamphlet
extension is already pretty long and sticking on it another extension
will give very long files names.

I thought your suggestion was

   remove ".pamphlet" and add ".tex". That rule seems to be a bit simpler
   than having to explain why .sty files must be treated separately.

Is that correct?

First. Why do you care about length of _generated_ filenames? You'll 
almost never see or touch them.

Second. With srcltx and inverse search, you _never_ have to type 
anything else than the command to start your dvi viewer with the right 
.dvi file. Everything else you read in the .dvi file, click there and 
magically your editor opens the right file at exactly the right place. I 
cannot imagine why you don't want that.

Third. I perhaps agree that just removing ".pamphlet" is not the best 
idea in general as you showed for pamphlets that contain .h and .c 
files. But note that then the corresponding Makefile must be more 
complex, since some logic of the .pamphlet file (namely that 
file.pamphlet contains file.h and file.c) is maintained externally to 
the .pamphlet.

Still, I would rather like to see a general scheme than just adjusting 
locally. Keep the rules simple (or rather: introduce simple rules).

One suggestion could be to have particular chunk names that say what are 
the "top-level" chunks and which are the corresponding filenames for 
notangle. (I explicitly say notangle, since I still want to see my 
suggestion of adding ".tex" to obtain ".pamphlet.tex" for noweave.)

I considered that some time ago.  

However, I must confess: file.h and file.c, to my mind, forms a
logical unit.  Consequently I think of file.pamphlet as that logical
unit be described.  I see no logical problem or exception that from
that logical unit, different sub-units are extracted to be processed by
the same tool (the C compiler). 
Consequently, I'm not convinced that it can be used an evidence for
the axiom.sty treatment.

I agree that the .pamphlet is clumsy, and we should not sacrifice
logic. 

I would like to understand more Ralf's suggestion, because I got
the impression that we already implemented what he is suggesting (but
apparently no).

I don't think what Waldek proposes amounts to "separate treatment".
He is just observing that the existing name for the pamphlet file
conflicts with the behaviour of latex.

I think Waldek is right. This name for the pamphlet file is
unusal. The only convention that we have is really just:

  noweave  filename.pamphlet > filename.tex
  latex filename.tex

and I think that is very natural because noweave always applies to
the entire file. Normally, the filename part does not contain any dot.

notangle is completely different because it can either apply to
the whole file or to just one chunk of the file (-R option). If
we have a convention for notangle, then I think it should be like
this:

  notangle filename.pamphlet -R 'file.ext' > file.ext

Is there a case like this? Maybe it should be written:

  notangle file.pamphlet -R 'file.c' > file.c

With <<file.c>>=3D defined appropriately.

In this case I think it is really

  notangle file.pamphlet -R 'file.h' > file.h
  notangle file.pamphlet -R 'file.c' > file.c
=20
Right?

I think the only convincing reason that Ralf gave for his
convention for noweave was interaction with point-and-click
in dvi. But this could be achieved through a different
patch to srcltx. No?

If I ever suggested that, I must have made a terrible mistake. I 
remember that we recently (about a week ago or so) had something on the 
list about .sty files. At that time your document had already been written.

No my suggestion is as I said in my last mail.
noweave file.pamphlet > file.pamphlet.tex.

Removing .pamphlet leads to the problem with
axiom.sty.pamphlet ---> axiom.sty.tex
axiom.sty.pamphlte ---> axiom.sty
both seen by TeX.

Rather change the document script.

I suspect I don't see why it *must* be that we must have ".pamphlet.tex".


There is a related issue, which is how serious Axiom is about
portability.  In some places, it seems quite stringent in its demand
(leading to quite awkward and unnatural acts, e.g. abbreviation
names), and yet it cavalierly overlooks them (e.g. not all filesystems
can handle filenames with more than on does in them).

yes, many of the C pamphlet files.  My eyes was caught by that, but

But I guess that patch would be a bit longer. In the patch I gave, I use 
the fact that \src@input (which is defined as \let\src@input\input) 
automatically adds the .tex extension.

I didn't want to change srcltx.sty too much and when I stumbled over 
that file.sty/file.sty.tex problem, I decided for file.sty.nw.tex (just 
adding the .tex extension) in ALLPROSE. In that way I made the patch 
short and I avoided another problem. And my rule is simple.

It is even a bit more complicated. My patch basically gets the clicks 
right, if the file contains \input of other files. It does not work with 
the master file. So if one translates file.pamphlet to file.tex even 
with my patch one doesn't get point&click. (Or rather the click will 
lead to the .tex file and not to the .pamphlet.) For that to work 
correctly, it would need yet another patch. I haven't investigated it 
since in ALLPROSE I automatically generate a wrapper that includes the 
generated latex files (plural!).

What speaks so much against just adding .tex?
Portability? Look at the output of

cd build-improvements
find . -name '*.*.pamphlet'

Is there a plan to rename them all?

Yes, I agree that the convention for notangle should interact
with chunk names. There is at least one system that uses noweb
format with the convention that all chunk names that "look like
file names" automatically imply extraction as a file name. E.g.

http://en.literateprograms.org/LiteratePrograms

Or we could adopt something like you suggest, i.e. a special
"top-level" chunk that contains that names of chunks to create
as files. But I think that would also have the negative effect
of hiding implicit file names inside the pamphlet file. In a
make script I think it is better to make it obvious how the
dependency is satisfied e.g.

file.c: filename.pamphlet
	document --tangle=3D'file.c' filename.pamphlet

would extract the chunk -R 'file.c' as a file named 'file.c'
from the file 'filename.pamphlet'. Or see Gaby's stanza
template rule and my proposed modification below.

It is possible to use srcltx even if we don't keep the
*.pamphlet.* part if we assume that all .dvi files are
derived from .pamphlet files. Right? I think this is a
reasonable assumption for Axiom given the policy on literate
programming.

I think with the current 'document' script that would have to
be:

     $(builddir)/%.c: $(srcdir)/%.pamphlet
             $(axiom_build_document) --tangle=3D$@ --output=3D$@ $<

because by default the --tangle option in 'document' will
extract the root chunk.

I would suggest allowing the --output option to default to the
chunk name instead of begin derived from the pamphlet name.  Then
one could wrote:

     $(builddir)/%.c: $(srcdir)/%.pamphlet
             $(axiom_build_document) --tangle=3D$@ $<


I.e. patch 'document' like this:

    if [ -z $output ]; then
-	output=3D`basename $file .pamphlet`;
+	output=3D$chunk;
    fi

Bill Page.

The drastic way... Remove axiom.bib.pamphlet (from which probably 
axiom.bib.tex was generated).
That is not really a .bib file. It is a collection of filenames. And I 
would rather see that the translated documentation has hyperlinks 
instead of references to a "bibliography" that consists of filenames.

If someone thinks that axiom.bib.pamphlet is a file in good LP style, I 
have not understood what LP means.

Underscores would be no problem at all if filenames where properly 
tagged. Note that there is a latex package called url
(/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc/url.sty)
which provides a \path command. Together with hyperref one can turn that 
also into hyperlinks.

(I don't like underscores. They cause problems in many places.)

srcltx does nothing else than writing setting a counter for the line 
number and writes calls

\special{src:\the\inputlineno\src@maybe@space\CurrentInput

or

\special{src:1\CurrentInput}

which puts some bytes into the .dvi for the point&click.

Hmmm... the task would than be to write a tex macro which
replaces the .tex extension of \CurrentInput by .pamphlet.

Maybe that would be a solution. But it doesn't solve the axiom.sty.tex 
problem.

Ugh! You are right. Despite Gaby's implication, I can not think
of any file system in use today where we might want to run Axiom
that does not permit multiple dots in file names.

But yes, I think Tim did promote a plan that would (eventually)
change most of these names. For example I think all the .input
test files would likely be collected as chunks within a single
testing "volume" .pamphlet.

However pamphlet files with multiple chunks interact badly with
the make dependency processing since changing or adding a single
chunk in a pamphlet file triggers re-extraction of all files
dependent on that pamphlet and subseqent dependent make processing.
To over come this, we would have modify the 'document' script so
that it does not touch an existing file if it has not changed
(i.e. extract the chunk to a temporary file and overwrite the
original only if diff -q fails).

In the mean time, I think just renaming axiom.sty as Waldek
suggested is not so confusing, given the discussion in the rest
of this thread. Maybe instead of 'axiom-sty.pamphlet' something
like 'axiom-latex.pamphlet' might be a better name with
<<axiom.sty>=3D and possibly other latex-related chunks collected
in a single pamphlet file.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Gaby, maybe the last sentence of mine was misleading.
I meant: remove .pamphlet for notangle and add .tex for noweave.

I agree that LP suggests to think in terms of logical units for humans, 
but on the other hand I am still a bit old-fashioned (and maybe also 
human), since I would have hard times to look in the file system for the 
place of a particular file (which is hidden in a .pamphlet file with 
another name). In that sense pamphlet files would not fit me as a human. 
Maybe I should change ... ;-)

I support Ralf's view. The axiom.bib.pamphlet file doesn't make
any sense to me.

I like this idea but I think it might need more thought. How do
we want to present this large collection of Axiom documentation
files to a user? How will they navigate? How will this interact,
or will it interact with hyperdoc? Will they be searchable? What
is better, dvi or pdf? Etc.

Bill Page.

>=20

:-) That is definitely not "new think". There are many places
in the Axiom source where you already must do this, e.g. the
src/algebra/*.spad.pamphlet files.

Anyway, I think that if you are reading the .dvi file you will
already know the names of the generated files. If you are a
developer working directly with the generated files then I
think you would know enough to check the Makefile to see how
this file is generated. But it might well be convenient if there
was a nice wrapper for

  grep '<<whatever.h>>=3D' *.pamphlet

along the lines of what Martin Rubey wrote for the
*.spad.pamphlet files.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I have a simple suggestion. Forget the Axiom user for a moment. First we 
need to have good documentation for developers. A user probably cares 
mose about the "algebra" subdirectory. I don't care too much about 
interaction with hyperdoc and such. The current pamphlet -> dvi way also 
does not involve hyperdoc.

My dream would be to have for each bigger unit one document (which is 
.dvi, .pdf or .html -- you have already seen in ALLPROSE that it is not 
so hard to generate different output formats). By "bigger unit" I 
approximately mean the subdirectories in src. Such a document would be 
similar to the ALLPROSE stuff -- hyperlinks here and there.

The question is whether other Axiom developers would like it or whether 
there are other suggestions we could agree upon. It's a lot of effort 
after all. And before I invest time there I would rather like to know in 
advance what other peoples dreams are. So that I don't have to throw 
away my stuff in the end.

Ralf

I wrote that there are three problem latexing build improvement
but in fact there are more.  Namely, Makefile mark .dvi files
as .PRECIOUS so that even if Latex fails, garbled .dvi lies on
disk and is used (skipping Latex run) on the next make run.
This can easily hide errors: it seems that I re-run make twice
and it skipped over an error.

I think that in general we should remove most .PRECIOUS rules
fom Makefile: when we get error generating a file we _want_ the
file to be re-made on the next run (after all, we want to fix
the problem and check our solution).

The Latex error is that noweb garbles Rosetta.pamphlet and Latex
fails.  I reported this prevoisly and Bill Page proviede a patch:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-10/msg00450.html

The patch I got is probably garbled by mail (in repo '\\' combination
appears at the end of lines, while in the patch it is at begining next
line), but otherwise it looks good.  I understand that it is still
hot topic but we should do something: apply the patch, skip noweb
run on plain tex or add noweb filter to protect [[ combination
(or maybe something else).

Great. I think this patch should go in as a priority since at this
time Axiom developers on a MAC still can not use svn to get Axiom.

But I almost hesitate to ask the following: Why aren't the files
in src/hyper/pages in pamphlet format? Well, ok, they do look like
latex files already but in this case they are also source files for
hyperdoc. Would including these files as chunks in a pamphlet file
present any technical problem to noweb?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I never got the time to convert them. They should be. --t

Here is a good copy of the patch

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/public/rosetta.patch

But invoke the right to change my opinion... ;)=20

>=20

Maybe "skip noweb run on plain tex" makes good sense if all files are
processed by the 'document' command. Really I cannot think of any good
excuse for the rosetta.pamphlet to actually be a pamphlet file, so
probably it's name should just be changed to rosetta.tex and 'document'
changed so that it does not preprocess files with noweave if the
file already has a .tex extension.

Bill Page.

Yes; but the root chunk corresponds to the .c files.  Most of them
look like this:

    <<*>>=
    <<license>>
    <<titlebar.c>>
    @ 

I must confess that I did not invent anything there:  I just
abstracted over the repetitions.

However, for header files, the rules look like this:

   <<header files>>=
   .PRECIOUS: $(builddir)/%.h

   $(HEADERS): $(builddir)/%.h: $(srcdir)/%.pamphlet
           $(axiom_build_document) --tangle=$*.h --output=$@ $<
   @

| I.e. patch 'document' like this:
| 
|     if [ -z $output ]; then
| -	output=`basename $file .pamphlet`;

this is when $chunk is specified.  That is doable.  We just have to
check when it is not specified and use the other rule.

The LP idea, and the pamphlet files by implication, works beautifully
when you get everything right from the start and you don't have to
look under the hood (e.g. debugging, etc.).  By definition, if you're
not using it for an evolving system -- which by definition is buggy.
By the minutes you have to deal also with the generated and
intermediate files, it becomes very very messy.

Fire!

You are right that the need for presenting the collection of Axiom
source files are references will not go away by axiom.bib.pamphlet.
We still need to links to references sections in other files.

PDF has my vote.

I very much like hyperlinks pointing to sections in other files.

But, I don't know what ALLPROSE looks like in practice (sorry, I
cannot do everything...)

>=20

I propose that we remove axiom.bib.pamphlet.

There is no axiom.bib.tex as far as I can tell - only axiom.bib.

But the idea of including citations to pamphlet files seems ill-
conceived to me. There is no documentation in the axiom.bib.pamphlet
file itself but in src/doc/Makefile.pamphlet we can read:

--------

\section{The bibtex stanza}
Axiom pamphlet files have citations. We collect all of the
pamphlet file citations into this one file so we have a standard
place and format for bibliographic references.

Citations of pamphlet files which are local are generally by the
name. For example, [[asq.c.pamphlet]] would be cited using
[[\cite{asq.c}]].=20

--------

But as far as I can tell this method is not actually used in any
other pamphlet file. Looking at the contents of axiom.bib I see
many non-unique entries.Further, I don't see how this wculd work
in the case where there are multiple root code chunks in a single
pamphlet file (e.g. algebra/*.spad.pamphlet).

I think that in future updates to the pamphlet files we should
encourage the use hyperref where relevant to include hypertex
links directly in the dvi/pdf files. See for example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/book--main--1/Endpaper3

which contains hyperlinks in the graphics.

Bill Page.

I think perhaps the pamplet files should interact with hyperdoc.
Or rather hyperdoc should be replaced with a web browser interface
that would integrate with the dvi/pdf files including hyperlinks
between them.

Ralf, I appreciate that you have put a lot of work into ALLPROSE
but when I look at it I see a tool that seems more suitable to
the user/developer of Axiom library code then to the general build
environment for Axiom. It that sense I see it as part of the type
of web browser interface that I referred to above.

But for development *my* dream really is not just bigger units but
rather a single outline for the entire Axiom project such as is
possible in Leo. This outline allows you to navigate freely just
like navigating in the src directory right down to the "chunk"
level with quick access to generated documentation, source code
and the build environment. The outline is like a tree structure
but includes "cloning" which actually creates a lattice and makes
it possible to create different "views" of the same information
without duplicating content.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I see also \cite mentioned here in the FAQ file:

FAQ 11: How do I add a new pamphlet file
...

You must also modify src/doc/axiom.bib.pamphlet to include
the file. Axiom uses bibtex to cross-reference the various=20
pamphlet files. The normal method of citing a file involves
just using the name, for example \cite{asq.c} will build
a citation to the ./src/etc/asq.c.pamphlet file.

You must include the following two lines in your pamphlet file:

\bibliographystyle{plain}
\bibliography{axiom}

Am I wrong about this?

Do you have Axiom with Aldor support installed, or, at least Aldor installed?

Do you have $ALDORROOT set?



The following should not take more than 15 minutes. If it takes longer, drop me
an email...

Go to Ralf's webpage and download packaged-allprose

tar -xzf packaged-allprose.tar.gz

cd packaged-allprose

cd combinat/trunk/combinat

make html

## or, if you actually want to use it:

I use auctex and added a dead simple "document" command. Thus I can visit a

enter document

press C-c C-c again

auctex proposes "View". But of course, the parameter is wrong, it is

name.pamphlet.dvi

instead of

name.dvi

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I fail to see a reason why simply adding the tex is a bad idea.

But very often in this Makefile business I only know half of the story, so
please don't be angry with me.

Don't take me too seriously. What I meant was that we cannot do
everything in one stroke. Of course, I care about documentation for the
end user. All of the Axiom source code should become documentation for
an end user. An end user shoul actually just find his/her way quickly to
the section of the documentation in which he/she is interested. But, in
fact, even the documentation for developers should be written in a form
that makes it easy for "users of axiom" to become "developers of axiom".
So, in fact, I don't actually distinguish too much between developer and
end user. It's just that they will read different parts.

What I care about is that the overall documentation method should be in
some sense simple. And currently we have the Axiom-book for end-users
but we have a mess for developers.

I hope that makes my intentions a bit clearer.

Understood.

For a 30 seconds impression click on

http://www.hemmecke.de/aldor/allprose/

Maybe that gives you a feeling of what I would like to see also for
axiom. (.pdf and .dvi basically look the same.)
And this is *not* just one .nw file (or .pamphlet if you like). That are
many. So in fact, it isn't really a problem to have file.c.pamphlet and
file.h.pamphlet separate, since the workflow would be: Read the .dvi and
if you find something that you want to edit, click there and suddenly
your editor opens the right file. In some sense that is like Tim's idea
of having a huge .pamphlet file, only that I have not. Only the
generated (more human readable) format is one file. The actual sources
are organised so that the build process gets simple.
Also note that all newer dvi viewers allow to search inside .dvi files. 
You can forget about grep.

>> | > The drastic way... Remove axiom.bib.pamphlet

Sorry, I take that back. Only remove (most of) the (file referencing) 
content.

I am very much in favour of having a central .bib file (or a collection 
of them in a central place), but with actual references to papers and 
books. Even better would be what once was in discussion... Online 
documentation should directly link a reference in text to the actual 
paper if that is somewhere on the internet. But I guess we also care 
about printed versions so a .bib file is not such a bad idea in the end. 
We should however care about uniqe bibkeys, that would avoid 
duplications of entries in axiom.bib.

Maybe some day .bib files go away since there would be a central 
database of references on the internet and one only has to know a unique 
key into that database to extract all relevant information needed for a 
printed version. But up to then .bib files are of some use.

If you use the right style file, you get the links to the articles quite
easily. Look for example, at

http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.CO/0604140

(click on pdf or dvi and go to the very last page)

In fact, in my community this is standard now.

But I guess you know that?

On my ia64 debian-linux workstation, apt-get refuses to install

I'm attempting to build the build-improvements branch on linux-ia64
build stops with message
Exactly one loader option must be chosen: dlopen=yes statsysbfd=no
       dynsysbfd=no locbfd=yes custreloc=no

I have only a vague idea of what these mean and no idea how to make the
choice into the build process.

This seems to be coming from configure for gcl-2.6.8pre

I am more in favour of any webbrowser than hyperdoc. Hyperdoc looks old.
The contents is what we should care about. And then I'd like to see a 
nice help system. I think Mathematica has quite a reasonable one. It 
also links to the Mathematica book. I am not an expert in that but I 
guess, we can achieve it also in a normal webbrowser. The Eclipse 
documenation would be an example.

And yes, I like some features of hyperdoc. I like to click on a category 
or a domain and see its documentation and I can ask a category for all 
domains that implement this category. That is sometimes quite helpful. 
So in a replacement of hyperdoc must be as "active" as hyperdoc is now.

OK, maybe I should say half-ALLPROSE. When I speak about ALLPROSE in the 
context of Axiom, it makes no sense to carry over all of the build 
procedures that are in there. Only that related to documentation is 
perhaps relevant at the moment for Axiom.  It basically concerns some 
.sty files and some conventions of how documentation should be written.

Bill, believe me, I am actually on your side. But there are a few problems.

First. I did not find Leo too attractive to me since it does not 
actually enforce an LP style.

Second. Although I like this idea with different views (oh that would be 
the "crystal idea" right?) on code+documentation, it becomes harder to 
actually write the documentation so that it stays human readable. The 
question namely is: What are the smallest resonable units that can be 
moved around and included in other views. If you change the content of 
one unit, it also has influence on another "view" where this unit is used.

So my current position is a bit hesitant although I like this 
"multiple-views" thing.

I've used the "-L" notangle option to great effect when writing C code
with noweb. Even gdb can find the proper source lines.

The crucial part _is_ in a pamphlet file: the files contain extracts
from Axiom book.  We just do not know (yet) how to extract them.
.pht file should be machine generated (from corresponding .ht), but
to make this process automatic one needs to fix some bugs in Axiom
(and to build without X11 we need a version of hypertex and graphic
which does not use X11).

Actually, by volume, the biggest part of .ht files are NAG manuals.  
AFAICS they were converted from other form into plain text format
and then embedded into hypertex verbatim blocks.  Proper treatement
of those files would require adding logical markup.  OTOH I am not
sure if we want to maintain NAG manuals at all -- if we switch to
a different numerical library we need different manuals.

I very much support that. But what you write after the -L depends on the 
programming language that notangle spits out. Seeing #line statements in 
a generated .bib file, is maybe not such a good idea.

As I said earlier, I would rather like to see generic rules  than having 
always to look at the Makefile what actually happens. Distinguishing 
according to filetypes is probably ok, there are not too many types 
around. But I would like to see no exceptions to general rules on a

ATM most Makfiles (and 'config/setup-dep.mk) contain rules of the sort:

.PRECIOUS: %.tex
.PRECIOUS: %.dvi
.PRECIOUS: %.o

I think that blank .PRECIOUS is may be justified _only_ for self-modifying
Makefiles.  All other files need strong justification.

Apparently the build-improvments ./configure script does not find
bfd.h and libbfd on your system so it chooses to try to build gcl
with --disable-statsysbfd --enable-locbfd which unfortunately
seems to conflict with gcl's default for the ia64 platform.

You could try to build and install gcl first before attempting to
build build-improvements. That would allow you to specify the exact
options to use with gcl. I suggest:

$ tar xzf ~/build-improvements/zips/gcl-2.6.8pre.tgz
$ cd gcl-2.6.8pre
$ ./configure --prefix=3D/usr/local --disable-dlopen =
--disable-statsysbfd
\
--enable-locbfd --enable-vssize=3D65536*2 --enable-maxpage=3D256*1024 \
--disable-x --disable-xgcl --disable-tkconfig
$ make
$ make install

If that succeeds, then continue with build-improvements using

$ cd ~/build-improvments
$ ./configure --prefix=3D/usr/local --with-gcl
$ make

Bill Page.

What does your 'document' command do?

I presume that it runs noweave and latex to create the dvi
file?

Why does emacs simply assume .dvi should be appended? Is this
because it does not know that .pamphlet files create .dvi
files? I presume that if the file ends in .tex then the
parameter that emacs proposes would not be

  name.tex.dvi

which would be wrong in most cases.

Perhaps you can somehow configure emacs so that .pamphlet is
similar to .tex as an extension and should be ignored when
proposing the parameter for tex-view?

>=20

I do not think "anger" would be appropriate here... :-)

I would give the following reasons why it is bad:

1) All other programs that I can think of that process an
   input file with a given extension, generate output files
   by replacing the extension with one appropriate to the
   output. E.g.

     latex name.tex --> name.dvi
     dvipdfm name.dvi --> name.pdf

   In latex this happens even if the extension is not .tex

     latex name.pamphlet --> name.dvi

   It would be very strange to see

     latex name.tex --> name.tex.dvi
     dvipdfm name.tex.dvi --> name.tex.dvi.pdf

   wouldn't it?

2) File names with more than one . are may not be portable to
   non-linux file systems - although the only ones I can think of
   are old and unlikely candidates for Axiom.

3) Files with unnecessarily long names are more awkward to use.

Ok I admit that reasons 2) and 3) are not very strong reasons...

Regards,
Bill Page.

That is an argument. But perhaps for all those of us who are not so 
familiar with non-Linux, it would be more helpful to say which systems 
these are. The only system I know would be DOS. But then forget about 
the .pamphlet extension. You only have 3 characters. ;-)

Anything else that cannot handle 2 dots or long filenames?

Not even 1) is a reason. Why do you believe one can say

make dvi

in ALLPROSE and then say

xdvi myalps.dvi

to get the whole documentation although I have the convention
notangle removes .nw
noweave adds .tex  (result is .nw.tex)
?

There will never be generated anything else than one dvi file. And I 
don't understand, why people care so much about the names of 
intermediate files. You can remove .nw.tex files and no harm is done. If 
make would already remove them, one would not even see what strange 
things are done under the hat.
But that naming scheme simplifies the understanding of the system (only 
in my opinion, of course). One doesn't have to rename axiom.sty.pamphlet 
to axiom-sty.pamphlet.

So the only reason I see not to just add ".tex" would be portability. 
But which are systems we want to build Axiom on that cannot handle two dots?

move-if-change solves only part of the problem: if you have a file
which has dependency newer than the file itself make will try
to rebuild the file on _every_ run.  Even if extraction is not very
expensive the cost of extracting and then discarding exctracted version
may quickly accumulate.  AFAICS within make paradigm one would need
_two_ times: modification time and update time.  File needs update
if its update time is before modification time of one of its dependencies.
However, if update do not change file content only update time changes,
modification time would stay the same.  But I do not know of a make like
tool which offers such model (possibly because normal filesystems do
not provide a way to store update time).

I think older CDrom formats also had this sort of limitation

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_9660

and still cause some trouble in rare cases with very long file
names.

Good question. If the rule is "add .tex" then the result is

  latex myalps.nw.tex --> myalps.nw.dvi

not myalps.dvi. You must be doing something more to hide the .nw.

Your suggestion would require that we use awkwqard names like

  xdvi axiom.sty.pamphlet.dvi

No?

I don't think anyone is that worried about internal file names,
but this discussion is about making the makefiles "simpler" and
more obvious, so we do care what goes on under the hat, right?
Using a file name for dvi files that retains the original
.pamphlet extension is not so obvious to me.

In my opinion it is only an accident that axiom.sty.pamphlet
has this name and contains only one root chunk. In general this
is not the case.

I would guess: none.

I think the help system is extremely important, especially in such a
complex tool as Axiom.  Linking to the book will be somewhat tricky
though - we need to think carefully about what to link to for any given
type of help request, and possibly even write documentation with such
requests in mind in order to help make it more "searchable".  Whether
this meshes well with book style documentation I am not yet sure.

Definitely agree!

I don't think that's in doubt.  Once we achieve ANSI lisp compliance
there are a number of interesting things that could be attempted in this
department.  One might be to explore the idea of using Lisp based http
server tools as a general communications protocol between all front ends
- things like Uncommon Web http://common-lisp.net/project/ucw/ and
http://www.cliki.net/araneida may prove useful in that respect.  Kai and
I talked about this briefly on IRC - one option might be to use araneida
as the "gateway" part of the client-server system.  Different clients
might not care to speak html, of course, but I doubt if there is any
fundamental reason we couldn't send arbitrary data down the pipe and
have araneida farm it out to the appropriate input handler.  I still
think McCLIM offers some very intriguing potential for an Axiom
interface in such a framework.  Anyway, interesting possibilities.

Perhaps that could be changed?  Or is the design of the tool not
compatible with such a requirement?  I do like the idea of the tools
enforcing the literate programming paradigm - it's too easy to get
sidetracked.  (Of course, we're going to need several hour long
"training videos" on how to work with the Axiom source code, sorta like
that SLIME tutorial movie.)

I do have to agree there.

I think the end consequence of such a method is that we will have to
write very small, "self contained" documentation for units that will be
used multiple places, and then "plug them in" to larger components.  I'm
dubious that discrete units below the scale of an academic paper will
prove really useful, but at a minimum it should be possible to (say)
document various TeX output formatting code (let's say I add knowledge
of siunits in a unit pamphlet, and someone else adds some chemistry
specific LaTeX output methods in a chemistry pamphlet) as part of the
original pamphlet, and then use a different view to collect all of the
various TeX output methods into a single view that could produce one
document describing all TeX output methods.  In this fashion, a general
change to all TeX output routines (for a new TeX distribution, say)
could be carried out very rapidly across many distinct categories,
without risk of "missing one" due to having to look at dozens or
hundreds of individual documents to check for special TeX output routines.

It may prove that the only really useful unit is the code chunk itself,
with the views being documents into which they plug in.  But if we could
as a chunk we were editing what views (documents) it was included in,
and check each of them before we commit the change, we could at least
keep everything consistent with a high degree of confidence and convenience.

> So my current position is a bit hesitant although I like this
> "multiple-views" thing.

I think it needs exploring, which I suppose means I need to take another
good hard run at Leo.  Such a setup also means we would need to "chunk"
the whole source code pretty much at the outset, and then fit in the
pieces - correct?  That's a mean job even without adding documentation,
but I suppose it would be a benefit in any case.

Cheers,
CY

I don't have Axiom support on the machine I usually work with.

I did some work earlier on the bibliography question and got pretty
close to something I would be happy with, it is still available on my
Axiom portal site:

http://portal.axiom-developer.org/Members/starseeker/axiombibliographysystem.tar.gz/file_view
http://portal.axiom-developer.org/Members/starseeker/axiombibliography.pdf/file_view

I suppose the pdf structuring part is of less interest to most, but I
also was able to use the ToC style files to generate links from the
bibliography to some of the online sources (not all - more work is
needed for sources Axiom would want).

Also, this bib file allows a comments section on each source.  I would
suggest this a a preferable way to have a "literate" bib file - it
remains a valid bib file, can be referenced directly by all documents
without any complications, and can still include comments on the
document by us - which to me should be sort of the best of all possible
worlds.  If it MUST be a pamphlet I would suggest that the noweb part
generate, if possible, the simple file to incorporate the bib file and
explain our conventions, plus the bib file itself.  I doubt any purpose
would be served by adding in the bib entries as "source code" in a
document, but of course I may be wrong.

Cheers,
CY

Yes.  This problem has many roots.  Part of it is that
build-improvements extracts the TeX file in the same directory as it
latexs it.  The problem can be papered over in many different way:
  (1) add .tex unconditionally.
  (2) replace .pamphlet with .tex and pay attention
  (3) extract to a different directory
  (4) find a btter solution.

That means, you have axiom and aldor installed, but they don't work together
yet?

Well, meanwhile Ralf gave you an easier way to get an impression for
ALLPROSE. Just in case you want Axiom to support Aldor on your machine, here
are the instructions:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AldorForAxiom

Although I guess that you know that anyway.

BTW, is it planned to have a debian package with support for Aldor built-in?

It seems that gcl on ia64 can only use dlopen.  Axiom tries to force
gcl to use bdf library (which is better solution when it works).  So you
should probably build gcl separately with default settings.

debian testing has Xlib.h in libx11-dev.

I don't understand. In what way is it special? To me it looks
just like any other "header" file and could easily be a chunk
in some other latex-related file.

It seems to me the only peculiarity here is with the latex
command as reported by Waldek:

http://www.mail-archive.com/axiom-developer@nongnu.org/msg07222.html

that when given the command:

  \usepackage{axiom}

by default looks for

  axiom.sty.tex

in the current directory even though the common practice is to name
the file

  axiom.sty

and to locate it in the shared texmf file tree. To me this is
strange and unexpected. I cannot find this behaviour documented
anywhere on the web. So it looks like a bug in tex to me.

Changing axiom.sty.pamphlet to axiom-sty.pamphlet and added a
chunk named <<asxiom.sty>>=3D still seems like the right thing to
do to avoid this "bug". I one sentence explanation in the pamphlet
file should be enough documentation for such a simple change that
is otherwise consistent with the rest of the Axiom source code.

Regards,
Bill Page.

                 ^^^^^

sorry, that should read "Aldor".

no, that I don't have Aldor (or course, Axiom is installed).

Yes.

[...]

| BTW, is it planned to have a debian package with support for Aldor built-in?

I don't know.  I've decided not to spend too much time on Aldor as far
as it is free only in promises.  I'm concentratig on Axiom and SPAD.

That is a bug.  Ideally, Axiom (build-improvements, that is) should
NOT decide itself on the configure options.  However, GCL should be
able to detect that BFD is missing (or present) and decide accordingly.
Now, I rememebr Humberto asked recently what --enable-custreloc was
about.  It was put there a very long time ago.  But since then GCL's
configure's gotten smarter and needs not be told about that.  Those
are bugs that should be corrected.

I'm not disagreeing with that.  I'm explaning, *why* from my
perspective, that exception to the general rule is acceptable -- even
when I don't find it perfect or don't like it.

Axiom Developers,

Well, here's our next target for Axiom build-improvements:

http://www.flypentop.com/view/page.home/home?s=3Dalgebra

Maybe we will have to seriously consider cross-compilation
afterall. :-)

Bill Page.

PS. I want one for Christmas!

On Mac OS X 10.4 using XCode 2.2 I need to #include <util.h> instead.

Summary: Latex on Compile Farm

Initial Comment:
Axiom uses literate programming. In order to use
the compile farm machines we need to have latex
installed. Latex is fairly standard software that
has been around for 20 years so it is not experimental.
Most distributions have it installed.

Axiom runs on a wide range of hardware and we need
the compile farm to test. 

Is it possible to have it installed on the compile 
farm machines?

This should be installed on most of the compile farm
machines (having trouble getting it installed on a couple).
 Please let me know if there's a specific machine you need
it on, that doesn't already have it.

It looks like latex is still not available on the MAC OSX 10.2 server.

I still don't see a reason that makes axiom.sty.pamphlet special.
First one extracts any file via notangle (tex is completely irrelevant 
here). Then one transforms pamphlets to .tex files (tex is still 
irrelevant). Now you have all the generated files you need to start the 
latex process. From that point of view even axiom.sty is not special. 
There is no bootstrapping problem.

Is there someone who wants to earn money for finding a bug in TeX? I can 
report that in the TeXBook I have not found clearly stated that \input 
always appends the .tex extension although in all cases that are given 
as examples the .tex extension is missing and always something like 
\input story refers to story.tex.

That could perhaps be considered a bug in the TeXBook. I haven't checked 
the literate source of TeX, since \input is a TeX primitive.

But life is not so easy if you look into latex.ltx. The \input in LaTeX 
is redefined so that one can write

   \input{file}

instead of

   \input file

(in fact, one can do both).

Anyway, it all boils down to

\@@input axiom.sty

where \@@input is the original TeX primitive.

OK, let's make an experiment that doesn't involve LaTeX.

%%%BEGIN aaa.tex
\input aaa.sty
\bye
%%%END aaa.tex

%%%BEGIN aaa.sty
\message{======= I am aaa.sty =======}
%%%END aaa.sty

%%%BEGIN aaa.sty.tex
\message{======= I am aaa.sty.tex =======}
%%%END aaa.sty.tex

 >tex aaa.tex
This is TeX, Version 3.14159 (Web2C 7.4.5)
(./aaa.tex (./aaa.sty.tex ======= I am aaa.sty.tex =======) )
No pages of output.
Transcript written on aaa.log.

You can replace "sty" by "bbb" if you like.

Since when you compile axiom.sty.tex also axiom.sty must be in the path 
\usepackage will always take axiom.sty.tex instead. So the option of 
moving the files to another place does not help since they must be 
visible at the same time.

Most of you opt now for renaming axiom.sty.pamphlet to something else 
(like axiom-sty.pamphlet). I rather like to see the general rule that 
the generation should go

noweave file.pamphlet > file.pamphlet.tex

no matter how many dots are in "file".

Up to now I have only heard about MS-DOS and old CD formats that 
restrict more flexible names. Both also have the 8+3 restriction so they 
are actually out anyway if we stick to .pamphlet.

Why would you accept even a single exception if you can have something 
without it?

Wow. I must be doing something wrong. I already question whether I 
should use German to get my idea through. English doesn't seem to work. ;-)

OK. Let me repeat. In ALLPROSE and any project that is built with 
ALLPROSE there are many files. All of them have the extension .nw 
(forget about README, GPL and that). Actually all have a second 
extension. So the general form is file.ext.nw. Now my Makefile basically 
have the rule that notangle removes .nw and noweave adds .tex.

There is only *one* dvi file that will be produced and *not* one for 
every .nw file. So "xdvi axiom.sty.pamphlet.dvi" is absolutely no 
argument. One should not even look at something like 
axiom.sty.pamphlet.tex, because that is generated and could look like a 
big mess --- if you have really looked at files that come out of noweave 
you will know that theses files are not for humans even if they are .tex 
files.

So now the trick why I don't have myalps.nw.dvi.

The top-level project file is called myalps.tex.nw. Applying my rules 
gives myalps.tex and myalps.tex.nw.tex. The first one is just a wrapper 
that in shortended form looks like

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{allprose}
\begin{document}
\author{Ralf Hemmecke}
   \title{\xProject{} \LIBRARYVERSION}}
   \maketitle
   \begin{abstract}
   ...
   \end{abstract}
\hypertarget{sec:Contents}{}\tableofcontents
\input{\projectname.tex.nw}
\end{document}

and that will be latex'ed. As you can see, it's some kind of template.
And my Makefiles make sure that the setup will be such that all other 
.nw.tex files will be included into the documentation.


There is another point that speaks against the current practise of 
translating each .pamphlet file into one .dvi, namely "literate 
programming". Ideas don't just live in one file. That completely misses 
the point that there are relations from one part of the system to 
another. For example, there should not be 5 Makefile.dvi files lying 
around in different directories. Since the build procedure should be 
described as a whole.

It would better to describe the interpreter as a whole rather than 
producing a .dvi file for each of the 187 files in src/interp.
Tim's approach (if I understood that correctly) is to make *one* huge 
.pamphlet file.
My approach is to have as many pamphlet file as you like but produce 
*one* human readable document from all of them to describe a _unit_ 
(i.e. the interpreter).

Eventually, we perhaps want just one document (a web-site, for example) 
that describe all of axiom (including the source code). For a web site 
the size doesn't matter. But still, there should be some backlinks from 
the human-readable format (.dvi) to the actual .pamphlets.

Of course, we care about Makefiles and conventions and such but as long 
as that becomes simple, generated file names can be complicated.

I hope, this time my English is understandable.

I agree. Other opinions concerning filename portability?

(3) is not an option, since when you compile axiom.sty.tex --> 
axiom.sty.dvi then it does not matter whether axiom.sty is visible or 
not. \usepackage will choose the wrong file.

You should not forget to mention how the .tex name (which is only
internal) is converted to a .dvi name (which is visible to all
users). If you use latex with no extra processing then Rule 2
implies

  latex file.pamphlet.tex  --> file.pamphlet.dvi

-------

The rule used in the current Axiom make files is also simple
(Rule 1) :

  noweave file.pamphlet > file.tex
  latex file.tex   --> file.dvi
 =20

I do not understand your point of view. As far as I can see there
is *no* exception to the either Rule 1 or Rule 2! What do you think
is violated by the use of the "axiom-sty.pamphlet" file name?

Perhaps you are really concerned about a different more implicit
rule (Rule 3) :

  The 'file' part of the file.pamphlet name should the same as the
  "name" of the program in the file - in other words the same as
  the name of a code chunk in the file.

Of course if there is only one such code chunk then it is natural
to try to make these names the same or at least similar. But the
application of Rule 3 is not always straightforward. If there is
more than one program or style file in the pamphlet file there
will be multiple code chunk names.

>=20

There is *no* exception to the rule whether we choose Rule 1 or
Rule 2.

If we try to apply *both* Rule 1 and Rule 3, without renaming
axiom.sty.pamphlet to axiom-sty.pamphlet, then in this single
case of a file continuing a code chunk named <<axiom.sty>>=3D the
result is a conflict with the behavior of latex.

If we apply *both* Rule 2 and Rule 3, then yes this single
problem case is avoided. BUT *all* the names of all the dvi
files and the internal .tex files will change to include the
extra 'pamphlet' suffix.

But if we admit just *one more* exception to Rule 3 (there are
already many exceptions to Rule 3 in the src/algebra files),
then the combination of Rule 1 and Rule 3 is ok because we are
not obliged to make the file name and the chunk name the same
even though at this time there is only one code chunk in the
axiom-sty.pamphlet file. And we do not change any of the other
names of the intermediate .tex or external .dvi files.

-----------

Ok. I think that really is my last word on this subject! :-) In
the end I will agree to either of these choices. I just think
that Rule 1 with a small compromise to Rule 3 is the most simple
and easy approach. Obviously both methods will solve the problem.

Bill Page.

Can I quote a sentence of yours? "Be more specific." ;-)
What was unclear in the TeX example I gave?

Ok, thank you! I finally understand what you are saying. :-)

  axiom.sty.pamphlet.tex

is never processed by

  latex axiom.sty.pamphlet.tex

Maybe it would be much less confusing if these files did not have
the extension .tex. Why not something like

  axiom.sty.pamphlet.inc

to make it clear that we will not be directly apply latex to this
file?

Ok, so this is a file that we do not currently have in any of the
Axiom directories, right? We would have to create at least one for
each src directory.

Yes, I like your approach much more than Tim's book volumes even
though the end result for the user is nearly the same. Nice.

Yes certainly. I don't think the problem is your English. It

But now I understand, I do feel like I have to take a step back
and because this is an even bigger change then what I incorrectly
thought you were suggesting - instead of changing nearly 1000 files
we would probably be reducing the number of dvi files to less than
100. I think that might take some planning - as you originally
suggested - but I am starting to agree that the result would be
worth it.

Thanks again for your patience.

It is ironic that we're agreeing, but we seem to think we disagree.

Let me explain again.  The *current* situation is that we have
axiom.sty.pamphlet, from which we extract axiom.sty.  Everything is
OK.  Except that for very obscure reasons, it does not seem to work
properly when LaTeXinig that specific file (sorry, Ralf, the more yyou
explain, the less I become convinced we should just add .tex).  
*A* solution is to rename the source file to axiom-sty.pamphlet, which
departs from the original naming.  axiom-sty.pamphlet is the only file
to go through that mutification.

| Perhaps you are really concerned about a different more implicit
| rule (Rule 3) :
| 
|   The 'file' part of the file.pamphlet name should the same as the
|   "name" of the program in the file - in other words the same as
|   the name of a code chunk in the file.

No.

| Of course if there is only one such code chunk then it is natural
| to try to make these names the same or at least similar. But the
| application of Rule 3 is not always straightforward. If there is
| more than one program or style file in the pamphlet file there
| will be multiple code chunk names.

yes; of course.  From my perspective, the basename should match a
logical unit, that also cleanly translates to automation.

[...]

| Ok. I think that really is my last word on this subject! :-) In
| the end I will agree to either of these choices. I just think
| that Rule 1 with a small compromise to Rule 3 is the most simple
| and easy approach. Obviously both methods will solve the problem.

For the record, I think that the renaming is my favoured option.

No.  It depends on where you call LaTeX from and the value of TEXINPUTS.

Ah, one last remark. I don't yet have a complete understanding of LEO, 
but, in fact, what I am suggesting now should not prevent us from 
introducing LEO at a later stage (I think). Noweb files are noweb files. 
LEO maintains them in some way I suggest to do it in another way (maybe 
only because I did not understand LEO). Whether the compilation to dvi 
is achieved through a set of Makefile rules and perl scripts (in my 
case) or through LEO is just a matter of the tool. The .nw files should 
be the same.

And thank you, Bill. I really should change "appending .tex" to 
"appending .texinclude" or something like that. I have to explore first 
what implications that has to my srcltx setup, but with a little 
TeX-hacking that should work.

Are you so sure? Where should I branch from for that experiment?

Ralf,

I think what Gaby is suggesting is that aaa.tex would be extracted
to some directory other than the current directory, e.g.

  $ noweave axiom.sty.pamphlet > intermediate/axiom.sty.tex

then presumably calling

  $ tex intermediate/axiom.sty.tex

even though it contains

  \usepackage{axiom.sty)

will not look for axiom.sty in the intermediate directory -
only the current directory.

Your test did not test this case.

Try this:

$ mkdir intermediate

Create the file 'intermediate/axiom.sty.tex'

%%%BEGIN intermediate/axiom.sty.tex
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{axiom}
\begin{document}
test
\end{document}
%%%END intermediate/axiom.sty.tex

Now create 'axiom.sty.tex' file in the current directory

%%%BEGIN axiom.sty.tex
\message{=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D I am axiom.sty.tex =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D}
%%%END axiom.sty.tex

Plus two 'axiom.sty' files - one in the current directory

%%%BEGIN axiom.sty
\message{=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D I am just axiom.sty =
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D}
%%%END axiom.sty

and one in the intermediate directory

%%%BEGIN intermediate/axiom.sty
\message{=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D I am intermediate/axiom.sty =
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D}
%%%END intermediate/axiom.sty

Remember also that we still have the axiom.sty file in the share
texmf directory tree and tex appropriately initialized to look
for it there. That makes three 'axiom.sty' files in all.

--------

Now from the current directory run

$ latex intermediate/axiom.sty.tex
This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)
entering extended mode

(./axiom.sty.aux) )
Output written on axiom.sty.dvi (1 page, 216 bytes).
Transcript written on axiom.sty.log.

---------

So indeed, \usepackage{axiom} does cause latex to look in the
*current* directory for 'axiom.sty.tex'.

What happens if we rename 'axiom.sty.tex' and try again?

$ mv axiom.sty.tex axiom.sty.tex_old

$ latex intermediate/axiom.sty.tex
This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)

(./axiom.sty.aux) )
Output written on axiom.sty.dvi (1 page, 216 bytes).
Transcript written on axiom.sty.log.

----------

Now the devil finds 'axiom.sty' in the current directory!

Finally, let's rename 'axiom.sty' and try a 3rd time.

$ mv axiom.sty axiom.sty_old

$ latex intermediate/axiom.sty.tex
This is pdfeTeX, Version 3.141592-1.21a-2.2 (Web2C 7.5.4)

(./axiom.sty.aux)
[1] (./axiom.sty.aux) )
Output written on axiom.sty.dvi (1 page, 216 bytes).
Transcript written on axiom.sty.log.

---------

Finally success. latex finds the copy of axiom.sty where it is
supposed to - in the share texmf tree (no messages).

Summary: One way to solve this stupid problem is to extract the
.tex file to an intermediate directory different from the current
directory when we run latex.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yes a new branch! I strongly encourage you to do that. :-)

I am just a little uncertain of the technical implications for
merging later, but I suggest that you clone build-improvements -
primarily because I think it represents the best environment in
which to experiment with alternate build scripts. It is more
modular than Axiom Gold and once you get used to it, autoconf
really does make things simpler and easier to understand.

Gaby, what do you think about branching from build-improvements?

Regards,
Bill Page.

That makes perfect sense to me.  Ralf can sync from build-improvements

So, you want expand (cos (2*x)) giving you: 

             2         2
    - sin(x)  + cos(x)

Well, rischNormalize will not help you doing this.  My point was
that rischNormalize can collapse rather compilcated expressions to
zero (ATM rischNormalize handles only expressions in one variable,
but the method is general and it should be easy to make own version
which handles arbitrary many variables).  

I think you need your own package -- rischNormalize may help you
write it.

Axiom Developers;

Over a year ago we were discussing how best to represent Axiom's
algebra dependency graph. This is a complex problem because Axiom
has over 1,300 mathematically modules that are tightly integrated
with each other - even to the point of generating a large number
cyclical dependency chains in the underlying code. This considerably
complicates bootstrap process by which Axiom is built and could
even call into question the fundamental means by which these
dependency loops are solved in the current build (e.g. It is known
that just a single iteration of bootstrap -> compile -> bootstrap
is not sufficient to produce a fixed point solution.)

A Java graph theory-based package is also currently used as part
of the build process for the Axiom Aldor extension written by
Peter Broadbery. I believe that Peter is currently re-writing this
graph package (in Aldor?) so that the Axiom Aldor extensions can
be built as part of the Axiom build without requiring Java. Ralf
Hemmecke and I had previously started work on a graphics package
for Axiom/Aldor but time constraints and other priorities have
resulted in no new progress over the last several months.

Anyway, I think I may have finally stumbled across some open source
graphics software that might be up to the task of visualizing and
manipulating Axiom's dependency graph and it may well also be a
suitable model for developing a native graphics package for Axiom.

https://networkx.lanl.gov/wiki

High productivity software for complex networks

NetworkX (NX) is a Python package for the creation, manipulation,
and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex
networks.

Features:

* Allows for 1M+ nodes, 10M+ edges
* Includes standard graph-theoretic and statistical physics functions
* Easy exchange of network algorithms between applications,
  disciplines, and platforms
* Includes many classic graphs and synthetic networks
* Nodes and edges can be "anything" (e.g. time-series, text,
  images, XML records)
* Exploits existing code from high-quality legacy software in C,
  C++, Fortran, etc.
* Open source (encourages community input)

------------

It is also notable that the Sage developers have chosen to
integrate NetworkX into Sage rather than build their own graphics
package. The Sage Graph Theory project

http://sage-wiki.axiom-developer.org/graph

has produced a very interesting review of open source graphics
programs. See:

http://sage-wiki.axiom-developer.org/graph_survey

If anyone else is interested in discussing the development and
use of a graph theory package for Axiom, I would be very glad
to hear from you.

Regards,
Bill Page.

AFAICS x^2-2 and x^2-3 have no common 0, so ideal generated by
the two polynomials is generated by constant 1.  The constant does
not depend on z2 and z3, and Axiom chokes (Axiom definitely needs
better error checking).

BTW.  You probably wanted:

primitiveElement([z2^2-2, z3^2-3], [z2,z3])

which gives me:

                          1  3   19    1  3    9           4      2

Type: Record(coef: List Integer,poly: List SparseUnivariatePolynomial Fraction Integer,prim: SparseUnivariatePolynomial Fraction Integer)

(I did not check if this is correct, but looks sensible).

I believe extending SPAD to understand "extend" (no pun intended)

I'm interested in a graph theory package for Axiom (but I have no
immediate interest in graphics).  I got a copy of "Computational
Discrete Mathematics", by Sriram Pemmaraju and Steven Skiena, to get an
idea of existing work in the area of symbolic computations.  I'm not
done with it yet.

Yep. When Gaby was saying something about "from where latex is called" 
that made me test this situation. You are right. In that way we can 
avoid to rename axiom.sty.pamphlet no matter what naming scheme we agree 
upon. The only problem that remains is srcltx. It works as I have it now 
and I have to investigate how to twist that. But I already have an idea.

Maybe it doesn't matter to much from where I branch since I intend to do 
the first approximation with my own Makefiles. What I currently have in 
ALLPROSE seems to be in conflict with autoconf (I generate Makefiles and 
things that are included in Makefiles on the fly).

I would be happy to discuss later how this could be integrated with 
build-improvements. But, in fact, it is rather independent of that.
Still though I am currently reading about autoconf and also want to add 
autoconf facilities to ALLPROSE, maybe it is easier for me to learn 
something about autoconf if I branch from build-improvements.

It seems that I am going to have some sleepless nights coming. ;-)

I did some thinking about a graph theory package. If anybody is interested, I
can write up what I believe after November 19.

Martin, I think it would be great if you could write up something
about a graph theory package for Axiom. I have been watching
with great interest your work on Combinat and I wonder if some
of the same methods would also apply in the more general setting
of Graphs.

I would of cource also be interested in what you believe about
graph theory before November 19. :-)

Is humour based on English ambiguity too obvious?

Bill Page.

No. I think that Martin meant that he will write something up today if 
someone is interested. I am interested. ;-)

I'll write something up as soon as possible. But this won't be before
November~19, since I'm under pressure until then.

However, I talked a bit with Ralf about this before the axiom workshop, and
then I think he was more interested in graphs as datastructures, which doesn't
interest me at all.

I'm into Matroids, Simplicial Complexes, Graphs, Digraphs, Polytopes etc. I
have thought only about Categories, not implementations.

But I didn't get very far anyway.

Martin

I built gcl manually per suggestion. Based on suggestions
I used the following configure command:

./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
--enable-vssize=65536*2 --enable-maxpage=256*1024 \
--disable-x --disable-xgcl --disable-tkconfig

After installing gcl, I configured Axiom:
./configure --with-gcl

During make, I have problem with bootsys:

If this problem persists after re-building with a fresh copy of
the Axiom source (see below), it might be a bit hard to diagnose
with only the information above. :-) My first suggestion is to
look for the possibility of another error somewhere earlier in
the build.

Since this looks like the error occurred quite early in the Axiom
build process, the problem might be a gcl problem so it would
also probably be worthwhile to double check the log of the gcl
build. You could try also some simple confidence tests of gcl's
ability to save a working system such as:

  $ gcl
  > (+ 1 1)
  > (si::save-system "gcl-test1")

  $ ./gcl-test1
  > (+ 1 1)
  > (compiler::link nil "gcl-test2")
  > (quit)

  $ ./gcl-test2
  > (+ 1 1)
  > (quit)

If you get stuck, it might be useful if you could make a copy of
the console log available for review.

I recommend that you do an "out of source" build. This means
that Axiom is built in a different directory then where the
source distribution exists.

To do this, first use svn to check-out a clean copy of the
Axiom source to some directory, e.g. ~/axiom.improvements.
After that you will not change anything in that directory.
Instead, create a 2nd directory, e.g.

  $ mkdir ~/axiom.build
  $ cd ~/axiom.build
  $ ../axiom.improvements/configure --with-gcl

This will setup the ~/axiom.build directory with just the
subdirectories and makefiles needed for the build. Then

  $ make

builds all of the axiom intermediate files and the final target
in this 2nd directory.

If the build fails and you want to start entirely from scratch
then just delete the contents of this directory and issue the
configure command again:

  $ rm -rf *
  $ ../axiom.improvements/configure --with-gcl

Regards,
Bill Page.

Maybe that should go to the wiki. BuildAxiom perhaps? (That page seems 
to be out of date somehow.)

I hope to make the future entry unnecessary.  Academic deadlines took
precedence over Axiom plans, so...

I'm testing Waldek and Humberto's patch to allow build on MAC OS.
Then, I'll look into some of the Makefile bugs (hopefully, there
should be very few).

I very much appreciate the number of testings, interest and feddback
going into the build-improvements.  That pressure helps keep me up :-)

hthits already includes <sys/types.h>.  Is there any reason why you
would include it a second time?

  \section{hthits.c}
+
+ This source file implements HyperDoc's ability to scan files for a
+ given pattern.  For that purpose it needs a ``regex'' for string
+ pattern matching.
+
+ This source file used to rely on [[<regexp.h>]],
+ which was originally part of the X/Open System Interface and Headers
+ Issue 2.  However, since then, it has been withdrawn and no longer
+ always available on newer platfroms.  Consequently,
+ we need to use a different, portable regex library.  The POSIX
+ definition provides one, namely through [[<regex.h>]].  That is what we
+ use now.  Its availability is tested at configure time.

I think it's more like you need to run configure after a make clean, 
even if you don't specify any prefix it will work, but

make clean; make

fails with the permission problem on /bin/gcl (I think a GCLDIR 
configuration variable is being blown away). I'm sorry I haven't had the 
time to fix this yet.

Hello,


The chunk/file presea (in src/hyper/search.pamphlet) contains
'#!/bin/awk -f' which does not work on my Debian system (awk is
under /usr/bin). I know that there is a variable for awk, so maybe this
can help.

Always in src/hyper/search.pamphlet, the chunk/file htsearch uses
'sort ... +number ...' which issues a warning on my system :
sort: Warning: "+number" syntax is deprecated, please use "-k number"

You can reproduce these issues when you click, in Hyperdoc, the
hyperlink browse->reference.

Greg

PS : I will report these issues on IssueTracker.

Hello,

For those who are fed up to click on arrow keys in Hyperdoc (I'm) here
is patch against Hyperdoc. This patch is for personal use and is not
documented (I know nothing about the X libraries). It adds support of
the mouse wheel (dirty hack !!!).

I insist, this patch is experimental, I just coded it in 30 minutes.
Comments and critics are welcome of course.

Greg

PS : Next thing, allow to type text when NumLock is enabled, but I will
probably not do it in the near future.

Looking at document script I noticed that it normally uses unquoted
values, which may cause trouble with embedded spaces.  So I decided
to try building axiom in a directory which contained space in its
name. Configure worked nice, but build failed immediatly...

The following removes the warning.  OTOH I am not sure if all our
potential targets support '-k' option to sort.

Thanks. This was very helpful. I still have the problem, however.
I agree it appears to be a gcl problem. I didn't see any thing in the
gcl build log and the save-system and compiler::link tests
given above both appeared to work fine. I did try to run this manually:

I did make a feeble attempt to provide more info with :bt and :env
I would like to debug this but my knowledge of lisp is pretty limited.
My knowledge of ia64 is much better.

I also tried to do (si:use-fast-links nil) but that gets segfault
Alos, if I just try gdb stage0/bootsys when I give run, it crashes

Interesting, somebody knows about our potential targets. Where are they 
listed? Isn't that relevant of how portable Axiom should become? I would 
actually like to see two lists.

1) Where does Axiom currently compile and/or run?
2) Where should Axiom compile and/or run? (Future plans)

I would like to see Axiom run (ideally) wherever GCC runs,
e.g. desktops, laptops, etc.  I do not insist on 16K memory machines
though :-)

Do you have a link to a list of systems for GCC?

OK. But there were actually two questions (if not more). Or do you mean 
by "run" also "compile" on these machines?

Maybe it is much too early in the current development process to think 
about it, but I have the feeling that for the end-user it is not so much 
important that he can actually build Axion on his system from scratch.

It would be of course a feature (or a must) that people can extend an 
already running Axiom. But I guess some people will never extend Axiom 
but rather be happy with .input files. That all says something about how 
powerful the machine must be to do certain things. Clearly, "running on 
some system" and "compiling on some system" is not the same thing.

The list of *known reports* (which is not the same as supported) is here:
 
  http://gcc.gnu.org/buildstat.html

I would like to see Axiom support native build for a wide range of
machines in use.  I would hate to build a system that second-guess
what users want to do with it.  I've come to be very suspcious of the

Ralf,

Tim suggested creating a table with the different platforms and
binaries. This will make it easier for the end user:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxDoyen

Bill created the table, and probably later this will become the
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomBinaries page.

If anybody wants to add a platform or a binary, please free to do so.

Regards,

Alfredo

I extend this to object code (architecture dependant binary format (to
be opposed to what is called bytecode)).

Just my thought.

Just in case anyone else is interested, the STIX font project
(comprehensive set of freely available math fonts) has released the
final form of their license: http://stixfonts.org/user_license.html and
is targeting beta availability of the fonts in December.  Very good
news.  I find the license a bit confusing at first glance but at least
it is progress!

Cheers,
CY

I am afraid that you have also just stated the reason why
embedded space in file names always cause problems for unix
based tools - because the developers give this a very low
priority. But it is a serious issue when porting to both
Windows and MAC where spaces in file names are common. At
very least we should try not to write code that we know is
not portable.

Speaking of your "list of things to do in buid-improvments":
Have you already or are you planning to publish this list?
Since build-improvements has become very important to the
future of Axiom (at least in my opinion), I think it would
be good to have such a list so that we can see just how
close or how far away completion of this branch is. It might
also help other people who are working on build-improvements
to more efficiently contribute to the progress.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I think one of the neat things about Axiom is that it is usually
not necessary or even desirable to make a distinction between
data structures and mathematical structures. Data structures are
just another kind of "mathematical" object.

For example, is an Axiom set, i.e. a member of the domain Set, a
data structure or a mathematical structure? Should we call the
domain Set a mathematical structure or only the category SetCategory
to which it belongs? And of course not everything that we would
like to call a set in Axiom is finite.

Essentially the only requirement of SetCategory is that the domain
has equality and inequality.

I think a Graph in Axiom has to be something nearly as fundamental
as a Set.

Well, at the moment Axiom can not be built under Cygwin because
GCL cannot be built under Cygwin. Maybe someday we will find
someone who wants to solve the problems of building GCL under
Cygwin...

On Windows GCL and Axiom (only AXIOMsys) are currently built under
MSYS/MinGW which provides a native Windows environment without
conversion. File name with spaces are suppored but some of the
unix-specific system commands on which Axiom depends (e.g. 'rm'
and 'cat'), another source of un-portability, have to be emulated
in such a way as to parse blanks in a non-standard way.

> And it is just easy to fix the environment.

I am not sure what you mean "fix the environment". Do you mean
target only linux-based systems for Axiom?

Ok.

I suppose, but I suspect that the codes would not have been
so obscured if the original code had not made unnecessary
assumptions about the character set from which file names are
composed.

That is not the case.  It fell out of the basic tools used.

Oh, don't believe that I don't see data structures as mathematical 
structures. They are. But I rather have the feeling that for efficiency 
reasons it is desirable to have some basic data structures underlying 
the mathematics where one can say something about the complexity of the 
functions. After all that is a distincion between classic mathematics 
and constructive mathematics.

Example. You want to implement quicksort. Would someone choose lists to 
do that instead of arrays? Both basically represent the mathematical 
idea of tuples. But we care about the actual representation on a 
computer. Why does Axiom have distributed and recursive polynomials. 
Mathematically it's the same thing, so why bother?

I hope you get somehow the feeling what I meant when I said that I care 
for data structures of graphs. We all know that some representation is 
better than the other for certain algorithms.

Drawing the line between "data structures" and "mathematical structures" 
is hard if not impossible. But for data structures I somehow feel that 
their documentation should clearly say something about the complexity of 
operations.

> For example, is an Axiom set, i.e. a member of the domain Set, a
> data structure or a mathematical structure?

How expensive is it to add a new element to an existing set of type 
Set(T) where T has no ordering function?
How expensive is it to add a new element to Set(T) if T provides an 
ordering function?

I actually don't care about much about whether to call it "data 
structure" or "mathematical structure" since in a general sense the 
first is (as an abstract data type) clearly a mathematical object.
What I care about is stating complexity properties and providing a rich 
set of basic data structures for Axiom/Aldor.

Actually, "Set" is a bad choice for the domain of finite sets that all
have the same type of elements. It should at least be called
"FiniteSet". But then, would make "Set" as a _domain_ in the sense of
mathematics be an interesting domain at all?

That is OK, I think.

As a category, I agree, but there is not *the* graph domain.

I played a little with this and reread aggcat which contains the
aggregate categories used in src/algebra. I displayed in Hyperdoc
Multiset and clicked on the example link (I wanted to know the "users"
of Multiset thanks to Waldek for its patch/remark), the interpreter
returned "Unknown page: MultisetXmpPage". This page seems to exist,
MSET.[p]ht contain some of what I think are examples.

Any idea why this page is not found ? Some other questions, is ph.awk
available somewhere, same thing for the sources of theses files, are
they available somewhere ? What is the difference between a .ht file and
a .pht file ?

A remark, my version of Axiom is not installed, it's just built, so
maybe this bug ("Unknown page: MultisetXmpPage") is specific to me. I
wanted to use the Debian version but encountered another bug ("string
something").

MSET.ht contains MultiSetXmpPage, which due to different capitalization
does not match MultisetXmpPage. =20

.pht was generated form .ht file.  It contains Axiom output, so that
Hypertex can show the output without recomputiong it.  I affraid that
we need to re-create ph.awk (maybe using another language).

Hey, Dave and Alex gave an invited talk at ISSAC almost two decades
ago :-)

     http://www.stepanovpapers.com/genprog.pdf

If you browse through the papers by Dave, Alex and collaborators
(especially, those in the early '80), you'll see that they noted
the potential of ScratchPad.  See, for example, the paper 
"Operators and Alegbraic Structures"

    http://www.stepanovpapers.com/p59-kapur.pdf

where they cite the paper by Jenks and Tragger.

Yes and No.  In many aspects, Axiom has painted itself into a corner
and insisting beyond reason on object-orientation, which clearly leads
to absurdities like having an Abelian monoid that is not a monoid,
or a ring that is just a monoid without being a group.  I don't think
any freshman in math would get its degree with those nonsense, but
Axiom seems to get away with it :-(  See past discussions on the topic.

You'll see many aspects of generic programming on Alex's site, in
particular in his class on generic programming he is giving at Adobe.

In our collaborative effort to design a "concept system" for C++, we
have tried very hard to ensure that we don't get into the same trap as
Axiom (but it is hard :-).  See for example, our paper "Specifying C++
concepts" 

      http://www.research.att.com/~bs/popl06.pdf

(where it in the related work, you'll see we have specifically mention
computer algebra as area of exploration, referring to Axiom), where we
insisted that we must resist class hierarchies (it has been tried many
times, and it fails). And further work

     http://www.research.att.com/~bs/oopsla06.pdf

There is a another aspect to Generic Programming, called "data-type
generic programming" in the functional programming community that put
less emphasis on algorithmic complexities and more on the structure
of datatype, abstracting over the concrete algebras and focusing on
the pattern functors and algorithms that could be defined solely in
terms of those.  We are working on connecting both views.

      http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/papers/dos_reis_et_al.pdf

Chase the citations to the datatype generic programming.

Hello,

I try to write a package for my own use from the manip.spad file
for expanding trigonometric functions.

The manip.spad has this definition.

smpExpand p == map (kerExpand, #1::F, p)

It's a map with THREE arguments. 

In Polynomial Domain there is only the usual map with TWO arguments.

I show it by )sh Polynomial Integer by exemple.

In my expand.spad I can't copy this line. 
I get an error when I compile.

If I add theses import thecompilation is fine :

    import FactoredFunctions(P)
    import PolynomialCategoryLifting(IndexedExponents K, K, R, P, F)
    import
      PolynomialCategoryQuotientFunctions(IndexedExponents K,K,R,P,F)


What are theses import command ?

Thanks a lot and have a good day !

Francois, in France.

use HyperDoc:

click Browse 

=> enter "map" (without quotes) 

=> click Operations 

=> click Parameters 

=> click map(f, g, x) (usually, f, g, h are functions, but don't rely on
                       this. you really need to check all 3 argument
                       forms. That's a shortcoming of HyperDoc, in fact.  Note
                       that #1::F is a shorthand for the function x +-> x::F)

there is only one such map, and it's in PolynomialCategoryLifting.



import PolynomialCategoryLifting(IndexedExponents K, K, R, P, F)

tells axiom to bring PolynomialCategoryLifting(IndexedExponents K, K, R, P, F)
into scope, so that you don't have to package call (using $) these functions
all the time.

Greetings!  Please excuse -- I am no longer receiving axiom developer
mail due to some spam blockage somewhere.  Have read on the web how
some have difficulty building axiom on ia64.

At present, there are 5 platforms in gcl-2.6.x (hppa, ia64, alpha,
mips, and mipsel) and 2 platforms on gcl-2.7.x (hppa and ia64) which
cannot natively relocate compiled object files.  This means that (load
"foo.o")(si::save-system "bar") will give garbage in bar (perhaps in
should simple be an error.  This is because loads happen via dlopen
and exist outside the heap.  Instead, images must be saved with
compiler::link.  Thus, there are some alternate commands which need
issuing in the axiom build to make this all work.  These are
summarized in the debian/patch.merge file in the debian axiom package.
With these commands, axiom builds on all 12 Debian platforms.


Here is patch.merge.  Note that one can conditionalize the alternate
procedures on #-native-reloc without having to keep track of specific
cpus.

If anyone would like to help getting bfd support for ia64 and friends,
please look at sfaslbfd_alpha.c and sfaslbfd_mips.c from the HEAD cvs
tree.  This should serve as an example for the needed sfaslbfd_ia64.c

Greetings!  GCL can be built without readline with
--disable-readline.  At runtime, readline can be turned on and off
with (si::readline-on) and (si::readline-off).  There is some support
for autocompletion.  readline should be automatically disabled when
the terminal is uncapable.  (si::readline-on in such circumstances
should reveal this.

GCL readline support should be reworked to avoid malloc if possible.

Take care,

Do you want to test how many people are active?

Thanks for the replies.

I am sorry to clutter the email list with this test. :-( In fact
it was sent by my email provider in response to my problem report
attached below. They claim that it is not their problem so perhaps
it has something to do with changes in the nongnu.org email list
software and the mx10.gnu.org server. Has anyone else received a
"fatal error" response like:

  550-Callback setup failed while verifying

?

Regards,
Bill Page.

We've had problems with mailing lists on other servers, and there's a 
thread on problems between gmail and sourceforge:

http://it.slashdot.org/it/06/10/04/1324214.shtml

sourceforge mailing lists were implementing "callbacks" and were 
dropping mail.

Here's a description of what might be happening:

http://atm.tut.fi/list-archive/nanog/msg37172.html

For what it's worth, I haven't seen problems with mail to 
axiom-developer on my end (knock on wood).

Hello,

I am having some issue with the eval function, any ideas ?
I have reduced my problem to the simplest form.
It is making me crazy !!!

Because UP, which is a PolynomialCat, has InnerEvalable

PolynomialCategory(R:Ring, E:OrderedAbelianMonoidSup, VarSet:OrderedSet):
        Category ==
  Join(PartialDifferentialRing VarSet, FiniteAbelianMonoidRing(R, E),
       Evalable %, InnerEvalable(VarSet, R),
       InnerEvalable(VarSet, %), RetractableTo VarSet,
       FullyLinearlyExplicitRingOver R)

What am I missing ?

Prog :

#include "axiom.as"

TestEval( x:Symbol , F:Field): with {}
== add {


    import from UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) ;
    import from Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) ;

    test(a:Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,F)):Fraction
UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) == {
        eval(a, x, 1)
    }

And here his the error message :

 aldor -M no-abbrev -O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom -Mno-AXL_W_WillObsolete
-DAxiom -Y $AXIOM/algebra eval.as
#1 (Warning) Deprecated message prefix: use `ALDOR_' instead of `_AXL'
"eval.as", line 11:                 eval(a, x, 1)
                    ................^
[L11 C17] #2 (Error) No one possible return type satisfies the context type.
  These possible return types were rejected:
          -- Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F))
  The context requires an expression of type
Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)).
The following could be suitable if imported:
  eval: (Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)), Symbol pretend SetCategory,
UnivariatePolynomial(x, F) pretend Type) -> Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x,
F)) from Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)), if UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)
has InnerEvalable(Symbol, UnivariatePolynomial(x, F))

Thanks

Antoine Hersen

Hi Antoine,

I don't know whether this is the right way to go, but at least it 
compiles and it might let you go further.

Suggestion:

Replace "eval(a, x, 1)" by

     z: SingletonAsOrderedSet := create();
     eval(numer a, z, 1)/eval(denom a, z, 1);

Maybe you can make that shorter. In particular the numer/denom part is 
perhaps too much, but that is what I have found to work, ehm compile.

Now, don't ask me how to relate x and z. The reason why I have 
introduced that z lies in the definition of UP. It is not defined as 
PolynomialCategory as such, but the code says...

UnivariatePolynomial(x:Symbol, R:Ring):
   UnivariatePolynomialCategory(R) with
   ...

and there you already see that in a category default, you have no chance 
of seeing the x.

But then it says...

UnivariatePolynomialCategory(R:Ring): Category ==
  Join(PolynomialCategory(R, NonNegativeInteger, SingletonAsOrderedSet),

which let me to define z as the only element of SingletonAsOrderedSet.

Maybe that helps a bit.

Ralf

I see that you skip database build when native-reloc does not hold.  Did
you try loading all domain files in interpreted mode?  AFAICS one gets
the same database and speed is also quite similar.

BTW.  To load domain files in interpreted mode I just removed .o files (there
is probably a better way).

Axiom actually has a very specific notion of what it means for
one mathematical structure to underly another - representation.
In Axiom domains have an associated internal representation, Rep.
The domain Rep is given in terms of domain constructors (such as
Record) applied to other previously defined domains. Then members
of the new domain % are mapped into Rep via the rep operator and
from Rep into % by the per operator. The exported operations of
% are defined in terms of the "underlying" operations in Rep.

We usual think of Rep as more "primitive" than % and as if Rep
is the underlying "data" structure and % is the mathematical
structure. But in general in Axiom this need to be the case.
There is indeed a most primitive domain which is not defined
in terms of any other, called simply Lisp. But it would not be
possible if the representation graph to contain loops so that
one can not say of any domain in the loop that it is more
primitive than another.

So using previously defined domains, and domain constructors
one builds a representation for the desired new domain and then
"encapsulates" it by exporting an interface to the essential
operations of this representation and hiding the non-essential
and irrelevant parts. And I think this might be applied in a
mutually recursive manner.

So is computational complexity a relative thing, i.e. we take
the operations from the representation as units and then express
the complexity of the operations of the new domain in terms of
these? Or is it an absolute thing that must be expressed in
terms of the most primitive domain (Lisp) or even deeper in
terms of a given hardware architecture?

I am not sure that I would agree that this is the right distinction.
Ultimately in computer algebra systems I think all mathematics must
be constructive. In a sense, that is what we mean by "algebra". An
existence proof or a proof by contradiction is not of much use in
such a system.

In Axiom this is not really an appropriate question. quicksort
would be implemented in a generic manner so that it can be applied
to any domain that provides the necessary methods. In fact in the
Axiom book contains exactly this example (bubble sort actually).

> Both basically represent the mathematical idea of tuples.

No, I don't think so. As mathematical objects lists, arrays and
tuples are all quite distinct however I agree that they all provide
the necessary methods on which sort may operate.

Agreed.

This may not be such a good example since I think the difference
here is primarily related to how these domains coerce to OutputForm.
It is not clear to me how or when we can say that something is
"mathematically the same thing".

Yes that is true and I agree that it is an important issue.

The current Axiom library does make such a distinction at least
conceptually. See for example the Algebra and Data structure
hierachies in the end covers of the Axiom book. However note that
at least SetCategory, Finite, and OrderedSet appear in both
diagrams.

All domains that have SetCategory are required to have a hash into
SmallInteger. I suppose that this means that the cost of adding
new elements is independent of Type T.

I don't agree. Finite is yet another category.

Why not? As a domain, Set need not be finite.

(1) -> Integer has SetCategory

   (1)  true
                                                 Type: Boolean

(2) -> ZMOD 7 has SetCategory

   (2)  true
                                                 Type: Boolean

(3) -> Set Integer has Finite

   (3)  false
                                                 Type: Boolean

(4) -> Set ZMOD 7 has Finite

   (4)  true
                                                 Type: Boolean

(5) -> size()$Set ZMOD 7

   (5)  128
                                       Type: NonNegativeInteger

Note that size:()->NNI, i.e. the size of the Domain, is different
then #:%->NNI, or cardinality of the size of a given set. It is
true that all members of Set have a finite cardinality. But not
all domains in SetCategory are Finite.

Similar to Set, I think we need to admit the possibility of an
infinite number of members of the Graph domain, i.e. Graph need
not have Finite.

As a category I think I would want GraphCategory to require at
least

  Node: SetCategory
  Edge: SetCategory
  Source: Edge -> Node
  Target: Edge -> Node

But I do not want to require that all domains in GraphCategory
are Finite. Just as all domains in SetCategory are not Finite.

I think it is interesting that multisets only have cardinality if
the domain has finiteAggregate since count is unbounded.

It seems that there is a realistic prospect of making hyperdoc
more useful and more reliable. Is there enough interest to warrant
establishing a new branch focusing on hyperdoc-improvements?

There are awk scripts like ht.awk that sound similar to this in
the htex directory that is part of the original Axiom source
distribution (not currently in the Open Source version but could
be if we want them, I think). Where can I find a reference to
ph.awk?

I believe that Kai Kaminski worked on some code (in Perl?) to
extract the executable parts of the .ht files as .input files
and then run Axiom to re-generate the Axiom output sections.
I don't know if this work was completed or not. In principle
it is not difficult. Some parts of this would be similar to
what is done on the Axiom wiki to product wiki pages with
embedded Axiom output (using Python).

Bill Page.

The notion of sorting is defined terms of order and permutation.

Great. Thanks for the reference. Sun seems to be a big user
of Mercurial. It is also used in the OpenSolaris project.
Let me know how it goes with build-improvements and hg.

You might be interested in the draft of a book on Mercurial:

I believe that all messages that I received recently from Ralf are
here in the axiom-developer email archive:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/index.html

which means that under normal circumstances these would also have
been forwarded to you. Are you missing some?

>=20

hash makes testing equality O(1).

Axiom's implementation of Set is rather primitive.

See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/SetsSpad

Set(S:SetCategory): FiniteSetAggregate S

...
++ \spad{insert(x,t)} and \spad{remove(x,t)} is \spad{O(n)}
...
      insert_!(x, s) =3D=3D
        for k in minIndex s .. maxIndex s repeat
          s.k =3D x =3D> return s
        insert_!(x, s, inc maxIndex s)
...

Bill Page.

Dear Antoine,

great to see you here!

I also had problems with that. In general, I think it is better to avoid UP
whenever possible and use SUP instead.

For your problem, one workaround is to use elt instead:

     test(a:Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,F)):Fraction
 UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) == elt(a, 1)

(Note that 1 refers to a Fraction UP here...)



I can only guess why 

 eval : (%,Symbol,UnivariatePolynomial(x,Integer)) -> %

does not work: it seems that it is not implemented. "Fraction" takes it from
"QuotientFieldCategory", which exports it unconditionally:

QuotientFieldCategory(S: IntegralDomain): Category ==
  Join(Field, Algebra S, RetractableTo S, FullyEvalableOver S,
         DifferentialExtension S, FullyLinearlyExplicitRingOver S,
           Patternable S, FullyPatternMatchable S)

However, "QuotientFieldCategory" doesn't provide a default definition... I
guess this should be reported on issueTracker. Currently I don't have the time
to check this more thoroughly, it would be interesting to see whether the
compiler issues a warning when compiling "Fraction".


In any case, the fix is probably very easy, since QuotientFieldCategory has
numer and denom. However, we should to check which definitions of "eval" should
be provided. There are so many defaults...

I consider starting a new branch.  I feel that Axiom needs a period
of faster developement, in particular removing and/or cleaning old
code.

General directions:
-- generate all information that can be generated (documentation,
   images, databases)
-- remove unused code (both old and new but unfinished)
-- rework file handling (current code is buggy, complicated and
   inefficient)
-- improve SPAD compiler

My goals partially overlap with goals of build-improvements, but
I reached a point where I need deeper changes (including compiler)
to support better build.  Also, unused/needlessy complicated code
makes changes and understanding harder, so I think that cleanups
and removals should be done quickly -- accepting risks of 
temporary breakage.

I agree.

There are at least two other possible branches that we should
consider:

  - documentation improvements branch (Ralf?)
  - hyperdoc improvements branch

However for each such branch I think we need someone to take
primary responsibility. Is there anyone sufficiently strongly
motivated to take on the task of hyperdoc improvements?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I do hope there is no duplicate effort there.  Yesterday, I was
considerig gdr-sandbox from build-improvements, but maybe we should
just work on compiler-improvements branch and deal with the merges?

As for the databse, I have strong feeling that we should not
underestimate the work done by the dynamic libraries community.

I would take responsibility in the documentation improvements, but I 
will not start immediately. Anyway, I indend to introduce just a new 
directory and leave all .pamphlet files untouched in the first approach.
This way it is probably easier to integrate documentation improvements 
into both silver and build-improvements.

I actually would feel better if build-improvements is finished first and 
becomes silver, before I start branching from one of them.
Tim, Gaby, when do you expect the build-improvements branch to be merged 
back to silver?

All responsibility for silver/gold/release is now a community effort.
It's up to everyone to decide what, when, and how things should happen.
I'm working on several subtasks that are not yet ready for release
so I have no changes to promote.

No, there is a lot more to the mathematics of set than that. It
would mean that all sets are finite and that is quite far from
the case. Rather, sets should be strongly related to types.

I think the "constructive mathematics" that is most suitable
to Axiom is probably is probably Intuitionist type theory
(Martin-L=F6f). See:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_type_theory

"A logical framework, such as Martin-L=F6f's takes the form of
closure conditions on the context dependent sets of types and
terms: that there should be a type called Set, and for each set
a type, that the types should be closed under forms of dependent
sum and product, and so forth."

In Axiom types are implemented as domains or categories. So this
means that for examle the set

  {1,2,3}

should not be considered as just member of the domain Set, but
rather it should denote a *domain* which has as members the
Integers 1, 2 and 3 in other words a sub-domain of Integer (or
PositiveInteger, NNI, etc.). And Integer itself can be viewed
as a set.

As a domain constructor Set(T) is best viewed as a "powerset"
type, i.e. the type associated with all subsets of a given type
T.

Axiom (SPAD) does have a "subdomain" construction which is used
for example to define NonNegativeInteger and PositiveInteger
from the type Integer. This is one of the less developed ideas
in Axiom but I think this is exactly the place where computer
algebra meets proof theory and is therefore ripe for further
development.

Regards,
Bill Page.

My curent plan for the compiler is as follows: parse all the algebra
files and invoke a new mini-compiler on the result. In the first stage
this new compiler should just collect declarations and emit 
databases.  Besides direct benefits this is intened to verify my
understandig of abstract syntax and typechecking of SPAD. In the
next stages the new compiler should act as a pre-pass for current
SPAD compiler, incrementally taking more and more responsibilities.

However, I think that before making such changes I need preparations
(cleanups, helper variables and routines ...).  Here I would like
to go fast forward -- the whole thing is experimental and if 
something fails it is better if it fails quickly.  

Concerning compiler-improvements branch: If you think about merging
changes for private branches I would think that first we need some
real working code to merge.

Could you elaborate: I feel that I have adequate understanding
of dynamic code generation and linking but maybe I am missing
something?

I think I tracked down the problem. In build-improvements, on the Mac, 
the configure for gcl was being called with a broken --enable-machine 
flag, and the subsequent make would fail.

I think this patch to configure.ac.pamphlet fixes it.

I also incorporated other suggested changes to the configure flags:

1) we should use locbfd instead of custreloc

2) we don't need X Window system support or xgcl

With these changes a full build of noweb, gcl and axiom work on my 
PowerPC Mac OS X 10.4.8 machine with the following steps:

# remove fink /sw/bin from the path
PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin
./configure --without-noweb --without-gcl
make

This is great!  We should disable xgcl for all of the targets.
Could your update your patch accordingly and commit?
I can do it but not now (unfortunately).

If I restrict me to Spad since I do not really use Aldor (it's not free) =
even
if the compiler has a notion of Rep it's just a "conventional" notation. =
If you
play with an element of type Rep you "package call" function. Of course i=
f the
compiler know its type it's not necessary. You can hide this representati=
on,
see for example the Integer domain but you can have more than one represe=
ntation
too. My experimentation on this:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/LispsFractionIntegerDomain

This is an experimentation, in particular I played in what I call the "da=
rk side".
I do not like this experimentation, in the Axiom world (more below).

I do not totally agree. Yes it's good to implement default algorithm in
categories but each domain has the possibility to provide its own
implementation and this is a good thing. Do you want, for the
exponentiation of Integers, to use the repeatedSquaring algorithm coded
in Spad ? For me it's an important question.=20

I totally disagree :-) This is a good example. I forgot where and
if this is the example used in the Axiom book but the authors insisted
on this point. I do not think this is related only to the coercion to Out=
putForm.
Just an example, if you want to implement sparse matrix you'll inherit op=
eration
from MatrixCategory, but you'll have to provide your own implementation t=
o
access each element (the *elt* family). After that it'll be possible to u=
se
the matrix multiplication algorithm implemented in MatrixCategory. The
representation problem is for me is important. I'm not a specialist of th=
e
Polynomial domains/categories in Axiom (which are, I think, the most deve=
loped
areas in Axiom) so I can not argue about this, but some
algorithms depends intimately on the internal representation used.

Yes :-) But even for the question of implementing generic things. You hav=
e
to choose a category or create a new one. You can use a general category =
but
you can choose a more specialised category expressively defined (definiti=
on in the usual
sense for example in the documentation) to handle efficiently what you ar=
e
trying to do. I'm not a fan of performance and, in another mail, I said t=
hat
Axiom need to be able to compile to object code. I'm not against compilin=
g to
bytecode, but sometimes it's necessary to have optimised code.

I'm, when I say that, in the "dark side" of Axiom. A lot of
algorithm (I do not speak about Polynomials) in Axiom are extremely gener=
al
and I love that but... some of them from my point of view need to be spec=
ialised
in the sense that another implementation need to be added in the domains
(this is the "dark side").

It seems to me that the authors of Axiom were sometimes too general proba=
bly
by lack of time but sometimes I'm asking if in fact, no, "they did not wa=
nt to
specialise the code" they wanted to have the more general algorithm possi=
ble
(which is necesssary too :-)).

It's a pity that, for example, Manuel Bronstein did not
implement modular algorithm for computation of determinant of matrices
(since I know it worked on this) or any other specialised thing.
I have some difficulties to express what I think, this is somewhat
a philosophical question :-) :  do we want sometimes to restrict the gene=
rality of an
operation (and restrict the user to use what we think it has to use) ?
For example quickSort is implemented for FiniteLinearAggregate and I'm
happy with that, but do you want to apply this operation on a big list ?

Hmm... I'm pretty sure you'll not understand me...

Greg

PS: the Lisp's fraction integer specialisation is not a good example of w=
hat I think !!!
(it opens some questions on the architecture of Axiom though).
PS2: I love how Axiom and Mupad (it's no longer free :-() are, conceptual=
ly, implemented.

You applied change in version 259 only to Makefile.in (Makefile.pamphlet
stayed unchanged).

That would be great. If we have that we can really start cleaning up the 
algebra code.

It seems that with the speed of Axiom, SPAD is soon becoming the better 
Aldor. AFAIK, there is no move in opening Aldor.

I thought I was stating something obvious. Are you asking why I
think all sets would be finite if the only operation you require
to form sets is the ability to "build an element"? Ok, maybe there
is also induction so that for example we could define the set of
positive integers (natural numbers) as consisting of the element 1
and the operation +1 that "builds a new element". So depending on
what else you assume about the "environment", I would have to
withdraw my claim of finiteness. But considering complexity issues
in constructing these numbers we would be better off with at least
one more element forming operation - doubling - leading to binary
representation.

However it is not clear to me that there always exists the
possibility to define a set by it's elements. For example is this
possible if we wish to define the set of exact real numbers such
as suggested by your reference below?

When it comes to the concept of exact real numbers I think you
are absolutely right but is not clear to me why you would prefer
this text in the context of set theory and Axiom. Can you explain?

Exact reals for Axiom is a subject that we have previously
discussed on this list. See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/RealNumbers

Here is a recent article on this subject.

Think of implementing Buchberger's algorithm for multivariate 
commutative polynomial rings. In order to test whether one polynomial is 
reducible with respect to another, one has to access the exponent vector 
of the leading term. In a distributed format with keeping the terms 
sorted LT(p) would be a O(1) operation. I cannot think of something of 
that complexity for recursive polynomials if the term order is chosen to 
be "degree reverse lexicographical".

My number one wish for improving the *SPAD* compiler is:

   Better compiler error messages!

For me, this is the number one reason for strongly prefering Aldor.
In fact without starting in Aldor first, I still find it very
difficult to write fluently in SPAD.

The number two reason only being language features such as fully
supported dependent types and extend.

>=20

If by "Spad algebra over the compiler" you mean: implementing the
interpreter in SPAD rather than Boot and Lisp, then I think this
was clearly the original intention of (at least some of) the Axiom
developers. Boot is really a kind of pre-SPAD.

Finally "better support for generic programming" sounds a little
frightening to me, but I can't think of anyone better suited to
do this than you, Gaby. :-)

Bill Page.

I remember I said that "Set" is somehow a bad name for a domain in Axiom 
that only implements "(the collection of) finite sets of elements of a 
given type T".

Or (from sets.spad):

++ A set over a domain D models the usual mathematical notion of a
++ finite set of elements from D.

Although

i: Integer

and

s: FinitePowerSet T

would be in perfect analogy if one read ":" as "element of", then to go 
on "l: List T" would mean "List" is the container of all finite 
sequences (with some information about their representation (linked 
list)). It's soon getting confusing. So I would rather choose 
"FiniteSet". But then (except proper classes) everything is a set. Why 
would one need a domain of sets? "SetCategory" is more important.

And in Axiom it is an approximation anyway, since it is Set(T), ie a 
collection of things of a common type T. The name "Set" is probably an 
exception one could accept.

Do the versions for mips and alpha work? Tested?
What is the relation of HEAD to 2.6.8pre?
I have taken a brief look at this and am considering taking it on.

Hello,

I get nasty FOAM run time error with Ralf solution( I used it in a
more involved context)

And I cant compile Martin one, maybe I should not assume that a Field
is an INTDOM ...

I presume that you are aware of the following page on the Axiom
Wiki?

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/TeXmacs

If you installed Axiom-0.1.4 after WinTeXmacs (and therefore the
Axiom programs appear before any other in the PATH) then you should
be using a modified version of tm_axiom distributed with Axiom (see
info on above web page). In that case, setting the following options
at the top of your TeXmacs document might help:

  )set output texmacs over no
  )set output texmacs space yes

You can also set these are default by creating an environment
variable

  TM_AXIOM=3D'over no, space yes'

If you have problems with the Axiom verison of tm_axiom then you
can also report them here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/IssueTracker

or on the Axiomm Developer list

  axiom-developer@nongnu.org

BTW: Welcome to Axiom. :-) We are actively looking for people to do
Axiom development on Windows. Please drop in if you are interested.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I don't think Bishop is dealing with exact realy numbers, as opposed
to constructive mathametics -- with analysis as an example.
I don't believe Axiom has a clear constructive notion of set theory,
so I'm not preferring anything.  I'm just ignoring what Axiom does :-)

However, the existence of 1.. in Axiom would suggest that actually

Yes.  Essentially once this code can load a few .o files, it can load
any of them.  The self build of gclcvs on the Debian autobuilders
works the code heavily.

HEAD is 2.7.0, the active development version, where new features are
added and ansi compliance is approached.  When ready, we will release
it as 2.8.0, following the Linux kernel numbering scheme.  2.6.x is
the stable branch, critical bug fix only (more or less), for maxima,
acl2, axiom, hol88 and nqthm support.

This would be most appreciated, and I'd be happy to lend assistance.
Knowledge of the ia64 reloc definitions is obviously key, though I put
together the alpha version mostly as a guesswork based on the mips
example.  If ia64 were done, we could also share with the lush
project, on which the original sfaslbfd_mips was inspired.  And
someday it would be great to get this back into bfd upstream.

The basic idea is that each section of the .o file has a got table
appended to handle the relocs that refer to the special gp register
value.

Take care,

What a great idea -- no I have not tried this, hoping instead to get

It might be possible to rebind si::*load-types* at the right moment.

I don't understand why Ralf introduces a new variable z. But
I think that is the right idea.

According to Axiom:

  )display op eval

There is only one possible 3-argument form of eval that could
apply

   [26] (D,D1,D2) -> D from D
            if D has IEVALAB(D1,D2) and D1 has SETCAT and D2 has TYPE

Thus

    if Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x, F) has InnerEvalable(Symbol,
Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,F)) then {
      test3(a:Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,F)):Fraction
UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) =3D=3D {
        eval(a, x, 1)
      }
    }

compiles but will not work as one might expect because the
condition is false for Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)

However

  UnivariatePolynomial(x, F) has
InnerEvalable(UnivariatePolynomial(x,F),
  UnivariatePolynomial(x,F))

is true so one way that does work is:

    import from UnivariatePolynomial(x, F);
    import from NonNegativeInteger;

    test1(a:Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,F)):Fraction
UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) =3D=3D {
        eval(numer a, monomial(1$F,1),1)/eval(denom a,
monomial(1$F,1),1)
    };

    -- equivalently
    test(n:UnivariatePolynomial(x,F)):UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) =3D=3D
eval(n,monomial(1$F,1),1);
    test2(a:Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,F)):Fraction
UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) =3D=3D {
        map(test, a)
    };

monomial(1$F,1) is just one way to get x in the right form.
(Perhaps Ralf missed this possibility.)

See for example:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBox7#msg20061114232755-0600@wiki.axi
om-developer.org

No it not necessary to assume that a Field is an INTDOM.

I also don't understand Martin's workaround since Fraction does
not export elt with this signature.

However I agree with him that QuotientFieldCategory should probably
provide a default implementation of eval such as I show above and
as it does now for map.

Gaby,

Are you willing to give Waldek the "go ahead" to commit the
following patch?

I think this is very important because these naming problems
still prevent svn from being used on both Windows and MAC.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I just synced my tree with SVN and it says that Makefile.pamphlet was

Same thing.  The online archive seems to agree:

In case anyone is wondering what Gaby is talking about, I think the
following paper by Dos Reis and Jarvi:

  What is Generic Programming?
  Library-Centric Software Design LCSD'05

http://lcsd05.cs.tamu.edu/papers/dos_reis_et_al.pdf

provides a good introduction. It defines a List as the least fixed
point of

      X |-> 1 + T x X

Hopefully a future paper will deal more specifically with Axiom. :-)

In Axiom List could be defined something like this

  List(T:Type):ListAggregate =3D=3D add
    Rep =3D=3D Union(nil,Record(first:T,rest:%))
    ...

(perhaps it is in Aldor?) but in fact the actual definition refers
directly to the underlying Lisp architecture.

There is also a recent paper by Pablo Nogueira
http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pni

  When is an Abstract Data Type a Functor? (31 Oct 06)
  7th Symposium on Trends in Functional Programming (TFP'06)

http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pni/Papers/adt-functors.pdf

It contains a lot of references to Haskell and some category theory
but most of what it says about ADTs can also be applied to Axiom.

See also

http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pni/Papers/index.html

>=20

I don't think so.

In Axiom 1.. is called a UniversalSegment or a "Segment which may
be half open". Open segments can be expanded as Streams.

(1) -> expand(1..)

   (1)  [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...]
                                             Type: Stream Integer

Formally Streams are defined as the greatest fixed point of the
functor

   X |-> T x X

Streams are like Lists but can be infinite. Axiom has both lists and
streams. E.g.

(2) -> generate(x+->nextItem(x),0)$Stream(INT)

   (2)  [0,1,- 1,2,- 2,3,- 3,4,- 4,5,...]
                                             Type: Stream Integer

I had no need to define List this way, but what about binary trees?
The following code snipped is from Aldor-Combinat and it is running code.

---BEGIN test/species.as.nw
[snip]

testRecursive1(): () == {
         macro {
                 I == EmptySetSpecies;
                 X == SingletonSpecies;
                 + == Plus;
                 * == Times;
         }

         A(L: LabelType): CombinatorialSpecies L == (I + X*A*A)(L) add;

         import from Integer, Array Integer;
         checkExpOrd(
             A,
             [1, 1, 4, 30, 336, 5040],
             [1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42]
         );
}

[snap]
---END test/species.as.nw

If you want List the line should be simply ...

   MyList(L: LabelType): CombinatorialSpecies L == (I + X*MyList)(L) add;

Well, but in LibAldor List is not defined as a real Union. It rather 
relies on the fact that an actual record can never be the nil pointer.

Oh, by the way, the above recursive definition of binary trees not only 
defines the data structure but also the exponential and ordinary 
generating series. So one could ask how many trees are there with 7 
nodes (labelled or unlabelled). I fact, it should also be possible, to 
generate all these trees.

Recently, Martin Rubey has done some work to make Aldor-combinat 
available for Axiom, but for the underlying compilation we still need 
the Aldor compiler. So, Gaby, I consider Aldor-combinat a testcase for 
the compiler-improvements branch. ;-)

By the way, in aldor-combinat (or axiom-combinat, if you like), you can define
an equivalent to "List L" as


macro {
        I == EmptySetSpecies;
        X == SingletonSpecies;
        + == Plus;
        * == Times;
}

List(L: LabelType): CombinatorialSpecies L == (I + X*List)(L) add;

That's all. All the logic is hidden in CombinatorialSpecies, Plus and
Times. Well, not quite, but to see what's missing (and how to easily add it)
you'll have to read the docs.

It's Ralf who made this possible, I'd like to add.

Yes it is. With and without labels.

And the prettiest thing of all is that it should be quite easy to add code that
gives those recursively generated domains more structure. For example, one
would maybe like to construct a specific binary tree, or take two and add them
together and so on.

Yes, that was a local problem (probably due to NFS) -- I see correct

I waited for:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00294.html

I tested file renaming from

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00297.html

only with patch 2006-11/msg00294 which removes second copy of 'util.ht'.
I think that renaming from 2006-11/msg00297 should work even without
2006-11/msg00294 applied, but I did not test that combination.  Also
I having the to compies of 'util.ht' out of sync _may_ cause troubles
(I was hit by this).

But it is true.

Field(): Category == Join(EuclideanDomain,UniqueFactorizationDomain,
   DivisionRing) with ...
EuclideanDomain(): Category == PrincipalIdealDomain with ...
PrincipalIdealDomain(): Category == GcdDomain with ...
GcdDomain(): Category == IntegralDomain with ...

But ...

UnivariatePolynomial(x:Symbol, R:Ring):
   UnivariatePolynomialCategory(R) with ...

UnivariatePolynomialCategory(R:Ring): Category ==
     ...
     if R has IntegralDomain then
         Eltable(Fraction %, Fraction %)
         elt  : (Fraction %, Fraction %) -> Fraction %
              ++ elt(a,b) evaluates the fraction of univariate 
polynomials \spad{a}
              ++ with the distinguished variable replaced by b.

So Martin's suggestion does not sound so wrong to me.

Since I worked backwards to find where "eval" is implemented. That 
compiled and I was in a rush. I don't claim it is the way to go.

I hope you see that the eval from above is not the same function as the 
eval here.

I considered the definitions ...

UnivariatePolynomial(x:Symbol, R:Ring):
   UnivariatePolynomialCategory(R) with ...

UnivariatePolynomialCategory(R:Ring): Category ==
  Join(PolynomialCategory(R, NonNegativeInteger, SingletonAsOrderedSet),
       Eltable(R, R), Eltable(%, %), DifferentialRing,
       DifferentialExtension R) with ...

PolynomialCategory(R:Ring, E:OrderedAbelianMonoidSup, VarSet:OrderedSet):
         Category ==
   Join(PartialDifferentialRing VarSet, FiniteAbelianMonoidRing(R, E),
        Evalable %, InnerEvalable(VarSet, R),
        InnerEvalable(VarSet, %), RetractableTo VarSet,
        FullyLinearlyExplicitRingOver R) with

while I am using InnerEvalable(VarSet, R) (which has nothing to do with 
the symbol x from UnivariatePolynomial, you suggested

InnerEvalable(%, %)

from UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) where I must say, that I would have to 
dig deeper in the category hierarchy of UP in order to find that signature.

Two different "eval"s, where yours is probably a bit more general. I 
don't believe that they end up in the same implementation.

I'm slowly going crazy. gcl builds without problems, but not from the 
axiom build-improvements makefiles if I configure axiom --without-gcl. A 
gcl is built and installed into build/{ARCH}, but it segfaults as soon 
as it starts.

A build from the lsp directory seems to work, but not from the toplevel. 
It produces a working gcl in build/{ARCH}/bin/gcl.

I suspect a problem with the ENV= definition in the top-level Makefile, 
but haven't been able to track it down. Are we supposed to define 
GCLDIR? It currently isn't being defined, and an empty GCLDIR is being 
passed on to make in the lsp directory

A make distclean in the toplevel leaves the broken gcl in the lsp 
directory, so I'm deleting the whole source tree between every build.

You are right. I was not clear. I meant it is not necessary to
assume it *as an additional assumption* since it is true by
Axiom's definition of Field. But it is irrelevant to this problem.

>=20

Yes. However as I said, Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,F) does
not export elt so the workaround cannot work as it was written.

I tried writing:

  test(a:Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)):Fraction
UnivariatePolynomial(x, F) =3D=3D
    elt(a,1$Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x,
F)))$UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)

but Aldor continues to insist that there is no such elt that
returns Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x, F). Perhaps it is a
compiler bug?

In any case, isn't it strange that UnivariatePolynomialCategory
should be Eltable(Fraction %, Fraction %)? What is Fraction doing
in that definition of UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)?

Note the presence of

eval : (%,UnivariatePolynomial(x,Fraction
Integer),UnivariatePolynomial(x,Fraction Integer)) -> %

in the example below. This is the eval that I used in my version.

(1) -> F:=3DFRAC INT

   (1)  Fraction Integer
                                                     Type: Domain

(2) -> F has Field

   (2)  true
                                                     Type: Boolean

(3) -> F has IntegralDomain

   (3)  true
                                                     Type: Boolean

(4) -> UP(x,FRAC INT) has Eltable(FRAC UP(x,FRAC INT),FRAC UP(x,FRAC
INT))

   (4)  true
                                                     Type: Boolean

I agree with the sentiment of not rmoving gloss.text.

Please include explanation in pamphlets so as not to delay patch
review.  

| I tested file renaming from
| 
| http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00297.html
| 
| only with patch 2006-11/msg00294 which removes second copy of 'util.ht'.

| 2006-11/msg00294 applied, but I did not test that combination.  Also
| I having the to compies of 'util.ht' out of sync _may_ cause troubles
| (I was hit by this).

Please let separate the patches:
  (1) one for renaming -- contains explanations
  (2) one for deletiing the redundant file -- also must contain
      explanation of why.

The definition you gave is it: least fixed point of

The interesting bit about those inductive definition is that they come

Do you mean that I should test and apply renaming patch without
removing 'util.ht'?  I really do not like this -- that would mean
patching both copies or leaving a potential bug.

So you want something like:

: We messed up.  We hade the rule:
: 
: <old rule>
:
: We should not try to install two source files into single location,
: so we removed the rule.

I find such "explanation" silly: we have version control and change
logs to keep history.  And does not explain anything about the system
_after_ the fix is applied.

I must say here that I want a private branch for experiments precisely
to avoid fuss about trivial details.  For experimental work that
would be deadly.  And even on "release" branch I think you go too
far.

Not because you can come up with a silly explanation means that any
explanation should be silly.  Please, let's keep things in perspective.

What about:

   There are two files for each (special) character glyph, one
   for the upper case form, and one for the lower case form.
   Historically, the names for these files used to differ only in the 
   first character (which is upper case for the upper case form).
   That was non-portable and caused griefs on brain damaged file
   systems that identify themselves as ``case preserving, case insensitive''
   where alpha.ps and Alpha.ps ended up designating the same file.
   Consequently, the files for the upper case form have been renamed
   to xxx-cap.ps, where "xxx" used to be the historic name.

?

Please feel free to elaborate/improve it.


I'm of the opinion that you get should in the habit of including
explanation in the pamphlets when you submit them for consideration.
I would like to see the changes explained.  One reason, in this
particular case, is that when it comes to merge build-improvements
back to trunk (whatever it is called) there will be differences and
conflicts, and I would hate to have to spend hours in front of a
browser digging in the archive.  Yes, we have ChangeLog files, but
they are no substitute for documentation files (which are the pamphlets).

You're making invaluable contributions to Axiom; let's make sure we
don't end up in the same trap as current system.  Thanks!

I am sympathetic to Waldek's complaint - not because I think
explanations are silly but rather because I know how annoying
it is to write such explanations after the solution is complete
and when your mind is ready to focus on the next issue.

My experience (on other projects) is that it is much better,
whenever possible to work as a two person team. One person is
"lead" and other can be mostly "audience" or "apprentice". The
presence of the 2nd person is the motivation for providing an
explanation. That is why it is so easy to write such explanation
in the form of email. But we can also assign the responsibility
of writing documentation based on the explanations to the 2nd
person. Also they can ask important questions when the explanation
is not clear.  It can be their main contribution to the work.=20

My suggestiong is that when we start to work on a patch, we first
ask on the axiom-developer list for someone to play the role of
2nd person. Perhaps this is a way for people who do not yet feel
bold enough to work on Axiom themselves yet to get started.

Yes, I would agree to act as the 2nd person and write such
documentation from time to time. :-)

Here Gaby has done a excellent job as 2nd person. If I were Waldek
I would just take this and add it to the pamphlet file. :-)

I think we can work together to make sure that does not happen.

Gaby, we are miscomunicating here.  I wrote about 2006-11/msg00294
for which _really_ I that best explantion is "remove reference to
redundant file" (and ChangeLog is _the_ place to put it).

Expanation you wrote is about 2006-11/msg00297 (you wrote that it
contains explanation, but in fact explanantion is in the text
outside the patch). Again ChangeLog is logical place to put
it.  If you insist on some info outside ChangeLog i would 
propose to create a new pamplets called "Coding guide" (or
maybe into DeveloperNotes).

Well:
1) AFAIU the whole SCM discussion started because we wanted chageset
   support.  ChangeLog entry is part of a chageset and would be the
   first place I would look at during merge.
2) I you are concerned that ChangeLog is not a pamphlet we can easily
   correct this: write a few Latex macros, header and footer. Then
   a little script can easily convert format (bidirectionally if
   for some reason we also want conventional ChangeLog).

I think we have conflicting paradigms here.  I belive that history
has place in documentation only if it explains _significant_ aspect
of current system.  In case of current filename change past status
really tells you nothing about new system.

The comment I wrote is effectively for justifying the renaming patch,
which is I thought you're objecting to on the ground that we can find
an explanation that does not look good.  Is that wrong?


For 2006-11/msg00294 I still believe that we need explanation saying
why we removed the redundant file.  This explanation is better placed
in the Makefile pamphlet than the ChangeLog.  Say something like 

  The Axiom system from which this branch had been made appears 
  to contain a redundant copy of util.ht. The version in x/y/z has
  been removed so as to minimize blah.

That needs to go in the Makefile, not the ChangeLog.  When we come to
merge, they will be very helpful -- my experience with GCC branches
makes me very skeptikal of changes on branches that are only (briefly)
described in ChangeLogs.  The patch is approved with that caveat.

When the merge is done, some of the comments will become obselete, but
not before.  When it comes to merge and someone question removal, it
would be much better to point them at the documentation why it
happened.  We would not want to start yet another discussion on
literate programming when we will be busy trying to merge and have a
wonderful system.

yes, but a ChangeLog is not a substitute for documentation.  It helps
track changes; it does not explain why changes have been made.  My
whole point is that, yes, we record a change with brief description
(ChangeLog), but we need to explain *why* we made the change.  That
will prove helpful to ourselves when we will face skepticals.

I don't think ChangeLog should be a pamphlet.  Its purpose is to
contain brief description of changes, to assist in archeology.

I'm not so sure.

The trouble is how to define "significant".  Some people think that if
something changes Axiom to do better error message, it is
significant.  And I agree.  Others think that if it changes any code
in a software that is alredy undocumented, then it is significant
too.  I tend to agree.

Except that this is a *branch* we are going to merge back to trunk.  We
need to know why we did a change.

Hello Humberto,

  How about this patch I'm testing?  I splitted the GCLOPTS into
independent parts, and disabled X and TK for all targets.

The main difference between boottran::boottocl and boottran::boottoclc
is that the latter includes the Boot codes (as comment) in
translation.

Well, that is the theory.

In practice, they happen to translate very subtly in different ways.
I think the reason for that is bug instead of design.

boottran::boottocl translates Boot code while in the scope of the 
package boottran.  boottran::boottoclc does not.  Consequently, 
boottoclc would translate (Boot) "not" to (Lisp) "|not|", when in fact
it should have translated to (Lisp) "NOT".

One possible fix is to have boottoclc push into package boottran
before doing the translation.  This would have to be done for all
callers of boottocllines.  That is not good.  So, I'm considering
fixing boottocllines instead.

If you know more about this, please let me know.

Hello,

I test my own expand function in its package UsualExpand.
The code is in ~/Axiom/expand.spad file.

I can compile this function without problem.
)cd 
)cd Axiom
)co expand.spad

When I run a new axiom session I use this function by :

)cd                    -- go to the home diectory
)cd Axiom
)library USEXPAND
expand (cos (2*x))$UsualExpand(Integer,Expression Integer)
gives me cos x^2 - sin x^2.

Then I want to remplace in this axiom session the old expand in 
TranscendentalManipulations(Integer, Expression Integer) by this expand.

So I test :
)cd 
)cd Axiom
)set expose drop constructor TranscendentalManipulations
)library USEXPAND
)set expose add constructor UsualExpand

But expand (cos (2*x)) uses the original expand, not the new expand.

What must I correct in this code ?

Can I use a parameter on the command line in order to set path and 
initialisation of axiom ?

There are some *.input files for testing axiom in the main axiom Makefile.
How can I rerun them and compare the results between the native expand
command and mine ?

Have a good day !

Francois

The following patch makes caching of databases effective and
reduces startup time of AXIOMsys.  Debian uses similar patch
and claims huge reduction of time needed to run tests, but
for me test time remained effectively unchanged.

-bit of coordination at 'make' time which I forgot to implement.
+The system uses another optimization: database contains a stamp
+(consisting of offset to the main list and build time).  Before

Hmmm, good question. In Aldor-combinat (AC) we deal with combinatorial=20
species. They encode actual structures. The corresponding generating=20
series G(x) for binary trees given by your X above has to fulfil the=20
equation

G(x) =3D 1 + x * G(x) * G(x)                                (+)

As a quadratic formula it has at most 2 solutions. And only one of those =

solution is a power series with only non-negative coefficients. Since I=20
don't know what it should mean to say "there are -5 trees with 3 nodes", =

it is clear which solution I choose for the generating series.

Assuming that I understand a bit of the theory of species, then there is =

only *one* solution to

      X =3D 1 + T * X * X.

We are not yet dealing with "virtual species" which would allow negative =

coefficients in the generating series.

Hmmm, lazyness is important here. Unfortunately the internal definition=20
of formal power series in AC does not allow to write equation (+) as=20
such. One first has to say (something like)

g: FormalPowerSeries Integer :=3D new();
set!(g, 1+x*g*g);

where x corresponds to the inteterminate of "FormalPowerSeries Integer".

No. No pressure intended. It's just something to motivate you. ;-)

Ok, done. I compiled Axiom with the two patches - one for file renames
and one for file cleanup

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00294.ht
ml

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00297.ht
ml

plus the documentation on the axiom-developer.org server with no
problems.
Then I committed this to build-improvements as revision  272. Oops, I
guess
you asked that they be separate commits... Sorry. But the changes are
simple
and related so perhaps better treated as one anyway.

BTW, the output of the algebra/Makefile looks a little strange:

...
rm -rf /home/page/axiom.test/int/algebra/FTEM.NRLIB
copying FTEM.NRLIB to FTEM.o
compiling GENEEZ.spad to GENEEZ.NRLIB
rm -rf /home/page/axiom.test/int/algebra/GENEEZ.NRLIB
copying GENEEZ.NRLIB to GENEEZ.o
compiling GENMFACT.spad to GENMFACT.NRLIB
rm -rf /home/page/axiom.test/int/algebra/GENMFACT.NRLIB
copying GENMFACT.NRLIB to GENMFACT.o
...

Notice how it appears as if the *.NRLIB directory is deleted before
*.NRLIB/code.o is copied! :-) I am sure it is ok but we need to check
the
order of the echo statements.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Well the relevant code is:

.PRECIOUS: ${MID}/%.NRLIB/code.o
${MID}/%.NRLIB/code.o: ${MID}/%.spad
        @ echo compiling $*.spad to $*.NRLIB
        rm -rf ${MID}/$*.NRLIB
        @ (cd ${MID} ; \
           if [ -z "${NOISE}" ] ; then \
            echo ")co $*.spad" | ${INTERPSYS}  ; \
           else \
             echo ")co $*.spad" | ${INTERPSYS} >> ${TMP}/trace ; \
           fi )

Logically removing old file is the first step of compilation. But
because of '@' char make does not echo the compile command, so you
get the output as-is.

BTW: I would write the above as:

${MID}/%.NRLIB/code.o: ${MID}/%.spad
	rm -rf ${MID}/$*.NRLIB
	echo ")co $*.spad" | ${INTERPSYS}  ${COMPOUTPUT}

with COMPOUTPUT beeeing ">> ${TMP}/trace" if we want silent
compilation and "| cat" if we want all messages. Note that
once we remove '@' char the first echo command is useless, since
the second line contains requested information.

I cannot say whether that is a bug or not. I just tend to say it is.
When I started with Axiom, I always wondered about the "elt". Now I 
interpret it as abbreviation of "element" whose meaning is similar to 
extracting the n-th element of an array. So why not replacing "elt" by 
the "." in the form given below?

#include "axiom.as"

P ==> UnivariatePolynomial(x,F);
Q ==> Fraction P;

TestEval(x: Symbol, F: Field): with {
	test1: Q -> Q;
	test2: Q -> Q;
} == add {
	import from P;
	test1(a: Q): Q == a.(1$Q);
	test2(a: Q): Q == elt(a, 1$Q);
}

If you remove test2. That code compiles

F ==> Fraction Integer
P ==> UP(x, F)
Q ==> Fraction P
p1: P := x + 3
p2: P := x+4
q: Q := p1/p2
)co eval.as
T ==> TestEval(x, F)
test1(q)$T

(8) ->
         4
    (8)  -
         5
            Type: Fraction UnivariatePolynomial(x,Fraction Integer)

The interesting part is when one simply writes ...

	test1(a: Q): Q == a.1;

The error message will be...

)set compiler args "-O -Fasy -Fao -Flsp -laxiom 
-Mno-Aldor_W_WillObsolete -DAxiom -Y $AXIOM/algebra -mno-abbrev"
)co eval.as

"eval.as", line 11:         test1(a: Q): Q == a.1;
                     ...........................^
[L11 C28] #1 (Error) There are 2 meanings for the operator `apply'.
         Meaning 1: (Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F) pretend 
IntegralDomain), Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F) pretend 
IntegralDomain)) -> Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F) pretend 
IntegralDomain)
         Meaning 2: (Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)), 
UnivariatePolynomial(x, F) pretend SetCategory) -> 
Fraction(UnivariatePolynomial(x, F)) pretend Type

Ooops, "." is translated to "apply". Well, that is the usual translation 
in Aldor. But since HyperDoc finds only one apply with 2 arguments and 
there the first artument must be a Matrix, it seems that libaxiom.al 
does not reflect the SPAD source code in a 1-1 manner. It is still 
reasonable if we consider elt = apply, but I don't know where this 
translation happened. I could not find it in Broadbery's code that 
builds libaxiom.al. And so I am not even sure about whether elt=apply 
actually holds. I am certainly missing something.

That compiling test2 fails is certainly in connection with elt=apply. 
Who knows...

I realize my sentence could be ambiguous:  I meant "least fixed point

Aha! Good point.  Now, I just need you to point me to a good
introductory point on species.

Well, it seems you have to be even more precise. I still cannot=20
understand that. You mean X, 1, T are continuous partial orders?
And what does then + and =D7 stand for?

| Well, it seems you have to be even more precise. I still cannot
| understand that. You mean X, 1, T are continuous partial orders?
| And what does then + and =D7 stand for?

First consider CPO, the category of complete partial partial orders,
where the morphisms are continuous functions.  Here=20

  * 1 denotes "the" least object=20

  * + is the discriminated union
=20=20
  * =D7 is the Cartesian product


Both "+" and "=D7" are (bi)functors of CPO.  More generally any
"polynomial" expression is a functor in CPO.  For example, if T is a
fixed object of CPO,=20

    X +-> 1 + T =D7 X, where X ranges over CPO

is a functor, so is

    X +-> a + T =D7 X =D7 X

There is a general theorem that says that any polynomial (endo)functor F of
CPO has a least fixed point.  Notice that, in reality, this fixed
point is understood as "F(X) is isomorphic to X", but one usually writes=20
F(X) =3D X.  The set of finite lists of element of type T can be thought
of as the least fixed point of=20

    X +-> 1 + T =D7 X

Similarly, the set of finite binary trees can be thought of as the
least fixed point of=20

    X +-> 1 + T =D7 X =D7 X

The categorial viewpoint explains very neatly the generalization of
the reduce operator (over lists) to more general inductive types.

>=20

It is indeed a remarkable achievement of the level of abstraction
that these formulas are (nearly) identical but refer to seemingly
very different things!

>From a categorical perspective, the + and =D7 above stand for
abstract direct sum and direct product like the disjoint union
and cartesian product of intuitive set theory. Or you can read
the same equation like a production rule in a grammar (universal
algebra) and then + denotes an altenative construction and =D7
denotes a pair (or triple as in the case above). The X denotes
a "production". And the general abstract solution is represented
by a particular structure preserving operation called a functor
which in the example above can be thought of as mapping types
into more complex type structures - lists and binary trees -
this is also called a "functor" or type constructor in Axiom
and Aldor.

>From the point of view of combinatorics (counting structures)
these operations behave just like the usual arithmetic ones,
so we also have the interpretation to which you referred as
the solution of a numerical quadratic equation.

The reference to complete partial orders is a way to define an
ordering or "size" of the solutions of the equation so that it
makes sense to speak of the (unique) "least" or "greatest"
solution.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_partial_order

(Depending on the application the adjective "continuous"
might also be applicable.)

There are other ways to achieve effectively the same thing
in category theory via universal constructions such as limits
and co-limits. The most important thing is to be able to
define abstractly the essential characteristics of the + and
=D7 operations.

>From my point of view, the best way to understand least fixed
points is to also try to understand greatest fixed points at
the same time. As I mentioned in a previous message the Stream
type in Axiom (and some other languages) is related to the
same defining equation as the List functor X =3D 1 + T * X
except that it is greatest fixed point solution rather than
the least fixed point. It is seems easy (trivial?) to understand
the action of the List type constructor but it is a little more
challenging to understand the Stream constructor. Playing with
Stream in Axiom makes this a little easier.

In particular Streams are possibly infinite types corresponding
to possibily repeating sequences of things of a given Type. For
example

    expand(1..)

is the sequence of PositiveIntegers. And

   repeating [1,2,3]

is a sequence of those three Integers repeated 1,2,3,1,2,3,...
indefinitely. In Axiom such infinite repeating sequences have
a convenient finite representation as a circular list (denoted
by a bar over the list of repeated elements).

Now having thought about Stream as a type constructor solution
of the equation X =3D 1 + T * X, I would like to ask you what you
think might be the equivalent greatest fixed point solution of

  X =3D 1 + T * X * X

Recall first that the least fixed point solution corresponds to
the BinaryTree type constructor.

I think I know the answer although I have not seen this written
anyware else, so I want to see if you come to the same conclusion.
:-) Ultimately it is the connection to Azcel and Jon Barwise's
notions of non-wellfounded sets that intrigues me most.=20

Please forgive me for going on about this ...

Bill Page.

Hi,

  This patchlet makes the functions boottocl and boottoclc translators
pretty print their results -- instead of producing long lines of 
unreadable sequences of parenthesis and vertical bars.

I just bootsys from stage 2 to check the results and alter
the cached version.

Built and tested on an i686-pc-linux-gnu.

With this patchlet we return whather shoeNotFound returns when the
input file is invalid.  This behaviour now matches that of other

(insert 'mouth 'foot)

At the risk of getting into trouble, I must agree with Waldek that there
needs to be a distinction between documentation of the system which
describes its workings, and documentation which describes its evolution.
(If that is a fair characterization.)

Changelogs are, AFAICS, what we make them.  If we are planning to remove
or restructure something and want to explain why we are shifting from
the old to the new, that seems to me like a Changelog type of entry.  If
normal changelogs are too brief for what we are after and don't
highlight exact changes, why not create a changelog format that does
what we want?

I have always thought that if we are making Axiom into literate
documents, they should read as such - if I am looking for the pamphlet
that describes the SPAD compiler I am interested in what it IS doing and
what it is intended to do and why, not what it did in the past before it
was fixed.  If I run into a bug I might want to check what changes were
made and why, but that is the precise purpose of a changelog - to
preserve the description of system evolution.  If we want more extensive
changelogs than are standard today, let's define what would work for us.
 However, I must agree that I wouldn't want such things cluttering up
the pamphlet.  If the job that (say, for example) PDP11 specific code
did has no modern equivalent and is no longer needed, removal and a
changelog entry should suffice.  We don't need to document why that code
was there and how it worked if it handles a problem that no longer exists.

That's why I took the approach I did with the Units paper - study the
problem domain, determine what should happen, and then make the code fit
the ideas.  When I tried a Maxima units package I did it the other way
around, and while the code does do some things I rather doubt it would
scale correctly or handle some of the more subtle questions/issues.
Admittedly there isn't working code for Axiom yet, but the eventual
result of the Unit paper approach will be much more useful.

To take another example, I would like to see us first write the
paper/book on WHAT the SPAD language definition is, WHY we want it that
way, and HOW we want it to work (compilation algorithms, compiler design
considerations, etc.).  In the process, we will probably learn how it
SHOULD be done, rather than how it is done now.  The existing code will
be very useful as a reference and some pieces might be drop in, but I
would like to see the ideas lead the code instead of the code leading
the ideas.

In such a paradigm, what the old code was doing is less important than
the question of do we have code that does the right thing?  The pamphlet
literature then is driven not by the existing code but by what the code
SHOULD be, and in that sense adding notes for the reasons for removal of
old code are beside the point of the document.  Such removals should
indeed be explained, but in the changelogs and not the document itself.
 If the changelog should reference specific files/line numbers as part
of its format that makes sense to me - perhaps there is a way to
automate that as part of the SCMs.

Anyway, my 2c.

Cheers,
CY

Aha! Thanks. So whenever I write a spad function "elt" internally it is 
translated to "apply" and thus the interpreter never sees "elt".

Is that interpretation of the snippet correct? Or what is that actually 
translating?

Oh, I must be wrong, since it reads src/interp/ax.boot.pamphlet, ie, it 
belongs to the interpreter.
But what is strange then is that the *Aldor compiler* complains about 
not finding "elt". So this translation must have been done for 
libaxiom.al, since that is the only thing that the aldor compiler sees. 
Sounds like that translation is *not* an interpreter thing. --- No no, 
don't explain. That will pop up again when its time has come.

This is a bug. The problem is that you are trying to work with KAF files
which involve directories as explained by Themos Tsikas. So all function
such as writable? readable? are applied on this directory and not on the
index.KAF file. The behavior of GCL in this regard has changed (since
2.6.7 I think) : it's not possible, actually, to (open ...) a directory
(readable?, internally, uses this) nor to use (probe-file ...) on it.

I'm CC'ing this mail since Waldek Hebisch (will) work on issues related
to this problem and I don't know if it is aware of this problem.

I _think_ that even if you try to modify the Spad file to avoid the
readability/writability tests your library file (KAF) will be unreadable
because of another problem to open (for reading) these types of file.
This bug was fixed by Waldek but actually this fix is only available in
the svn wh-sandbox branch which is highly experimental.

Sorry,

Greg

PS: I think too (I can not test, my version of Axiom has the same bug)
that some objects can not be saved and retrieved, for example
continuedFraction(0). Themos, am I correct?

It wasn't working. I think I've finally tracked it down.

On Mac OS X, the gcl configure option:

--enable-maxpage=256*1024

causes gcl to segfault immediately upon starting.

I'm building axiom now on my Mac, I'm pretty sure it's using the 
contained gcl (the one in build/), and it seems to be working.

What's the default size for this parameter? I'm going to try 128*1024 to 
see if it works, but it's likely pointing to some kind of memory 
management bug, isn't it.

The current build is working with the following configure flags:

# ./configure 
--prefix=/Users/humberto/src/axiom/test/build/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0 
--disable-xgcl --enable-locbfd --disable-statsysbfd 
--enable-machine=powerpc-macosx '--enable-vssize=65536*2' 
--disable-tkconfig --disable-x

Arg.  I don't know what the proper value must be.  The above is what

Bill had a different value for that parameter (which is not a power of

fiddling with that parameter.  Ideally, GCL should just figure out

The short story is I'd recommend leaving out the maxpage at least on
macosx.  In fact, we might make it a configure error at the moment.

The long story is that GCL supports two platforms without OS sbrk, and
therefore emulates same -- Windows and Macosx.  GCL would use some
volunteers to help making this emulation flow more nicely with the
basic settings governing the traditional unix memory model,
e.g. maxpage in the current context.  (I've posted a pictorial
representation of GCL's memory layout -- if anyone is interested I'll
dig up the URL).

On the mac, we have in unexmacosx.c:

/* This used to be the size of the heap, but this is no longer used.  */
#define BIG_HEAP_SIZE 0x50000000

...

/* Size of the heap.  */
int big_heap = BIG_HEAP_SIZE;

...

void *my_sbrk (int incr)
{
  char               *temp, *ptr;
  kern_return_t       rtn;
  
  if (mach_brkpt == 0) {
    if ((rtn = vm_allocate (mach_task_self (), (vm_address_t *) &mach_brkpt,
                            big_heap, 1)) != KERN_SUCCESS) {
      malloc_printf ("sbrk_macosx(): vm_allocate() failed\n");
      abort ();
      return ((char *)-1);
    }
    if (!mach_brkpt) {
      /* Call this instead of fprintf() because no allocation is performed.  */
      malloc_printf ("sbrk_macosx(): cannot allocate heap\n");
      return ((char *)-1);        
    }
    mark_region ((unsigned long) mach_brkpt, (unsigned long) big_heap);
        
    mach_mapstart = mach_brkpt;
    mach_maplimit = mach_brkpt + big_heap;
  }
 ...

In the first raw image produced by gcc, the first thing the mac does
is allocate this huge block, do an image save, and then an exec to the
new image.  The emulated sbrk then steps contiguously through this
preset block until the end.  A real sbrk will continue to append pages
contiguously until the OS is oom, but this is OK (at the moment)
because GCL has maxpages as a compile time limit anyway (this will be
relaxed at some point).  Perhaps all that needs doing is making sure
big_heap and maxpage are synchronized, but I don't fully understand
the memory layout on the mac and whether there are other obstacles
that need checking for, and/or what the signs of collision might be.  

This is probably also why saved images seem larger on the mac than
necessary. 

So in sum an effective limit on --enable-maxpage on the mac at the
moment is something like 0x50000000 / PAGESIZE, which is not checked
by configure.

Other macosx issues that need some loving care by mac afficionados:

1) SGC is not working.  Aurelien ran into difficulties in the past
   getting gdb to trap segfaults properly, without which debugging
   this is almost impossible.
2) i386 support.  I posted earlier that an initial attempt shows a
   failure on launching the first saved image described above, with a
   "Cannot allocate memory" error from the OS (on an 8gb machine)
   before malloc or main are reached.  Something about the layout
   requirements for the new .data section in the saved image must have
   changed.  

I'd like not to spend too much personal time on Windows and Mac, as my
main concern here is the advanecment of free software.  That said I
will make it easy for anyone else so inclined to step in.

Take care,

Thanks!!
I encountered the same issue with the history of Axiom in a file which
is buggy (see
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/323HandlingOfTheHistoryInAFile)

I reported the Library file problem too on IssueTracker.

Hello Bill,

Just wanted to say that I'm very happy with MathAction. There are no
spam actually and it's possible to add link on MathAction without any
problems. Thanks!!!

Greg

Hello,

A small typo in the Axiom book:

--- /home/greg/TDevel/cvs/axiom/src/doc/book.pamphlet

@@ -48550,7 +48548,7 @@

Beware I don't know what \spadfunFrom does.

I don't know either, but src/hyper/pages/util.ht says the stuff below...

Obviously, there are a lot of commands that look pretty much like LaTeX. =

But I guess, hypertex code is not really processed by THE TeX so what=20
language is that actually? And any chance that there is a bit more=20
documentation than that given in util.ht?

Ralf

=2E.. from util.ht

Does somebody know where the file ht.awk is?

All the .ht files say...

% !! DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE BY HAND !! Created by ht.awk.

So if there is/were a script that generates the .ht files, why keep them 
under source code control?

And, Waldek, didn't you say that also the .pht files are generated?

Ralf

It seems that you didn't see that book.pamphlet is a LaTeX book (THE
Axiom book :-) (\spadfunFrom is a LaTeX macro here). I use \spadfunFrom
for Hyperdoc and I like it though it processes incorrectly function
ending with a number (no link are generated).

I asked the same question some days ago (forget the typos)

No other response so I'm assuming it is no longer available.

You asked about a file called 'ph.awk'. I do not know this file, but ...

On Mon, 13 Nov 2006 21:40:41 -0500 I replied to you:

I have a copy of this from the original source distribution from
NAG. For some reason Tim Daly never included it in the open source
version. It appears to contain all the mechanism required to produce
both the Axiom Book and the hyperdoc .ht files from another source
form called .htex files. There are scripts here that extract Axiom
commands and run them to produce output that is inserted in the
.htex files to create .tex files.

Tim, is there any legal reason why you did not include the htex
directory in the open source version of Axiom?

> And, Waldek, didn't you say that also the .pht files are generated?
>=20

Perhaps there is something here also to produce .pht files but
I did not find it right away. Also included in the htex directory
is the original tex linebreak program that is used on MathAction
and in the TeXmacs tm_axiom interface on Windows.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I think we can forget about 'ht.awk': the whole process could not
be very complicated, so it should be easy to create a new script.
But the bigger problem is which workflow _we_ want to have?  IMO
we should stick to a small controlled subset of latex as a main
format and generate rest from it (the point is that once we allow
more Latex features we will spent more time developing tools then
writing documentation).

There is a second problem: .ht files in general contain more precise
markup then 'book.pamphlet', but some differences may be due to
editing done by Tim.  ATM the main difference I see is that
book contains Tex formulas, but hypertex pages use textual output
from Axiom.

> 
> And, Waldek, didn't you say that also the .pht files are generated?
> 

I put the following in 'src/hyper/Makefile.pamphlet':

In the long term, the [[.pht]] and viewports should be generated at either
build time or installation time using commands like:
\begin{verbatim}
             rm -f ht.db
             ${HTADD} *.ht
             for A in `ls *.ht`; do ${SMAN} -paste $$a ; done
             rm -f ht.db
             ${HTADD} *.ht *.pht
\end{verbatim}

Hypertex has special code to extract parts of .ht file and prepare
.input file for Axiom.  Once .input is ready Hypertex tells
AXIOMsys to execute it, writing output to a file.  Then Hypertex
should collect the output into .pht page.

This 'almost' works: some pages are nicely generated, but on other
it stops and one has manually quit Axiom.  It seems that Hypertex
has problem detecting that AXIOMsys finished writing output file.

Yes, this why I say "forget the typos". I think Waldek understood.

All my apologies. I probably forgot because of its possible "no free"
nature. No excuse...

Ok, this is why in util.ht there are some reference to LaTeX as Ralf
pointed out.

Sorry again :-(

Experience trumps ideas ;-), and I must concede with so many SCMs being
used for Axiom a coherent changlog setup is probably close to impossible
in any case.

I think we should make the decision as a project not to wait any longer
for Aldor, and commit to improving SPAD - up until now I think there has
been hesitation to commit serious effort to SPAD due to the possibility
of Aldor becoming available and making such work unnecessary.  To my
mind the first step to improving SPAD is to decide what SPAD should be,
since right now it doesn't have a formal language definition.
Unfortunately I am not an expert in this field.

Hmm.  I thought I knew what I was thinking when I said that, but on
reflection I'm not sure.  Strike it.

You can find the ht.awk script in the src/htex directory in this
tarball

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/public/htex.tgz

See also the src/doc/htex files.

It looks to me like the original Axiom developers had already
given this some thought. Perhaps the src/doc/htex files represent
this sort of process?

Yes, I think so. Tim has been editing the .tex files, not the
original .htex files.

I think that reflects the limitations of hyperdoc that cannot
display actual Tex formulas. On the other hand NAG did have a
commerical version of Axiom that used the Texplorer browser to
display these formula, hyperdoc documentation, and even live
graphics.

Ah, so it is 'htadd' that is supposed to create .pht files from the
.ht files. I see. Is there any documentation of this process?

Wow! How did you learn/know that this functionality even existed?
:-) By reading the code? I am very pleased and amazed.

I tried the following:

For me this is totally clear: SPAD should become a free implementation of the
Aldor language. It would not make sense to have to different languages around.

And, as you know, in my opinion the first step in making this happen is to make
the Axiom interpreter (!) understand Aldor generated code, i.e., dependent
types.

Peter Broadbery is currently making Aldor extend work in Axiom. That's a giant
step, in fact! Unfortuantely, it seems that support for dependent types is even
more difficult. One would have to understand how aldor and axiom work
together. As far as I know, there are only very few people around who know
about this already. 

I guess it's Peter. Laurentiu says he doesn't know about the axiom side, but I
know he knows foam. Tim, do you know about that stuff?  Gaby, Waldek, did you
dig into this connection yet?

This is currently stymied by the aldor compiler not being able to generate .asy files 
where there are dependent types in signatures (try 'foo: (R: Ring, t: R)').  The .asy 
generation code enters a loop, which is a bit poor.  

Even once you've got your dependent signatures into axiom, it has to (presumably) be 
able to interpret them, which will need a more complex type matching process than 
what currently exists (I think).  On the plus side, doing this is a good step towards a 
real compiler.

The mechanism is fairly simple - just fake up objects that look like
aldor domains and categories in axiom (interop.boot does this), and on
the other side interpret asy files as defining axiom types (daase.lisp).
Unfortunately this doesn't add any aldor semantics into axiom, or the
other way round.

That one as well (my mistake).  daase does the reading and setting up
imports, as.boot does the mapping to axiom types.

Does this mean that one would need to modify the Aldor compiler? I.e., we would
need access to the sources?

So, is there any way to make this happen? Money?

I am affraid we will have two different languages: there are legal reasons
and technical ones: I do not see why we should limit ourselfs to capabilites
present in Aldor and (assuming that we want this) implementing _all_
capabilities of Aldor is likely to take long time.  I do not want to
underestimate big things (dependent types) but getting little details
100% compatible would probably take more time.

I do not want to diverge just for beeing different, but agreeing that
we just one _some_ Aldor features in Axiom language is IMHO a better
way: we will not waste time trying to be 100% compatible.

I tend to think that adding dependent types to compiler is easier: compiler
has to do typechecking and probably some runtime support (the rest should
work the same).  Interpreter needs more runtime support and type 
inferencing.  Inferencing is harder. And of course there is added burden
of keeping thing Aldor compatible.

OTOH design of dependent types in Aldor can be criticised.  One thing
is "Type : Type" (personaly I find this reasonable design choice).
Another is using unevaluated parameters (not doing beta convertion)
for typechecking (more precisely for deciding type equivalence).  However,
"Type : Type" + equivalence after evaluating parameters would make compile 
time typechecking undecidable.  I think that we should use evaluated
parameters for deciding type equivalence, but postpone some checking to
runtime.

I looked at extend first: after reading Aldor doc I think that compiler
part should be easy.  Namely, Aldor requires that you import an extension
before you use it.  So basically, all you need is to patch compiler
symbol tables after importing an extension (AFAIU Spad compiler alredy
have needed functionality, to support recompilation in a single image).

More tricky is allowing dynamic loading of extensions: start interpreter,
stash few instances of a type in datastructres, then extend it.  In fact,
this is not very hard if you use double indirection (element -> unique
proxy -> type), but AFAICS Spad uses only single indirection (element
-> type).  I am not sure how well extension works in Aldor interpreter.
My impression is that Aldor uses single indirection and lazyness,
which should work nicely for loading at startup but may have problem
if you load new extensions in the middle of the run.

It is the 'hypertex' program ('htadd' can not do this).  See 
HTXAdvPage5.ht in hypertex documentation (I did not found corresponding
part in Axiom book, so maybe it is missing from printed version).

Yes, reading the code.  Actually, I have found corrct place serching
for embedded paths (I wanted to fix a different problem).  It is possible
that I have read HTXAdvPage5.ht earlier, but since a lot of browser
functionality did not work I would probably ignore it (and forget later).

I applied the patch below to wh-sandbox -- so library and history
handling should now work in wh-sandbox.  The last part (adding slash)
is not needed for the testcase, but my show up in other situations.
ATM Axiom code handles slashes in ad hoc manner: sometimes directory
names end in slashes sometimes names without slashes are used and
slash is added later.  We should use uniform convention here --
probably store directory names without slases and add slases when
forming files nemes (that would agree with Lisp namestring and with
user expectation about filenames).

Indeed.  The Aldor documentation is not free at all, and any attempt to
define Aldor in a literate style would have to duplicate Aldor without
duplicating too closely its documentation - that's a real problem.

I don't know the full history of Aldor, but my impression is that it
grew beyond just being "the language used to implement mathematics in
Axiom" into a more general purpose language.  We need a language to
implement mathematics in Axiom, so hopefully retaining that focus will
make the task somewhat simpler.

Agreed.  One thought - it looks like libaldor and Algebra were Manuel
Bronstein's projects - did he assign copyright to Aldor.org or was it
still his projects and just being distributed with Aldor.org's offering?
 If so perhaps that could make use of those libraries (if they become
available) and target SPAD to support them, perhaps tweaking both as needed.

I know that situation is moving slowly as well (quite understandable) so
perhaps a logical direction to take is look at what features are used in
libaldor, Algebra, SumIT etc. and see what would be required to support
those libraries directly that SPAD doesn't supply.

I think that will be an important discussion to be had as a project -
just how compatible with Aldor we want to stay.

I don't know for you, but I'm not waiting for Aldor.  I've decided a
long time ago to go with SPAD and improve it.  I think I've sid that
many times.  But, yes, the project has to decide.

I've looked into FOAM, yes.

I agree.  I don't believe that the goal of improved SPAD shall be a
clone of Aldor.

This choice must be explored and studied carefully.  Improved SPAD
must ideally have a formal semantics (but, in reallity I suspect we
will only approximate it) and the implications of Type:Type must be
understood, especially since people has expressed many times
connection with proof theory.  I don't consider use of "pretend" a
good solution.

I'm fine with undecidable type checking in general , as long as we
have identified a large subset where it is decidable.

We must also look at how to convince the compiler to do delta
conversion without getting in a blackhole.

I would say that one of the major sins of Axiom code is that it is
hard to say what the code is doing.  More precisely: I belive that
even designers of Axiom could not tell you what Axiom is doing on
invalid inputs.  And while designers had some idea what is 
considered as valid input, Spad compiler accepts without complaint
a lot of garbage.  I belive that in general algebra files give
you better idea about Spad language then the compiler.

So, I belive that if we understand what Spad compiler is doing
with algebra and we implement equivalent functionality in new 
compiler we can reasonably scrap the old one.

You don't need a language to do *just* mathematics in Axiom.  You also
need a language to communicate with the world around.  All major
systems for computation mathematics have grown into that position.
Don't get blindsighted.

[...]

Probably.  I would like to see a discussion about what is necessary to
support computational mathematics in Axiom, rather than how closely SPAD
should ressemble another language.

That is true of any language, especially for any language that evolves.

However, as is the case in many languages, the algebras contains in
many places workaround limitations of the compiler (not just the
language).  Consequently, it is also hard to tell what the language is.

yes, but you'll notice that to get that point, understanding the
existing one is equally important.  

It is not a static thing.  It is a living thing.  Until one gets to
the point where one has an improved version, the current version is
important.  When we have the improved version, the old version would 
be said to *have been* important -- even it *is not* as important
anymore. Software live, breath until they die.  And when they die we
can't rewrite history.

Dear Christian, Gaby, Waldek,

Christian, I'm copying this to you since I think that you have a lot to say
with respect to features and shortcomings of Aldor. I would like to ask you to
join the discussion, time permitting.

Gabriel Dos Reis <gdr@integrable-solutions.net> writes:

I think that this is beyond a group of a dozen part-time developers, and in
fact, I believe that this is very likely beyond the abilities of the average
mathematician. As evidence I'd like to present the "languages" of maple and
mupad, which I believe to be quite inferior (maple: obviously, mupad: very
likely) to Aldor.

Of course, if you or somebody else has the resources, don't hesitate and go
ahead. If not, I'd rather stick (as far as possible) with the semantics of
Aldor.

Don't get me wrong, please: I would not insist on a clone of Aldor, but at
least in the beginning, I think it will be easier to clone certain features.

I did quite a bit of work with Aldor now (within the species project together
with Ralf), and I'm quite convinced of the features of this language. In
particular, the semantics of Aldor feel very "sound" to me, i.e., Aldor usually
does what I expect it to do and allows what I would expect it to allow.

There is another point for staying compatible with Aldor: In that case,
mathematically inclined developers can code using Aldor for the time being, and
switch to a free version when it is available. There is no way I can help with
improving the compiler. But I need dependent types now, not in one or two
years. Thus, I mainly need improvements of the interpreter.

Of course, there are things one might be able to improve, as you showed with
the Monoid - AbelianMonoid example.  However, I do not really see how to
circumvent this in a sensible way.

Furthermore, the restrictions on code in type context (see AUG Section 7.3),
where the Aldor language does not specify when code is evaluated, can be a
pain. (In fact, part of our code is not conforming with respect to this
restriction, although it "works".)

Waldek writes:

I'm not sure about the amount of "little details". In fact, I am too blind to
see any "little details" at all. I don't care to much for exceptions currently,
for example. Is this a "little detail"? Generators, on the other hand, are
really useful, and, it seems to me, beautifully integrated. Other than that, I
guess we need that types are first class objects. 

Gaby pointed out that "==" has different semantics in Aldor and Axiom, but I
have the feeling that this difference is not so severe: in fact, I don't know
of a way to define a constant in SPAD, currently, other than to define a
macro. As far as I know, in Axiom "==" can only be used to define functions
and, in SPAD, types. (Aren't types just a special kind of functions?)

Should we copy this discussion to Stephen Watt? :-)

Martin

Do you also consider to forget about FOAM? I guess, it is not below SPAD 
anyway.

Well, as you know I would rather like to improve the Aldor compiler than 
the SPAD compiler, since that would probably safe some time. But since 
there are no signs that Aldor becomes free, I find Gaby's suggestion 
quite good. Let's discuss, what we want and then design a language that 
fits best. Looking at this Monoid/AbeleanMonoid discussion we had 
before, this language will probably be something else than Aldor and SPAD.

So let me start with a few thoughts.

That Monoid/AbeleanMonoid should be resolved. I want to be able to say 
that the positive integers are a Monoid wrt. + and wrt *.

I would very much like to be able to use any fancy character to denote 
the multiplication of a monoid (not just ASCII). Code should pretty much 
look like actual mathematics. Mathematica and Maple already have some 
kind of that, but it lives in the interpreter. In fact, that would mean 
reducing reduncancy from pamphlets. One would write a mathematical 
formula which would be typeset in the way we like it and at the same 
time be a program.

I would like to define new syntax and use that in a program (nearly) 
exactly as one would do it in a paper.
The literate idea should be pushed to an extreme.

Of course it should also mean to have a way to specify the behaviour of 
algorithms in a formal way so that programs can be checked 
automatically. Proof checkers should, of course, also be written in that 
language.

Yes that is a big dream, but we still have 27 years. ;-)

Sorry, I've been away on business and unable to reach the net.

There are still some files from the NAG release that are not
part of the axiom distribution. If anyone is interested I can
put the NAG released file tree under source code control.

Nope. The axiom conversion to open source took a couple years
and I never got around to handling the hypertex portions. Along
with several other tasks it is still on the todo list.

just a mere compiler to write today codes, it will not excite, not evolve
and therefore will die.  We must not improve SPAD just for what we
want to write today.  We must improve it to handle construct beyond
what we're doing today.

Cloning Aldor is not that much interesting.  People who wants Aldor

I don't propose to forget it.

I strongly disagree on this point. Any character OK, i.e., defining some
operation to be infix or postfix, but please stay with ASCII. You know, not all
keyboards provide all symbols, and it's a pain to look for a certain symbol
when you're on a conference in Prag or China. And no, I don't want to remember
character codes. And no, I don't want to have to use a GUI, since I often work
through a modem.


I agree with

However, I'm afraid, I don't have 27 years left. And, top issue on my priority
list are dependent types. As everybody knows meanwhile. I want to get rid of
that stupid ANY workaround in the series domains.

I'm afraid that I'm more inclined to deeply document the existing
compiler before trying to tackle the problem of language modification.
Experience shows me that all of my programming mistakes occur in places
where my understanding is weakest. So first I understand, then I change.

I was not part of the Aldor compiler effort as I strongly objected to coding
the new compiler in C rather than rewriting the existing compiler. My
contribution to the Aldor effort involved making Aldor work inside Axiom 
and writing a tutorial for the Aldor final product. Despite my objections
I did use the compiler to implement my PhD thesis work.

In fact, I consider this good news: if your contribution was to make Aldor work
inside Axiom, maybe you can help make dependent types coming from code compiled
with Aldor work in Axiom? Peter has made some effort to make Aldor "extend"
work (it does not work yet, it seems), maybe you could shortcut.

Is the interface between Aldor and Axiom documented somewhere?

I would be very happy to pay the price :-)

You won't believe once I told my students to send files in plain ASCII. 
They had no idea what that is. In 10 years we will be laughing about 
that 128 character restriction. Come on... *dream*!

I don't know how much is left for me, but I still have some dreams... ;-)

Hello,

Here is a small patch that fixes the incorrect retrieval of some Streams
from a KAF file. It replaces 'EQ' by 'EQUAL' for comparisons of strings.
There are some other unmodified uses of EQ in this file. They need
further investigations and in particular I need to look at what I
consider a big issue : equality with object of type 'Any' (I postponed
my work on Stream).

I still do this. By the way, currently, I do not have umlauts when ssh'ing from
home to work. Our local support looked at it, but didn't find the reason. Very
likely, it is a problem between Mandrake and Kubuntu. Kubuntu -> Kubuntu works.

I have not yet seen an american keyboard that allows input of german umlauts
without hassle.

I do have dreams: dependent types in Axiom, resolving the Monoid-AbelianMonoid
conflict, having a nice graph theory package, having good support for symmetric
functions... Just have a look at the WishList for some others.

Oh, I think we should drop Mupad-combinat from the wishlist. That's done. :-)

Ralf and you have been doing it in your project, I think.  Basically,
an algebraic type is any data type on can construct with sum and
products.  Examples,

    BinaryTree t = Nil | Node t (BinaryTree t) (BinaryTree t)


Data of algebraic type are constructed with the constructors, and they
are deconstructed through pattern matching. 

Boot has a very limited support for algebraic types, but from what I
understand so far it does not have pattern matching yet.

Well, in fact I need more than that, namely mutually dependent recursively
defined types. I.e., I want to be able to say

A: SomeCat; B: SomeCat;
A == f(A,B) add;
B == g(A,B) add;

as currently possible in Aldor, or, even

l := [SomeDomain, SomeDomain];
l.1 := f(l) add;
l.2 := g(l) add;

(the latter is currently not allowed in Aldor, but it happens to work...)

But I guess, you know that.

Martin

I would love to see some documentation of this work. My
impression is that it was largely done in a "closed" non-
open source manner. Was there a reason for that? Is there a
license issue?

Are you planning to put anything on the Axiom Wiki about
the Axiom/Aldor-combinat work?

Bill Page.

Recursive algebraic types is a redundancy :-)

   A = F(A,B)
   B = G(A,B)

goes without saying.

Ooops. I am really blind... :-( Thanks for telling me the obvious.

 >>> Beware I don't know what \spadfunFrom does.

OK, then let's look at it.

% spadfunFrom records the function name and domain in the index
\newcommand{\spadfunFrom}[2]{{\bf #1}\index{#1 @\begingroup \string\it{} =

#1 \endgroup}\index{#2}}

 From that one sees the intension. You write something like

\spadfunFrom{name}{Type}

prints "name" in the text and also puts two entries into the index.=20
Namely "name" and "Type".

Now when I saw that you replaced "map" by "map!" I thought that must be=20
wrong... But no, there are already other things in book.pamphlet that=20
look like \spadfunFrom{concat!}{List}$(u,v)$. Oh, but then clearly the=20
definition of \spadfunFrom is wrong. It does not consider the case that=20
the exclamation mark is a special character for makeindex.=20
Unfortunately, LaTeX, makeindex, bibtex are not totally compatible. The=20
exclamation mark is used by makeindex to introduce subindices. So it=20
must be escaped by " if it is part of the actual text.

Given that error, you will realize that the index in the Axiom-Book (at=20
least in bookvol1.dvi) is wrong (or if you don't consider it wrong, it=20
is at least ugly).

In order to show that at a small example and also to give a remedy for=20
it I have created the file below where I check for ! (but only at the=20
end of the word) and replace it by "!. In particular look what I did=20
with the second \index entry and how that appears in the index.

Replace \iffalse by \iftrue and investigate the differences in the .dvi=20
file.

Have fun!

Ralf

Are we "closed"? I think I miss something. It is true that we have not 
yet released a tarball but the repository is readable by anyone.

svn://svn.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/hemmecke/combinat

If you cannot read it, tell me and I'll fix it.

Of course, it's a license issue... Is GPL open enough?

Of course. I actually wanted to show the generated html, but did not 
consider that so important, since it is generatable from the sources by 
a simple "make html". Once, we have setup a website, we'll let the world 
know.

I said it is "my impression". By that I mean that the project
appears or looks like it is closed to me. Of course I know
about it from cross-postings to other lists like the aldor
list and the Axiom developer list, but I have never seen any
annoucement about it or any advertisement about it or any
design ideas or other information on the wiki. So to me, yes
it "seems" closed.

Yes I expect that I can, however I am not strongly motivated
to try because I do not know very much about it.

Most open source projects "let the world know" first so that
they can attract interest in the work and maybe more volunteers.

Why not put the output of "make hmtl" on the web now? I think
it is very important.

Why get rid of ANY? What is wrong with this idea? A very similar
idea is used in Java that is often called "type ducking". This
is a way to have dynamic types in an otherwise statically typed
language. What is wrong with that?

But I didn't say "algebraic"! I want it for any functions F, G:

So, in what sense is "algebraic" not covered by the above?

There is nothing wrong with that in certain circumstances or as a temporary
workaround. But it is completely wrong if you can do better without. The on=
ly
reason why series needs ANY is that the type, for example,

UPXS(INT, x, 0)

has a parameter "expansion point", (in the example equal to zero), which is
given as argument to "series":

series(sin x, x=3D1783) returns an element of domain ANY, although it really
should be an element of UPXS(FRAC INT, x, 1783). There is some code hidden =
in
the interpreter that makes the user believe that it is an element of=20
UPXS(FRAC INT, x, 1783), but if you want to use series in SPAD code, you ar=
e in
trouble.

The signature of series currently is

   [4] (D2,Equation D2) -> Any from ExpressionToUnivariatePowerSeries(
            D4,D2)
            if D2 has Join(AlgebraicallyClosedField,
            TranscendentalFunctionCategory,FunctionSpace D4) and D4 has
            Join(GcdDomain,OrderedSet,RetractableTo Integer,
            LinearlyExplicitRingOver Integer)

but it "should" be something like

   [4] (D2,eq: Equation D2) -> UPXS(D2, retract(lhs eq)@Symbol, rhs eq)
            from ExpressionToUnivariatePowerSeries(D4,D2)
            if D2 has Join(AlgebraicallyClosedField,
            TranscendentalFunctionCategory,FunctionSpace D4) and D4 has
            Join(GcdDomain,OrderedSet,RetractableTo Integer,
            LinearlyExplicitRingOver Integer)


Then you could use it also in SPAD.

No problem at all for Aldor.

Martin

Likely you'll want it to live in SVN and since I can't do SVN 
I put the tarball up on axiom-developer.org for a short while.

Please let me know if you're interested in placing it in SVN and, if
you do, please let me know when you've downloaded the tarball
so I can remove it.

Yup.  Reverse engineering the .ao is possible, but not a serious
proposition.

Oops. That's the worst news I heard for a long time. It's time to send email to

It's difficult and practically impossible to use it in Spad. In the
interpreter there is no problem, it coerces it for you (not sure
though). For example imagine that you want to emulate dependent type in
Spad:

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
)abbrev package TEST Test
++ test package
Test(): Exports =3D=3D Implementation where
  I   =3D=3D> integer
  Exports =3D=3D> with
    test: (n:Integer,p:Integer) -> Any
    ++ just a test
    withtest: (a:Integer,p:Integer) -> Any
    ++ just anaother test
  Implementation =3D=3D> add
    test(n,p) =3D=3D
      z :=3D coerce(n::PrimeField(p))$AnyFunctions1(PrimeField(p))
      z
    withtest(a,p) =3D=3D
      --b :=3D retract(test(a,p))-- + 9::PrimeField(p)
      t :=3D test(a,p)
      b :=3D retract(t)$AnyFunctions1(PrimeField(p))
      b :=3D b + 8::PrimeField(p)
      coerce(b)$AnyFunctions1(PrimeField(p))
      --coerce(b)$AnyFunction1(PrimeField(p))
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Here, in function test, you create a type that depends on one of the
parameter passed to this function. In the second function (withtest) you
don't/can't know what is its real type. You first have to coerce it, but
Spad will not allow you to coerce it (via retract@AnyFunctions1) if its
type is not known at compile time. Here it's possible only because the
prime number is known at compile time (p, a function parameter (again)).

Another example:

(4) -> ((1/4)=3D(1/4)::ANY)@Boolean

   (4)  false

That looks strange for me. NullStream and NonNullStream should be
unique objects, so I would probably turn them into symbols.  Your
change would make a one element list:

 ["NonNullStream"]

into invalid stream (I think such list is a valid stream od strings).

I'm done with downloading it.  Thanks! 

Just to make sure. Yes, I would like to have it undr SVN.  I have a
question: Do I legally have the right to do that?

This is because NullStream and NonNullStream are globales variables
(NullStream is a macro (NullStream =3D=3D> $NullStream$Lisp)) but when yo=
u
store a Stream and retrieve it a new string is created and therefore
these strings do not share their memory locations. I do not understand
why you say "Your change would make a one element list", they are just
strings.

If you want )trace STREAM and restore a '[]::Stream(PI)', you'll see:

  1<enter Stream.explicitlyEmpty?,12 : ("NullStream")
   1<enter Stream.frst,10 : ("NullStream")
   1>exit  Stream.frst,10 : "NullStream"
  1>exit  Stream.explicitlyEmpty?,12 : NIL

This is because they do not share the same memory location. The output
of Stream.explicitlyEmpty? has to be T.

I forgot (not the first time) that equal return t or nil so there is no

Sorry, this seems to be an off week for me communication wise.  If we
define and document properly a language like Aldor, we must include
descriptions of the behavior of the language.  The problem with
specifying a language behavior is that the description cannot vary too
much from one description to another and still be defining the same
concepts.  The problem of (for example) writing a document that
describes ANSI lisp without running into any copyright problems is very
difficult, because if you stray too far from the text of the
specification you run the risk of not defining the behavior you need to
define.  And it would be even more difficult to avoid such a description
being a "derivative work" of the previous description.

In Aldor's case, a concrete example would be the language grammar, which
is included in the Aldor User Guide in Chapter 22.4.  If we wanted to
define a similar language I would think any reasonable literate
description of the language would include such a formal grammar
definition.  But Aldor's grammar is defined in this user guide, and at
the beginning of the guide is the statement:

"c 2000 The Numerical Algorithms Group Limited. c 2002 Aldor.org.
All rights reserved. No part of this Manual may be reproduced,
transcribed, stored in a retrieval system, translated into any language
or computer language or transmitted in any form or by any means,
electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise, without
the prior written permission of the copyright owner."

I don't know how exactly the law applies in this situation, but with the
Aldor grammar defined in a copyrighted document we have no permission to
use for anything, how do we handle defining a similar grammar?  Are
grammar definitions not protected?  I don't know how copyright laws
apply in these situations.

Perhaps this is a trivial/silly concern, or something that can be safely
ignored, but it is a concern I thought should be raised.

I would prefer to let the Lisp level handle the outside world as much as
possible.  What are you referring to by communication?  Exporting
algorithms as Fortran code?  Interacting with C libraries?  File and
Data Input/Output APIs?

Agreed.

Gentlemen,

Having just returned from a business trip and being overtired
I made a mistake and copied the wrong directory for upload.
Please delete that copy and I'll upload a corrected version shortly.

OK, thanks for the explanation.

Since I'm not in the business of cloning Aldor, I'm not sure how that
affects Axiom.
I don't see a point of cloning Aldor.  
I see great benefits in an improved SPAD.

But you still need to specify what that does to a SPAD program.  Just
delegating to Lisp does not solve the fundamental problem.

All of that, including interfacing with nay reasonable language used

Fortran and C.

Waldek --

  This patch seems to have broken build-improvements: Many of the
components are no longer built, in particular the regression test is
not longer run.  I spent the whole day tracking down the breakage.
I'll revert this patch, so that you can fletch it out in greater
details, and the branch remains still operational.

There is no dirct error message on console.  However, when I looked at

it does not understand \spad.

I'm running a binary search on another machine, and I'll revert only
when it is cross-checked.

I did the binary search on my laptop, i686-pc-linux-gnu.

False alarm -- they are built "early".  

However.

I think I have a better understanding than I had three hours ago.
The last test I did was with revision 283.

In that revision, the whole AXIOMsys seems to be built twice:

  (1) once as usual
      - then the testsuite is run
  (2) and a second time
      - this time it is not tested any more.
      - this time, the other component are not built

I think it is wrong not to test the second time AXIOMsys is built (it
is the one that is installed).   We would need an explanation of why
AXIOMsys needs to be built twice -- the first time it is tested, and the
second time it is not.  

The dependencies are wrong somewhere but I don't know yet where.
Furthermore, I come realize that the rule

          (cd ../interp && $(ENV) $(MAKE) axiomsys)

is no good.  Because by the time the build flow reaches src/etc/ we may
already have done lot of things on the way (and we do).  Now, it looks
like src/etc wants to ask AXIOMsys to be rebuilt a second time,
without necessarily "making" other things that might depend on it.
That is no good.  We should not have the rule written that way.

I think we must take a step back and lay down what is that the patch
is trying to achieve.  And do that in a more controlled way.
Waldek?



The "generic" errors from hyperdoc are  of the form:

--->/home/gdr/build/axiom/target/x86_64-suse-linux/../../src/algebra/ES.spad-->E
xpressionSpace((odd? ((Boolean) %))): Unexpected HT command: \spad

These may actually be not related to the patch.  Sorry for that.

Yes.  Now, I think I understand what is going go.  See the other
message.  AXIOMsys is built twice.  The first time it is tested, the
second time it is not -- and that is no good.

First, we should not build twice.  Second, if we must build twice,
then we must test the second version -- the one that is installed.

Finally, I think we must rewrite the patch to src/etc/ that introduces
this new behaviour.



Th reason why I thought the branch is broken is that I have a script
that "watches" the output of the build log and it got confused by
the new behaviour.  Then I spend the whole day on it :-/

if you're referring to the $boosttrap hack, yes, I believe that is a

it needs more than explanation, because we don't know whether the

If we want to do that optimization, then we must build AXIOMsys only
twice, I think.  And we must do the same step twice.  Here, the patch
is doing something different the second time.

Yes.

that is true, but it is a different issue from the optimization.
The full SPAD issue is there because because we have no way of

I would suggest that we address the optimization latter -- put it on
the list of README.build-improvements so that we don't forget about it.

yes, it deletes the existing NRLIBs.  
However, I'm not sure where whole SPAD needs to be recompiled, or only
AXIOMSsys.   I believe it is AXIOMsys only.  In that case, we need to 
keep the previous .fn and .data files for latter use.  And it should
be planned ahead.

Given that, I would like to temporarilly revert the patch and work
it out in fuller details.  Opinions?

The function optimization stuff that Schelter and I worked on
requires two compiles. If the optimizing code is loaded and enabled
the first lisp compile has a side-effect output of .fn files. These
.fn files contain static type information that describes the types
of the lisp function call and arguments.

In order to optimize lisp code you:

 1) load the optimizer program (gcl_collectfn)
 2) enable the optimizer
 3) 1st compile the lisp function or file
 4) (lisp generates a .fn file)
 5) load the .fn file
 6) 2nd compile the lisp function or file

If the .fn files are loaded and a second compile is done then there is
a significant speedup of the generated code because the lisp compiler
can almost completely eliminate the function calling overhead.




In axiom this process is planned to be automated during the build 
process (see src/interp/Makefile.pamphlet around line 368). 

The idea is that during an axiom build you generate the .fn files
At the end of each subdirectory such as boot, interp, and algebra
you gather up the .fn files into a proclaims file. Thus the first
time you compile boot you gather up the .fn files into 
src/boot/boot-proclaims.lisp. The first time you compile interp
you gather the .fn files into src/interp/interp-proclaims.lisp.
The first time you compile the algebra you gather the .fn files
into src/interp/algebra-proclaims.lisp

The second time you build the system you can increase the speed
of the build and the speed of the compiled code because you have
cached the correct type information into these proclaim files.

This machinery is only partially built but you can see that it
is partially documented in the Makefile and the partial proclaim
files exist. (src/boot/boot-proclaims, src/interp/interp-proclaims)
These need to be automatically built, cached in the source tree,
 and pre-loaded in the bootsys, interpsys, and axiomsys images.
Someone could create a branch to explore this machinery.

Notice the implications of this for the whole build mechanism.
Past builds create information used by future builds. This
already exists with the databases although there are still
bugs in that process. The end result is that builds are much
faster because two-pass processing can be eliminated and the
generated code is faster even though the build is shorter.




As you guys dive into the code you're beginning to overrun
areas where I've been working.

Indeed, the "new boot" is much more comfortable than "old boot", in
many respects.  It has a preliminary support for (dynamic)
type-checking, algebra datatype and pattern matching. 

I don't think there is much code in Axiom that takes advantage of the 
features of "new boot".

I believe I understand enough of it to start documenting it properly.
Very interestingly, it has much ressemblance with core Haskell.

However, the "new boot" still needs some tuning, but I prefer it over
the "old boot".

Yes, I understood that part.

My question is whether the optimization we're talking about
is about just AXIOMsys, or about whole AXIOMsys+algebras.

I don't believe Waldek's original patch planned any of those
optimizations.  And if it did, then it is not right.

I'll update README.build-improvements to have this item as goal.

I've spent the last couple of days on the "new boot" translator.  I
uncovered a "package hell" bug that I'll fix in a moment.

Then, I'll move on making sure Humberto can build Axiom on MAC, then
support Axiom build without X, then work on the optimization stuff.
I'll be working on/off on documenting "new boot".

Hi,

  The basic idea of this patch is to push into package boottran when
translating Boot files.  

  Apparently, boottran::boottocl is the most tested function.  It gets
it right.  But other similar translation functions (e.g. the cousine
boottran::boottoclc) do not; therefore the will do incorrect translation.
The faults in the output is failure to recognize Boot-specific
keywords or functions.  For example, before this patch

  * boottocl translates true to T         -- correct
  * boottoclc translates true to |true|   -- incorrect.

The reason is that when the current package is not boottran, the
translaters get hold on inexistant translation tables, which
results in their thinking that some identifiers that are special are
not. 

This patch always push into boottran before doing translation.  I've
also made a list of functions for which the behaviour is defined.

Build and tested on an i686-pc-linux-gnu.

	* ptyout.boot.pamphlet (BOOTTOCLLINES, BOOTTOMC, BOCLAM,
	STEVAL, STTOMC, PSTOU): Temporarily push
	into package BootTran and default float format to double.
	(BOOTTOCL): Don't do it here.
	(shoeNotFound): Return nil.

For me that is not a new behaviour:  I have a build log from October 24
and I see this (I think I have seen this much earlier, but ATM I can not
find build logs).

The rule I added is run _before_ testing. However src/input/Makefile
contains the following (corresponging pamphlet is a mess):

TESTSYS=$(axiom_build_bindir)/interpsys

and later:

$(MID)/%.output: $(MID)/%.input
        (cd $(MID) ; \
        echo running test file $* ; \
        echo ')set message test on' > tmp.input; \
        echo ')set message auto off' >> tmp.input ; \
        echo ')read $*' >> tmp.input ; \
        echo ')lisp (bye)' >> tmp.input ; \
        echo 'systemCommand "read tmp.input"' | ${TESTSYS} | tee $*.output; \
        rm tmp.input )

So, src/input/Makefile deliberatly uses different image than the one
beeing installed (I do not think it is good idea -- just notice the
fact).

AFAICS the way to do this it to repeat image building, but pointing
image at new databases.

I have seen them for a long time.  The reasin is in the following
function:

buildHtMacroTable() ==
  $htMacroTable := MAKE_-HASHTABLE 'UEQUAL
  fn := CONCAT(getEnv '"AXIOM", '"/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht")
  if PROBE_-FILE(fn) then
    instream := MAKE_-INSTREAM fn
    while not EOFP instream repeat
      line := READLINE instream
      getHtMacroItem line is [string,:numOfArgs] =>
        HPUT($htMacroTable,string,numOfArgs)
    for [s,:n] in $primitiveHtCommands repeat HPUT($htMacroTable,s,n)
  else
    sayBrightly '"Warning: macro table not found"
  $htMacroTable

This function is supposed to load macros from 'util.ht'.  But when
we do out of tree build 'util.ht' is unavailable during algebra
build (it is installed later).  Also, the path is now wrong and
I am not sure if AXIOM is set during build.

That is not what I see from building any version before 266.

My build log says otherwise.
The second build happens long after the testsing, with:

   [...]
   preloading /home/gdr/build/axiom/target/i686-suse-linux/algebra/INT.o..loaded.
   preloading /home/gdr/build/axiom/target/i686-suse-linux/algebra/LIST.o..loaded.
   preloading /home/gdr/build/axiom/target/i686-suse-linux/algebra/OUTFORM.o..loaded.

Finished loading
/home/gdr/build/axiom/obj/i686-suse-linux/interp/makeint.lisp
6a /home/gdr/build/axiom/target/i686-suse-linux/bin/AXIOMsys created
make[5]: Leaving directory `/home/gdr/build/axiom/src/interp'
6 finished .
rm -f stamp
echo timestamp > stamp
[...]

After AXIOMsys is created, no test is run.


When build control reaches src/interp/ (right after it
leaves src/boot/), it goes on building the images:

   all-ax: $(MID) $(AUTO) stamp
           @echo 618 finished $(srcdir)

   stamp: $(MID) $(AUTO) remove-stamp build-images
           $(STAMP) stamp

Building images consists of building interpsys, AXIOMsys and debugsys.

    build-images: remove-stamp $(SAVESYS) $(DEBUGSYS)


Before your patch, building interpsys also builds AXIOMsys (which is a
copy of interpsys).  Why it must be a copy and not just the original
image, I don't know.  But that is what it is.  Now with your patch,
AXIOMsys is built differently from interpsys after interpsys, and
interpsys is tested but not AXIOMsys (which is installed).

AXIOMsys and interpsys are supposed to be the same image -- that is

it.  But when we make changes we must ensure that those invariants hold.  We
cannot just blame the existing the .  We know the existing

We must do that is a more controlled way.  Unfortunately, we can't
just do a "local" surgery with "goto" previous build.

I'll see.  Interpsys is not installed, I'll see whether its removal is OK.

The discussions I am seeing so far seem to largely indicate that we
need to take SPAD in the direction Aldor went, at least to start with. 
This is not surprising as Aldor itself was intended to fix problems
with SPAD, as I understand the history.

Certainly.  But an improved SPAD probably can't help but look something
like Aldor, since Aldor was in some sense an attempt to do a better
SPAD.

I guess it depends on the details of how such things are handled.  You
are proposing to have code at the SPAD level talk directly to things
like external libraries?  I guess my thought on that was to use
CFFI/other lisp tools to talk to the external libraries, and then use
the lisp level to present an API to them to SPAD.  Admittedly that's
rather vague, but hopefully we would only have to solve the SPAD<->Lisp
part of the equation and leave all the other messy details out of it.

Indeed.  C++, Java, Python, Haskell, CAML, ML, various proof
languages... more I'm sure that aren't leaping to mind.  You know more
about those things than I do Gaby, so perhaps the difficulties are less
severe than I am imagining, but I was under the impression that
translating from one language to another is highly non-trivial. 
Particularly if the program is written in such a way as to assume
communication only with other Java/C/ML/etc. programs.  Lisp's FFI
systems are probably among the most general solutions to such problems,
and even they have a host of issues.  And if we want to eventually
support formal verification and proof generation multiple languages
could exponentially complicate the question - in such circumstances we
would have to query libraries not just for functionality but for proof
that said functionality is correct - and how do we verify the proof
matches the implementation in an external library we may not even have
source code for?  md5 sums some kind?

I wish I knew more about such things.  I suppose at some level any
Turing complete language can express ideas expressed in other
languages, so perhaps there are techniques I'm not aware of.

Cheers,
CY

I meant we have discussed this many times on this list (not

No. I am referring to the fact that mutual dependencies in the
Algebra code are not fully satisfied by the current

  bootstrap (Lisp) -> rest of algeba -> bootstrap (spad)

process. It is necessary to add another iteration

        ... -> rest of algeba -> bootstrap (spad)

before the Lisp code that is generated from SPAD is the same
if the iteration is again repeated (SPAD/Lisp code generation
achieves a "fixed point").

No. The SPAD issue is there because there are mutual dependencies.
Gradually extending domains does not solve this problem.

I believe the current patch is harmless when it comes to the
possible proclaim optimization and that it does achieve the goal
of database optimization (which is a separate issue). Personally
I don't see anything to gain by reverting it.

Hello, 

1/ Can I overwrite only few functions in a package ?

I want to keep exposed the built-in function 
  removeSinSq $ TranscendentalManipulations (Integer, Expression Interger)
and use my own function in my own package :
  expand $ UsualExpand (Integer, Expression Interger)

Is it possible ?

2/ I put this in my .axiom.input file, but it isn't perfect :

)cd
)cd Axiom
)library USEXPAND
)set expose add constructor UsualExpand
)set expose drop constructor TranscendentalManipulations

In this cas axiom uses the built-in expand. I can't do expand (cos (2*x)).

Then I reread the init file : )re ../.axiom.input
And then expand (cos (2*x)) uses the new package.

If I add a first line expand (cos (a+b)) in the init file, at the first line.
then it seems that axiom use the new expand.

But if I add expand (cos (a+b)) at the end of the init file,
then axiom calls the usual expand of TranscendentalManipulations.

Is it a bug ?

This might be possible saying

UsualExpand(R, F) == TranscendentalManipulations(R, F) add

    expand(...) == ...

but I didn't try.

It adds a confusion over an existing tower of confusions. 

Frankly, we all think that the current makefile is a mess.
Unfortunately, the patch adds to that mess even thought it originally
intended to do something good.

Yes, it optimizes the database build but it does not test the result.
I'm less concerned about not doing the proclaim optimization than
testing that nothing is broken by the database optimization.
My proposal is to achieve its goal in a more systematic way.  


This ultimately raised the issue of how to enforce testsuite and the
whole build process.  I don't have much time left this afternoon.  I
know of DejaGnu framework and the QMTest framework for running
testsuite.  I have far more extensive experience with DejaGnu than
with QMTest.  On the other hand, I'm pretty sure people would object
to DejaGnu for various reasons.

I forgot how exactly Axiom behaves (my version of Axiom is modified in
some related regards), but try to play with frame. If I remember
correctly when you start Axiom via the axiom script you're working in
the frame 'frame0' (I'm sure of that). But your package is only exposed
in the first frame (via your commands in .axiom.input), try to switch to
the first frame (')frame next') for example. There are some bad
interactions between package exposition and what Axiom caches I think
(reswitch to frame0 and try to call a function from a non exposed
package but already called in the first frame for example).

Gni? This is strange, thanks for this information.

There are a lot...

Hope that helps,

Sorry, I don't know any of them, but for the Algebra part it might be 
possible to rewrite AldorUnit so that it could be used with Axiom and 
SPAD instead of Aldor.

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/software/aldor/

I could imagine that the rewrite should not be terribly hard.

Yes, the bootstrap might be simpler however it would mean that we
would have to separate existing source code modules into multiple
modules, some of which extend others. But I don't think it would
solve the fundamental problem that there are some cycles of
module dependencies that are irreducibly mutually recursive. The
only way of solving this without iteration of the whole algebra
build would be if we could somehow locate all such dependencies
within a single modules and let the compiler solve the recursion.
I think that this might have been the strategy that the original
developers had in mind since Aldor is specifically able to compile
such code within a single module.

It is still not clear to me how the bootstrap mode flag might
help this situation. I think it would only permit the modules
to be pre-compiled in a more arbitrary order. They could then
be compiled "for real" in a second pass. The way Tim solved
this was to provide actual bootstrap code for selected modules
in the form of previously generated Lisp and then to compile
the rest of the modules in a carefully choosen order.

Ok. Maybe true. But as you said: documentation of what this is

I am all for more simplicity but making something like the
Axiom build simple is likely to take a lot of time and some
more inspiration.

What reasons?

I took a quite look at DejaGnu.

http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu

I did not see anything to which I would immediately object.

I started to do it, no it doesn't seem to be hard. The main trouble is that we
would need to implement TextWriter, but that might be a good thing

Unfortunately, the compiler segfaults over my modifications currently.

Why don't you open it then? Maybe Christian could also contribute. I 
don't see a repository.

BTW, which compiler segfaults?
Where you suggestion to use the Aldor compiler?

How would you see the big picture anyway? (How should 
AldorUnit/AxiomUnit work? How would input files look like? What would be 
generated? What would be compiled? What is a testsuite?)

I can open a repository tomorrow. But I guess that my modifications were quite
stupid....

aldor 1.0.3.

Yes. But this is governed by lack of time.

The Axiom distributioin has a set of .input files that are run as
"regression tests" during the Axiom build, unfortunately there is
currently no facility for automatically checking the results of
these tests. Gaby has suggested DejaGnu and QMTest as possible
tools for automatically running these tests.

See:

http://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu
http://www.codesourcery.com/qmtest

Ralf and Martin mentioned AldorUnit as possibly relevant and suggest
that AldorUnit could be re-implemented in SPAD for Axiom (AxiomUnit).
See:

http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/software/aldor/project.php?id=AldorUnit

To better understand the issue I think we need to distinguish between
System Testing and Unit Testing:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_testing

>From my point of view the primary purpose of the Axiom .input files
and the DejaGnu and QMTest tools is System Testing. To this end,
these tools drive the complete system using a script and comparing
the computed results to the expected results.

Unit testing on the other hand is (usually) and integral part of
the development and usually consists of testing some module or
subroutine locally and in isolation from other units. AldorUnit is
an example of an application program interface (API) intended to
facilitate such tests. Typically one might write unit tests as
additional optional debugging code that tests for expected conditions
(assertions). The testing of these assertions might be enabled or
disabled at run-time or at build-time. Because the assertions are
checks only and are not needed to produce the desired results, they
are usually disabled when running the software in a "production"
mode. As far as I can see currently Axiom development does not
currently employ any unit tests in an essential way.

Unit testing and system testing are not alternatives but rather
should be used together at different stages in software development
and testing.

Regression testing is a part of both Unit and System tests:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing

DejuGnu and QMTest support automated regression testing at the
System level.

DejuGnu also has the ability to drive unit tests through an API
for C++. It is possible to imagine that AxiomUnit could be written
in such as way that it could also be called within DejuGnu for
such tests.

As for objections to DejuGnu and QMTest, I see the following as
possibly significant:

1) DejuGnu depends on TCL this would introduce another dependency
   in the Axiom build environment.

2) Similarly QMTest is written in Python, which would also be a
   new dependency.

Personally I am not concerned about either of these issues.

As for choosing one over the other, QMTest has a nice web browser-
based graphical user interface and is said to work equally well on
Windows, MAC and Linux systems, while DejaGnu is possibly more
mature and integrates directly with the automake/autoconf tools.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi there, 

With great help from Gregory, I have started to implement a wrapper library 
to access GSL (GNU scientific library) functions from Aldor/Axiom. I use the 
Lisp approach with dynamic loading of a shared library.
Yet some of the functions work fine - but there are far to many of them to 
cover them all for the moment. Furthermore, there are some unresolved 
problems (e.g. calling a Axiom/Aldor function from the library code).

agree, but things have to be practical, too.

bootsys is much pickier than depsys about multi-lines lists.  Either
they must be properly indented, or th end-of-line character must be
escaped. as.boot wasn't compliant.  Fixed.

Only I slight correction: I wouldn't reimplement AldorUnit in SPAD but rather
make it compatible with libaxiom. This would save a lot of time.

Just an idea: maybe we could offer Vladimir Bondarenko a bounty for porting
AldorUnit to libaxiom? I could explain him what is needed, and it shouldn't be
difficult at all. Maybe he can use some money? (I'd suggest 100$).

Excellent news! Many thanks. We really need something to "replace" the NAG 
library in the free Axiom.

Just one important moment. GSL is GPL-licensed. So, Axiom wich can be 
linked with GSL (even dynamically) can only be distributed under GPL.

Could you post the patches necessary to make this work?
I have a thread of work similar to this and I'd like to see how you
are doing your version.

This was my intention. I missed some of the functions ...

Good point. The only necessary modification of Axiom is to use a 
dlopen/dlsym enhanced underlying gcl. I consider the remaining part of the 
wrapper (Lisp and Aldor code) as loadable plugin to Axiom. It is external 
and can be distributed separately. Sufficient? 

Furthermore, IMHO the key point is not the existing code (there is not much 
of it existing yet), but a strategy of how to integrate and call shared 
library C functions from Aldor/Axiom - for sure not a circumvent solution 
for any external library written in any language, but at least for some 
cases it works.

Hello,

Can I have in a package a function which define an other function 
from its own parameters ? Why ?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I continue to search pretty expand, combine and rewrite functions over
expressions.

I have already defined a function expandONElevel for the main level
of an expression. 

It's possible to write a recursive map over Expressions 

But how can I utilize it for a recursive map ?

I want to compile, but I can't :

expand (x, MainParameters) ==
  fct1 y == expandONElevel (y, FromMainParameters)
  expandONElevel (recursiveMap (x, fct1))

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can compile a such example but I get internal error when I test it.

I can't write the fct1 function outside the expand function
because I need data from mainParameters.

Here is a minimal? package.

I compile it with a warning : 

; (DEFUN |ESS,mapRec;fct2| ...) is being compiled.
;; The variable |fct| is undefined.
;; The compiler will assume this variable is a global.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the interpreter I add 
  df (x : Expression Integer) : Expression Integer == 2*x

mapRecA... mapRecE are right, but I can't use mapRec.

this test fails : mapRec (sin (3*x)+12*cos(5*exp (y)), df)

   Internal Error
   The function mapRec with signature hashcode is missing from domain
      EssaiMapRec(Integer)(Expression (Integer))

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,

  bootsys has the property that when the input file is malformed, 
it will print out an diagnostic message, partially translate the
input file, prints out a nice message "blah PRODUCED" and return an
exit status 0, as if everything was OK.  That of course asks for 
disaster.

  There are various ways to fix that problem.  One is to modify the
lisp image to propagate back exit status.  Another is work around the
existing behavior by "watching" for the "right" diagnostic messages.
The machinery to do that in the current makefiles started getting
messier with that approach, in addition of duplication.  Consequently,
I abstracted the apparatus and moved it to document.  

  With this patch, we can now translate Boot source code as

    document --tag=boot --mode=translate bootsys foo.boot

of compile a Lisp source file as

    document --tag=lisp --mode=compile gcl foo.lisp

We could get fancier things, but I thought I should just check in the
basic functionality and refine later as needs arise.

this was a known problem. the fix for it was to generate a final
comment in the output file. The build process checks used to
check each generated file for that comment line and fail if it
was not found.

Hello, again and thanks a lot for this good advice !

> Did you try
> 
>    expand (x, MainParameters) ==
>      expandONElevel(recursiveMap, x, ftc1) where
>         fct1 y == expandONElevel(y, FromMainParameters)

I can compile this function mapRec, but the compile rejects all tries
with fct or ftest (in the definition of the mapRec) in fct2.


    mapRec (x, fct, ftest) ==
      map (fct2, #1::F, numer x) / map (fct2, #1::F, denom x) 
       where 
        fct2 (y:K):F == 
          nullary? (op := operator y) => y::F
--          fct (first argument y)
--          L := [fct z for z in argument y]$List F
          op (argument y)
          ftest y => y::F
          y::F

And I can compile it : 
The variables are local inside the mapRec, they are not parameters.
It's like Maple ;-(

    mapRec (x, fct, ftest) ==
      fct1 := fct
      ftest1 := ftest 
      map (fct2, #1::F, numer x) / map (fct2, #1::F, denom x) 
       where 
        fct2 (y:K):F == 
          nullary? (op := operator y) => y::F
          ftest1 y =>  op (map (fct1, argument y))
          y::F

But I can't with     op [fct1 z for z in argument y]. 
I must type          op (map (fct1, argument y))

And I don't understand this last difference...

OK -- was that documented somewhere?
Now we have document takes care of that by looking at the output and
do the right thing.  I can testify it was quite effective.  The other
thing I'm not testing yet is when it says that a file is not found.  I
left that for later refinement.

this is written out if the file is successfully translated.
if the translation fails this line will not exist.
if a grep for this line fails then the translation failed.

Aha, I was working with src/boot ! :-)

So, there effectively is no way to return a meaningful exit status?

Running:

grep -n '^\(1 making a \|37 making \|4 rebuilding databases\|29 making \|.*regression-tests\|.*make axiomsys\)' mlogg

(where mlogg is caputred output from make) gives me:

5131:29 making ./algebra
8911:37 making /var/tmp/hebisch/axp19/ax-build1/int/etc
8914:4 rebuilding databases...
14399:(cd ../interp &&  make axiomsys)
16152:make DAASE=/var/tmp/hebisch/axp19/ax-build1/target/x86_64-unknown-linux regression-tests

97622:(cd ../interp &&  make axiomsys)
97989:make DAASE=/var/tmp/hebisch/axp19/ax-build1/target/x86_64-unknown-linux regression-tests

Before version 266 I saw almost the same picture: only the 'make axiomsys'
lines were missing. As you can see the build process is run twice,
including the rule that I added.  We enter input directory twice,
each time after building AXIOMsys.  Why we do not run regression-tests
the second time?  Well, that is usual make logic: since .output files
depend only on .input and miss dependency on ${TESTSYS} make thinks
that .output files are up to date and do not regenerate them. 

AFAICS we run the build process twice because of top level Makefile
rules:

all-ax:
        @ echo 1 making a ${SYS} system, PART=${PART} SUBPART=${SUBPART}
        @ echo 2 Environment ${ENV}
        @ $(MAKE) stamp-rootdirs
        @ ${ENV} $(MAKE) $(src_stamp)
        @echo 3 finished system build on `date` | tee >lastBuildDate

....

$(src_stamp): $(lsp_stamp)
        cd $(build_srcdir) && $(ENV) $(MAKE)

So we first enter src directory from the recursive part and then the
second time from $(src_stamp) rule.  If you want to avoid second
build just remove the stamp parts from 'all-ax' rule.

Another question is why anything gets rebuild during second run?
interpsys is re-build due to dependency:

$(SAVESYS): $(axiom_build_bindir)


building interpsys changes timestamp of $(axiom_build_bindir) and
triggers re-building of interpsys on the next run.  After removal
of this rule (and stamps part from 'all-ax' rule) re-running make
(with onchanged source directory) did not rebuild anything.

We can easily change input Makefile to test AXIOMsys.  We also
may add dependency on AXIOMsys, so that test are re-run when
AXIOMsys changes.  However, I think we should _not_ run the
tests after re-making AXIOMsys: tests take 15-20 minutes to
run and that IMHO is unacceptable during developement.  In other
words, during developement tests must run exactly when requested.

I think we should have a separate target to build, latex things
and run test and a sepatate target for developement.  I would
prefer to use plain 'make' as a developement target (plus
'make dvi' and 'make check') and 'make build' as a shorthand
for 'make && make dvi && make check', but other arrangements
are also acceptable.

This is a copy of the original CD from NAG marked "Open Axiom Sources".
There are portions of the distribution I've not yet had time to reach.
It might also have some utilities for Waldek's hypertex work.

Gaby, you might want to put this in SVN.

Hello,

My personal experience with Aldor/Axiom Aldor/Algebra, is that
everything that is a bit complicated tend to break miserably. Not only
Aldor Axiom incomparability, but Aldor with libAlgebra.

The compiler is broken, optimization break semantic, some code will
work in O1 not in O2 and vice versa, O3 and O4 can make for some very
efficient optimization that just decide that you code is better left
un executed, faster indeed.
Also seen : incorrect biding of variable, this one was a joy to debug(
Ralf catch it thanks)

I just had a glance at the Aldor source code and no salvation will
come from having it release I guaranty, just a lot of old and lightly
documented C code.

My experience with Aldor is that it obey the principle of maximum
surprise and minimum code productivity.
But it made me happy to code in PPC assembler again, at least the
semantic is clear and debugging is a bliss.

To be honest most of my difficult come from the fact that I am used to
code in ML and I have a functional style that Axiom does not support
really well, anonymous function, and curry style function definition
are a sure way to break stuff.

I personally will not try to implement any new math in Axiom, till the
compiler is in better shape. The good news is that I do believe in the
underlying approach and that being a Comp Sci grad student I might
even be able to do something about it.

Since time to hope for Aldor release has pass, I agree that we should
concentrate on SPAD+,++,prime,#,2006.

I think that Aldor backward combability is not important, since we do
not have libAlgebra or SumIT.
LibAlgebra has tones of copyright in it, from a lot of institution and
individuals. Also merging it with axiom algebra will be quite
difficult. My exploration of the multivariate polynomials
implementation make me believe that libAlgebra is nicer but the
documentation is quite out of sync and a lot is missing.
I never seen SumIT so cant say.

I think the language need to be clearly defined, maybe not a complete
semantic a la SML but at least something precise like the Haskell
report.
We need to be able to decide if it is sound enough and co.

>From a theoretical aspect of SPAD', dependent type seem a must to
accommodate the problem of doing a descent job at representing
mathematics.
But there is dependent type and dependent type, I am in the process of
getting informed about it I got my hand on Pierce thank to inter
library loans, and I am having a look at epigram which I believe is
the only language alive that is implementing depend type.

I would like SPAD' to have a more functional flavor to it( personal taste)

Good news with depend type no need for polymorphisms or GADT !!!

Algebraic type will be great !!! but I guess we will also need pattern
matching to make good use of them.

Also some type inference( I dont mean auto coercion) will be helpful.

For the monoid problem I guess we need something like chapter 6 of
Nicolas Doye PhD thesis.

Also should coercion have a special semantic ?

What to do about Rep ? I dont like it at all, why cant I have
arbitrary number of instance variables named like I want.

I am personally worried about the current :
(that is broken in Aldor and required the horrible "pretend" aka cast)

"if xValue has someSubtype then
	ADT signature extention"

Can we do that in the SML module system with functors ? I should know this :(
( I think I have read that with dependent type we get SML module for free )

Also we have it as control flow in function definition.
"if xValue has someSubtype then"

what about :

"if someType has someSubType then" ?

What are the valuable lesson from SML module system, Haskell type
class, and C++ template  we can use ?

I know there is some effort to improve C++ template system, I guess
Gabriel is quite informed on the subject ?

Should we incorporate axioms for our far away dream of proof checking ?
Before having a proof we could use them for QuickCheck like testing
without too much work.


On a practical point of view.
For me the highest importance will be good error messages during
compilation and possibility of debugging after.
I remember to be quite frighten by SPAD error messages, this being the
reason I switched to Aldor.

I know that compiler book are more interested in advanced optimization
method than good error messages but my own experience in developing a
toy ML language to assembler compiler in Haskell is that monads make
it almost easy, I guess Ocaml error system should make it manageable
too.

I think speed is not important, modern computer are so fast and have
so much memory.( And if we are to plan for speed automatic parallelism
seem the direction of the future but SPAD heavy use of reference will
make it difficult, mabe == should be the rule and := the exception )

FOAM is dead since Axiom doest no understand it.
We still need some intermediary representation, maybe simply lisp.
(Is getting rid of boot still on the agenda ?)

Also I feel that depend type will ask a lot from the runtime system to
do some late type checking.

We do need a FFI interface in the language in someway, maybe Lisp
should provide it but it should be apparent in SPAD'. We should be
able to use http://www.swig.org/.
I dont personal feel the need for FORTRAN by I understand why it will
be important for a CAS.
Having a C interface is of course primordial.

On the syntax side, I am not very found of indentation based syntax,
it work without trouble with haskell and python because they have good
emacs mode but that alway gave me trouble in SPAS, can we have both(
indentation and bracket) like Haskell ? So no need for an holy war.

I guess language design is quite difficult and it is important to know
what kind of problems we need to solve.

My keys test problems will be multivariate polynomials, ore
polynomials, a graph library( data and algebraic), combinat and a
plotting library. I think that it has to be possible to create an
elegant implementation in SPAD' to those problems.


I am motivated, who want a PhD student ?

Regards,
Antoine Hersen

fgrep returns -1 if it fails :-)
no, we hacked up this method and it worked.

there is no documentation because (a) documentation was considered
an afterthought for "the user" and (b) such a simple change wouldn't
be worth commenting on even if it was worth changing the code.

this goes to the very heart of my diatribes on literate programming.
the lesson is painful to put into practice on a daily basis, looking
like some horrible form of overkill and time-wasting  but glaringly 
obvious from a distance of years.

Hello, 

Here is a minimal package which recursively maps an expression.
I can compile it on the silver branch, but I can't use it.

In the interpreter I test :

EI := Expression Integer
pp (x:EI) : EI == x+1
mapRec (sin (sin x), pp)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
)abbrev package ESS EssaiMapRec

EssaiMapRec (R, F): Exports == Implementation where
  R : Join(OrderedSet, GcdDomain)
  F : Join(FunctionSpace R, TranscendentalFunctionCategory)

  K       ==> Kernel F                             
  P       ==> SparseMultivariatePolynomial (R, K)  

  Exports ==> with
    mapRec      : (F, F -> F) -> F

  Implementation ==> add

    import PolynomialCategoryLifting (IndexedExponents K, K, R, P, F)

    mapRec (x, fct) ==
-- in must use a new variable fct1 because I can't compile with fct in fct3
      fct1 := fct
      fct (map (fct2, #1::F, numer x) / map (fct2, #1::F, denom x))
       where 
        fct3 (xx:F):F == mapRec (xx, fct1)
        fct2 (y:K):F ==

Algebraic types without pattern matching is close to useless.  Boot

That one is tricky in presence of auto coercion.  I suspect that we
will be stuck with a mixture of type inference and type checking
(bidirectional typechecking a la Turner--Pierce).  I don't think that
is a bad thing.  Type systems based on Hindley-Milner inference have
evolved to a mixture anyway.

We must have something to say that "here is the representation of a
domain".  There must be a way to impose a view on an existing object.
And Rep does that does job very well.  It is something I misses in
other languages.  The development of "concepts" for C++ has uncovered
that too.

I too dislike this.  But I don't have (yet) a better solution.

The abstract idea being expressed is an important one.  What we need

People are still working on finding better expressive ways with type
classes (predicate over types).  And there are very interesting
problems there.  My impression is that Scratchpad invented a form of
"type classes" before type classes where invented.  And this dates
back to the 70's-80's.  

Over the years people, people have found creative ways to convincing
the C++ template systems to do things it wasn't designed directly to
do. For example, people now use what is called "enable_if" to select
functions templates based on predicates. "Concepts" for C++ will
subsume that creative use of templates.

I think SPAD has to find its solution by introspection.

Definitely.  That is why I'm of the opinion of first nailing down what
we want, i.e. look at existing SPAD codes and see how they can be
improved, how they can be expressed better, what kind of things cannot
be expressed adequately in current SPAD.  I'm not convinced by
feature accretion from other languages.

Gernot,

I'm very interested in your work but I'm still struggling with the
details of the elf-loader so you're way ahead of me. This looks like
a very interesting direction from my point of view. 

If I can get the elf-loader to work it would be simple to lift the
library interfaces and expose them as algebra packages. The key
issue for me is figuring out the low level details of bolting elf-loader
to GCL.

Tim

In the meantime I had a look to www.swig.org, which has been mention on the 
axiom-* lists recently. IMHO it should be possible to generate wrappers 
(lisp and aldor) with this tool - yet there is much black magic inside, 
especially the way to extend swig. Swig supports AllegroCL using FFI which 
is not included with GCL (at the moment)

 From my point of view, integration of elf-loader in Axiom is pretty easy - 
and it opens a world. At the moment limited to my laptop ;-) 

I started this discussion to get feedback if _this_ approach with this style 
of wrappers make sense or if there are better solutions in a private queue 
(Tim and you mentioned independently ideas of an external library/language 
inferface, Gaby implemented a lisp wrapper for a lapack implementation which 
is have the way to be usable within Axiom, ...). 


Thanks 

Gernot

I was going to write a fairly long flame as a reply.  I'll just state
that the aldor compiler is actually  better structured than most 200K+
line pieces of code I've had to deal with.  There are one or two other
statements I'd respectfully disagree with, but I can't be bothered.

The optimiser bugs are painful, and I wish they would be dealt with.
Hell, I'd give it a shot if the code was available.  (or remove the
optimisations, and fix the bits that require optimisation, one or the
other...). 

Naturally, the language isn't to everybody's taste, but does seem to
express a significant number of data structures and algorithms in a form
that people find attractive and useful. 

Dependent types actually require very little in the way of type checking
at runtime - since to the underlying interpreter, everything has more or
less the same type - the compiler does all the complex checking.  The
expensive bit (in terms of code size) is conditionals and parameterised
types, and even there, the time overhead is small if the code does
anything significant with a fixed set of types.  There is nothing here
that isn't done by java, except that types are created by things that
look like function calls rather than comparisons.

To get into some ideas where SPAD or aldor can be improved:

Conditional exports seem to be necessary with parameterised types (it's
a fair point that overloading 'if' is evil, I'd like to see some
alternatives though).

A syntax for naming type constructors in function calls, so

GraphCat(T: HashType): HashType == ...
GraphAlgorithms(T: HashType, G: (T: HashType) -> GraphCategory T) == {
   connectedComponents: G T -> Set Set T;
   connectedGraph: G T -> G Set T;
}	

was more akin to
GraphAlgorithms(BG: (G T == GraphCat(HashType)), X: S T == SetCat(HashType))
   connectedComponents: BG -> S S T;
   connectedGraph: BG-> G G T;
}

So we are not forced to use 'Set'. Unfortunately I can't suggest a nice
looking yet consistent syntax. 

Rep and Per are good for many things, but it might be worth adding a
shorthand for 'my representation is just a record'.  Don't think of Rep
as an instance variable - it's a mapping between your type and an
underlying one.  That said, a default representation of Rep + Record

Peter, perhaps you know ...

The only thing that makes "Rep", "rep", and "per" special is:

macro {
	rep x == ((x)@%) pretend Rep;
	per r == ((r)@Rep) pretend %;
}

from include/aldor.as.

Now let us assume that everywhere in the libaldor sources we would replace

   Rep <--- Foo
   rep <--- bar
   per <--- rab

I guess the compiler would still accept the code and even produces an 
identical library (up to name changes and hash codes etc).

Or does the compiler know about a special treatment of "Rep" (in 
contrast to "Foo")?

Going a bit further... is % known to the compiler? Or could I also 
replace that (above and in everywhere.as file) by something else like 
"Bar", for example?

I'm really curious.

Thanks in advance
Ralf

Yes, correct.  The fact that almost all domains require a representation
is an part of the language, even if the implementation of this is done
via convention.

% is a different thing to the type being defined - this matters for
add-inheritance and in categories.

Gaby,

If you plan to go ahead with the proposed documentation of
"new boot" (aka. SHOE) I would be delighted to help. Perhaps
you have said before, but could you please explain how to
call SHOE from the command line?

What I would like to do is to provide a environment in the
Axiom Wiki, e.g.

  \begin{shoe}
  ....
  \end{shoe}

where we can compile examples of SHOE code. There is already
such an environment for boot

  \begin{boot}
  ....
  \end{boot}

See

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BootProgramming

I am very interested in your comment about the relationship
between SHOE and Haskell.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Gaby,

What is the current status of build-improvements and compiling Axiom
on MAC OSX? Does this work out of the box, i.e. configure && make?
Does hyperdoc and graphics work? I am not able to test this at
the SourceForge farm.

I know someone working on Sage who would very much like to run
Axiom on the MAC so I was just thinking about updating my Sage
package 'axiom4sage-0.1.spkg' to make this easier for them to
install Axiom.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Greetings!  Just FYI -- some email failure appears to have completely
shut off axiom traffic :-(.  I notice on the web a few outstanding
questions -- please try to mail me directly and I will do my best to
answer.   (Cannot possibly do mail outside of emacs :-)).

As for solaris, the default configure and build without

 -DBSD_COMP=bsd_comp -DGNUMALLOC=gnumalloc

should work.  AFAICR, my test machine used gcc, and solaris ld, which
seemed to be the common setup.

Take care,

Humberto,

Have you had a chance to test the latest version of build-improvements
on your MAC?

Anyone else done this?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I've started experimenting with documenting Axiom using video.
You can find the initial attempts, evolving rapidly, at:

http://daly.axiom-developer.org/literate

Please let me know which of the four video formats you prefer.

The AVI format appears to be Camtasia specific and require a
Camtasia codec which can be downloaded from the webpage.

The MOV format is Apple QuickTime

The FLASH format will probably work inline in most browsers.

The WMV format is the Windows Media Format.

Tim

Without installing any new codec or other software, on Windows XP
using FireFox as web browser, clicking on AVI and WMV both start
MicroSoft Media player. I get audio but no video. With AVI, at the
bottom of the window I see:

  No Video? Download the TechSmith Screen Capture Codec
  http://www.techsmith.com/codecs.asp .

With WMV I do not get any explanation of why no video.

I guess I could do that, but as a visitor to the Axiom site I might
be a bit put-off from trying this unless I thought I really needed
to do it.

The MOV and FLASH formats worked right away. No problem. Perhaps
FireFox has built-in support for Flash or else I previously installed
it. MOV takes noticably longer to download. (Is it larger?) Both look
and sound fine on this system. The FLASH version has the annoying
feature of cycling back to the beginning and playing again indefinitely.
I expected it to just stop like the others. In spite of that I
preferred the FLASH version because it was fast to load and display.

Anyway, nice job!

Regards,
Bill Page.

Not yet.

AXIOMsys builds with the internal gcl with just ./configure && make if
you eliminate all references to fink from your path (i.e., no
/sw/bin:/sw/sbin). You may want to symlink latex and makeindex from
/sw/bin to /usr/local/bin.

Waldek posted a patch to fix some issues with openpty that isn't in
build-improvements yet (as far as I can tell, I have version control
system overload):

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00236.htm=
l

I think that's all that's needed to build, but I want to pull a clean
source tree and try again. Maybe over the holiday weekend.

| 
| The patch below tries to 'openpty': add configure check and auguments
| compiler and linker argument.  There are some things which probably
| should be done in different way (please comment):
| 
| 1) configure defines 'HAVE_OPENPTY' preprocessor symbol, this symbol
|    is then propagated via 'DEFS' make variable and compile command
|    line.  Alternatively we could have a common header file generated
|    by configure

Yes, configure can generate a headef file for us to included, instead
of the current hackery of XXXplatform.   
Basically,

  (1) You need to issue

        AC_CONFIG_HEADERS([config/axiom-c-macros.h])

      in configure.ac.pamphlet.  This tells Autoconf (and especially
      Autoheader) that we are going to define CPP macros to
      communicate with thwe C programs, and we want to collect all
      those macros in the file config/axiom-c-macros.h.  Every
      AC_DEFINE you'll issue will end up there.

  (2) Run autoheader.  It should create a file named axiom-c-macros.h.in
      in the config/ directory.  Add it to the repository.

  (3) Modify the INC variable (this really should be set system-wide,
      I think), to include the path to config, e.g. add

        -I$(abs_top_builddir)/config

      [ The reason why I use $(abs_top_builddir) instead of the
       "simpler" $(top_builddir) is that there is a bug in Autoconf
       2.59 that would leave the variable top_builddir undefined.
       That is fixed in later versions, but unless we require Autoconf
       2.60 I think we're better with the absolute path. ]

  (4) Have the C programs include "axiom-c-macros.h"

Hi, 

opening on a not very current FreeBSD using Mozilla fails with the request 
to download plugins.
However, direct download of the mov/avi (e.g. fetch 
http://daly.axiom-developer.org/literate/MakeAxiom_mov/MakeAxiom_mov_media/M 
akeAxiom_mov.mov) and playing in mplayer works fine - but wmv fails with no 
video (audio is ok). wmv could be supported on a more current system due to 
a special codec is required: "DirectShow codec wmsdmod.dll". 

Thanks for the good work, pls proceed with more :-) 

Gernot

Are you referring to the discussion of dependent types in Aldor function
definitions such as

  g(p:PositiveInteger,k:Integer):PrimeField(p) =3D=3D k::PrimeField(p)

This looks innocent and "natural" in Aldor, and in the Axiom interpreter
but William Sit and Ralf Hemmecke showed that in fact this is not really
a function definition in the sense of category theory at all but rather
a functor (i.e. package or domain constructor). See:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-01/msg00207.ht
ml
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2005-01/msg00310.ht

In the Axiom/SPAD compiler you can write such a functor as

g(p:PositiveInteger, k:Integer):with point:()->PrimeField(p)
  =3D=3D add point()=3D=3Dk::PrimeField(p)

The function 'point' is necessary because a functor returns something
of type category. The parameters pick out a particular function from
the category. E.g.

  point()$g(7,4)

>From my point of view this is technically more correct than Aldor's
syntax.

While, I was looking at src/lib to gather unwritten assumptions made by
the C programs, my eyes were glazing over the antiquated K&R C style
declaration of functions. In 2006, we have no more reasons to write C
codes that way.  Especially, none for Axiom.  While I was there, I saw
various "broken" C codes, more on that latter.

I must disagree here: main feature of dependent types is that they
depend on parameters -- one can say that normal types depend only
on constants.  Axiom goes half way here: it allows dependence on
parameters, but only if parameter is a "category/domain/package 
constant", that is you can only use expressions depending on constants
and constructor parameters as parameters for dependent types.

"Full support" for dependent types would require more forms (
function parameters, record fields).  From the point of view of
category theory you may be forced to introduce extra functors,
but I would say that whole point of dependent types is to hide
the extra machinery.

If that works with the spad compiler then why is there a belief that the 
spad compiler cannot handle dependent types?

Maybe the problem is that spad doesn't allow

g(p:PositiveInteger, k:Integer):PrimeField(p) == ...
???

Clearly the result type of g(p,k) depends on the input value of g.

What syntax are you speaking about? I cannot see, why what Bill wrote is 
not Aldor syntax.

I don't understand that. But would you allow something like that in SPAD 
(not the interpreter)?

p: Integer := 5;
k: Integer := 17;
kmod5: PrimeField(p) := k :: PrimeField(p);
p := foo(p); -- results in p=7
kmod7: PrimeField(p) := k :: PrimeField(p);
kmod7 := kmod5 + kmod7

In order to type check that piece of code you need compile time 
evaluation of foo. That is the reason why Aldor requires parameters of 
types to be constant in the given context.
That has nothing to do with "dependent types" though.

Do you use "dependent type" as in

http://www.aldor.org/docs/HTML/chap7.html#4

?

Could you elaborate on this?

In Axiom there would be no problem doing compile-time evaluation
provided the appropriate algebra is loaded.

The patch below eliminates the second build of Axiom and switches
tests to use AXIOMsys.  I also changed creation of target directories
to make it more logical. 

Remark1: We probably should make target directories at before starting
the proper build.  ATM we depend on previous stages to create target
directories which is error prone when we change build order -- in the
patch below I tried to create target directories when needed, but
this gets messy very quickly.

Remark2. From my point of view the stamp stuff in the main Makefile
is not doing anything usefull, Gaby may know what it was intended to
archive.

Remark3. For readability I removed diffs to generated files.

Remark4. ATM I can not test the patch properly, due to test breakage
on build-improvements that I reported earlier.

For me multiple tests give bogus results. Examining the reasons I have
found that 'int/input/INTHEORY.input' contains the following:

AFAICS input parser barfs on Spad syntax giving cascades of error
messages.  Of course, the input parser is right rejecting Spad
-- we should feed it with correct input.

Actually, it looks that three files are affected: INTHEORY.input,
TESTFR.input, VIEW2D.input.

I suspect change to the document script, but have not verified this.

I am now testing the patch below.  The three affected files were
generated from algebra pamplets and corresponding hunks have names
containing spaces inside.

| +\section{Building SAVESYS}

If I understand the logic of the original makefile correctly, there
seems to be a distinction between the image used at compile time, and
the image installed for user consumption.  [Except that that
distinction was never actually implemented, neither in full nor
correctly. ]  Whether that distinction makes sense is something that
needs exploring before we start removing things.  I must confess that
two days ago, I did try a removal of interpsys in one of my local
tree, until I realized that there was an unfinished plan.

My understanding is this:  there is an Axiom image (interpsys) used at
compile time; think of as the image the build machine needs to drive
the compilation.  One of the purpose of such image is for example, to
build some of the algebra needed to build the installed image.  Once
that image is built, with database and all of that, a second build
should be fired up to build the "real" Axiom image.  The one that the
user really cares about.

What is wrong is that the testsuite is run with the compile time image
instead of the one user cares about.

After I saw that, I decided not to remove interpsys, but to write down
what the build flow should.  We need that chart.

Aha!  That problem again! :-(  You probably saw the comment

    # FIXME: Ideally, we should just prepend -R to $chunk
    #        if it is non-null, and say $tangle $chunk $file > $output
    #        Alternatively, we could initialize chunk to '*' and
    #        unconditionally use -R"$chunk".

which indicates I have been there before.  I wrote "ideally" (long
time ago), because I knew it did not work because of spaces in chunk
names.  And my brain must have been GCed and I forgot about it.
Unfortunately, no amont of quotes could get it work properly under
the various circumstances I checked.

The key difference between interpsys (the compile image) and AXIOMsys
(the final user image) is that "warm data" is added to AXIOMsys. A
study I did showed there was a highly skewed distribution of algebra
files which get loaded in any computation (e.g. PositiveInteger is
almost certainly loaded every time). I looked at that distribution
and collected the most frequently loaded algebra files into a list.

interpsys + (the frequent file list loaded) => AXIOMsys

which cuts down on the time it takes to perform computation. It's
one of the dozens of optimizations which make Axiom run reasonably.

The use of ENV in the Makefiles conflicts with established practice
with shells (that are POSIXilly correct).

We have already run make in src subdirectory: the first run is
from recursive part.  So I must ask why do you want to run make
in src subdirectory twice?  My understanding was that you did not
intend that. 

You may say that the problem really is that Makefile in src
subdirectory did not create the stamp.  But in general only
Makefile in subdirectory has knowledge needed to check if targets
are up to date, so we must run make in subdirectories unconditionally.
One make in subdriectory have run extra check on stamp is redundant
(stamps are usefull when you have multiple subdirectories and you
want bulk dependency on another subdirectory, but not in the main
Makefile).

That begs the question: why not put those warm data and files in
interpsys too, so that we only have one image to care about?

Stamp files are used for two purposes in the axiom build.

The first purpose is to prevent rebuilding external subsystems
like GCL and noweb.

The second purpose is to provide a timestamp for the database files.

Because the "warm data" algebra has to be compiled before it can
be loaded. PositiveInteger needs to be compiled in interpsys.

AXIOMsys is a "ship system" and it preloaded the previously compiled
PositiveInteger as well as up-to-date databases. There is a check
(currently broken) that the timestamp in the database files is 
checked against the timestamp of the database files which are 
preloaded into AXIOMsys. If the time stamps of the external database
files match the preloaded databases then the external files are ignored.
If not the external databases are consulted. You can see this because
axiom currently mutters about "reloading" databases when it starts.
This SHOULD be the exception but, as I said, the timestamp mechanism
is broken.

Correct, I don't want to Make src/ twice.  However, there is a
dependency which I think is lost in the removal your suggest.

Before build-improvements was created, Axiom used to build a locally
patched version of GCL which needed objects from src/lib (sockio-c.o
and all that).  So, the very first thing the makefile did (after
building noweb) was to Make src/lib (and not any other sibling
directory). After that, GCL is made, then src is walked starting with
boot/, interp/ and so one.  But you src/ in general depends on
lsp/, which itself depends on src/lib.  

Now that we don't need to build a patched version of GCL, we do
this:
  (1) build noweb if necessary
  (2) build GCL if necessaary -- as if we build on its own; however
         install in $(axiom_builddir)
  (3) build a Lisp image that contains objects from src/lib
      (a) so, we must have built src/lib before building the Lips image.

What shell actually requires such an awkward construction?
Of if you wish why not write:

              chunk=3D"$arg"

or even better :-)

              chunk=3D`echo -n "$arg"`

But I think "quotes" are only needed on argments to external
commands like 'test', not on variable assignments or echo.

And we don't export ENV to submakes, so I don't know if it's doing anything.

In the main Makefile we have:

SUBDIRS = src/lib lsp src

and the recursive part will build subdirectories in this strictly
sequential order.  So, as long as recursive logic remains sequential
stamps are redundant.

I am not sure what you mean: in the main Makefile ENV is make variable
which expands to shell syntax:

VAR1=val1 VAR2=val2 ... command

Do you mean that this syntax is illegal?

In subdirectories make variable ENV is unset, so its expansion is
empty.  Current usage may (I am not sure if it does) add some whitespace
at the beggining of shell command -- I think that leading whitespace
is legal.

The name ENV predates POSIX. Since we control everything about the build
I don't think it matters but there would be no harm in changing it everywhere.

In a shell if you write a line like:

 export FOO=bar command

the "command" can see the FOO shell variable. This is used everywhere
to collect up shell variables used in axiom and pass them down the
tree of calls to make. At each level we dynamically build up the
ENV variable list and then prepend it to the make calls which has
the effect of making the shell variables dynamically visible in the
subtree of makes.

the trouble with this is that is does not work -- I spent a

this one is one needed.

Well, my shell (Zsh) is unhappy with the form chunk="$arg", when cunk

ENV is used as in:

   $(ENV) $(MAKE)

which has the logical effect of exporting ENV to Make.

Furthermore, if the login shell export ENV, then Make (and
sub-processes) sees its changed value whether or not we export it.

No, I mean that different tools have a different idea of what ENV
means; in particular the POSIXilly correct shells want it to mean
something precisely defined.  

Furthermore this particular uses 

  $(ENV) $(MAKE)

means that if you're not at toplevel, then you get the wrong
substitution like in:


  monad[12:04]% make                              ~/build/axiom/src/input
  /etc/bash.bashrc make
  DAASE=/home/gdr/build/axiom/target/x86_64-suse-linux regression-tests
  make: execvp: /etc/bash.bashrc: Permission denied
  make: *** [regress] Error 127


| In subdirectories make variable ENV is unset, so its expansion is
| empty.

No, again you're making the assumption that ENV does not mean anything
particular.  ENV means something very precise is POSIXilly correct
shells.  In particular its value is exported, which means that if you
don't set it, you get what it is supposed to be (not empty).  The
above is an experiment you can reproduce with a POSIX-compliant shell.

The issue is very simple: avoid ENV.  Use MAKEFLAGS (which I'm working on).

It matters that we do avoid using it. Otherwise, we're setting a

README.build-improvements reads:

     Notice that GCL does not support parallel build.  So we can punt
     on build of GCL.  We should work with Camm to fix GCL build

If you remove the dependency, you break parallel builds.
(Currently, you can do parallel builds until you hit algebra --
assumign you don't have to build GCL).

Eh? I have no idea what you're talking about. It is perfectly legal
to set and reference shell variables and this "prefix" technique
is supported as standard syntax by shells. Shell variables are a 
time-honored way of making completely opaque code, making it nearly 
impossible to understand what is going on. Why would you want to 
change that? :-)

Anyway, MAKEFLAGS assumes that the environment variables have something
to do with MAKE, which they don't. MAKE neither knows nor cares about
the environment variables as they are not intended for controlling MAKE.



One example of the shell variable (mis)use in Axiom is the handling
of the PLATFORM variable. This variable is passed on the command line
to certain C calls in a define as in -D${PLATFORM}

Another use is to pass "structural" information such as where the
INT, OBJ, and MNT directories live. You could, for instance, trivially
have done builds "out of the source tree" by simply setting these
variables to other directories. The only reason they point into the
AXIOM subdirectory (although NOT into the "src" directory) is that
the philosophy of the build process states that axiom NEVER writes
outside its toplevel directory. But, as I said, this is trivial to
change by changing the definitions of ${INT}, ${OBJ}, and ${MNT}



So the point is that there are a lot of variables collected into
ENV and they have a lot of different uses and abuses.

ok. s/ENV/GABY/ everywhere.
everything will still work.
ENV is just a local name created 20 years ago.

Is this one missing quotes or does it not matter?

Does not work is too vague.

Why does it fail? What is the result value of $chunk?

>=20

That's very odd. $chunk is just a variable. To use it with -R
as a parameter to notangle I would recommend the following quotes:

  notangle "-R$chunk"

because notangle is an external command.

All of these forms behave identically in my tests using bash
provided that all parameters to external commands are properly
quoted.

Perhaps "3.1: Why does `$var' where `var=3D"foo bar"' not do what
I expect?" in

 http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/shell/zsh

might help?

I fear you are heading for "quote hell" if you do not have the
exact semantics of the shell for which you are designing the
scripts.

Most of your questions can be asnwered as follows:
Uncomment the "set -x" and "set +x" instructions from the document
script and run the script for the files TESTFR.input, INTHEORY.input
and VIEW2D.input. 

   ${INPUT}/TESTFR.input: $(srcdir)/fr.spad.pamphlet
           $(axiom_build_document) --tangle='TEST FR' --output=$@ $<

   ${INPUT}/INTHEORY.input: $(srcdir)/numtheor.spad.pamphlet
           $(axiom_build_document) --tangle='TEST INTHEORY' --output=$@ $<

   ${INPUT}/VIEW2D.input: $(srcdir)/view2D.spad.pamphlet
           $(axiom_build_document) --tangle='TEST VIEW2D' --output=$@ $<

this is purely my opinion but i don't believe that parallel builds
of axiom will ever succeed. i'm willing to be proven wrong and would
find that proof a pleasant surprise.

in sub-optimal builds of axiom this would be extremely difficult.
as soon as you try to do optimization i can't figure out how to 
break the circles in parallel. and i firmly believe that all of
the optimization work inside the axiom build is very important.

axiom could be so much faster if we got the gcl_collectfn mechanism
fully re-implemented. the lisp type optimization code can eliminate
hundreds of intructions per function call and axiom lives and breathes
by function calling. however to fully take advantage of that you 
either need to do multiple passes or cache the type information
from previous builds. doing this in parallel makes my hair hurt.

parallel builds cause the make to go marginally faster but my 
feeling is that the time-to-build is not important for two reasons.

first, a properly done make tree need only rebuild changed files
and their dependent files. when builds used to take 3 weeks from
scratch i was able to build changes to the system in 1/2 hour or so
for small changes using the current makefile structure. that is the
whole reason to use make in the first place. otherwise it just makes
sense to have a linear script.

second, only developers care about build time. the end user should
never see it (or maybe see it once). i'd rather spend a whole day
doing a build and get a highly optimized algebra system than spend
1 hour and get a slow algebra system. and that's saying a lot because
all i ever do is build and rebuild the damn thing.

fast algebra is much more important than fast builds.

Tim, you don't have fixate on me.  As I said, the solution is to use
MAKEFLAGS.  That variable was designed specifically for those kinds
of things.

Not just because it was created 20 years ago means that its usage is
correct today.  The world did not stop spining while Axiom was

It may help to state the *specific meaning* of ENV in POSIX shells. I 
looked at the man page for bash and it says:

  "When invoked as an interactive shell with the name sh, bash looks for 
the variable ENV, expands its value  if  it  is defined,  and uses the 
expanded value as the name of a file to read and execute."

So I can imagine a call to "$ENV sh something" in a makefile to explode. 
What actually happened?

Ok, so we pick shell ENV when we run make in subdirectories.  Yes, that
is good reason to change it to something else.  As quck fix we may just
initialize ENV to empty string (explicit initialization should take
precedence over enviroment variables), but in long term we want different
name.  I am not sure if MAKEFLAGS is really good for us.  AFAIU make
assigns magic semantic to this name, which is different that current
ENV use.  Personally I would change ENV to something like ENV_TO_PASS.

First of, my shell is Zsh, not bash -- but I'm running on a Linux box
so "sh" really is "bash".

Now, the story.  Make needs a shell.  The widely recommended practice
is to use sh.  More specifically, every Makefile shall have this line

    SHELL = /bin/sh

at the very start (unless you're using GNU make, in this case it is
built-in).  You're not obliged to use sh -- for example, sh on SunOS
sucks; you have to use something else, bash or ksh.

There is this line in the Makefile for regression testing:

  regress:
          ${ENV} ${MAKE} DAASE=$(axiom_targetdir) regression-tests


Notice that there is no explicit mention of sh, but Make will call it
because that is the way Make works.

In my case, I stepped into the build directory for input/ and typed
make.  At that point ENV (which is exported by my login shell) has the
value dictated by POSIX, but not overriden by toplevel Makefile.  So
it expanded to /etc/bash.bashrc.

Notice that even if ENV has been overriden by the toplevel Makefile,
that doing is still wrong (it is only a matter of time to trip over
it) because the shell will see that the variable is defined and
attempt to use its value as indicating a file to read and execute.

We can do that too.  Though I'm of the opinion that many of the
variables in current ENV are better defined elsewhere.

But frankly, who is afraid of MAKEFLAGS?  MAKEFLAGS does not just
control Make, it serves as a vehicle to communicate values to
sub-makes and sub-processes of Make.

Test this:

    [13:36]% cat Makefile
    all:
            echo $(MAKEFLAGS)

    [13:36]% make HELLO=BUDY
    echo HELLO=BUDY
    HELLO=BUDY


Any variable defined on the Make command line gets put in the
MAKEFLAGS variable.  This does not work if you put the variable
definition before make.  But, that is not too recommended anyway
(however old it is).

I see two problems with MAKEFLAGS:

1) How portable it is to differnt favors of make?

2) IIUC in GNU make arguments passed via MAKEFLAGS take precedence
over assignments inside Makefile.  This may produce values which are
hard to predict from text of the Makefile and build log.  Values passed via
envioronment do not show in the log, but at least explicit
assignment inside Makefile takes precedence, so one has to track
envioronment only when there is no explicit assignment. Of course, if
you put `echo $(MAKEFLAGS)' before each recursive make invocation
the second problem would go away.

Unfortunately what wasted a lot of time and did not tell me
anything. :-(

All of these commands executed properly on the axiom-developer.org
server without changes to document - probably because of the default
behaviour of bash. See the output attached below.

But I noticed that you have many incorrectly quoted or unquoted
parameters in the document script. Perhaps that is what is causing
your "quote micmac" with zsh. This sort of awkward and obscure
construction is not necessary:

           chunk=3D`echo -n $arg`

I included a patch for document below. The corrected version of
the document script generates the same output as but it is more
robust on other systems with other shells and fully supports
file names that include spaces (e.g. on Windows).

Patch for document:

Everywhere a variable is used in a parameter to an external
command, it must be enclosed in "quotes". Note especially
the command

  $tangle "-R$chunk"

The substitution must be made inside the quoted parameter.

Also the notation

  if test x$do_tangle =3D xyes; then

is old and silly. This looks better and works the same.

  if test "$do_tangle" =3D "yes"; then

BTW, why isn't it

	${MAKE} ${ENV} DAASE=$(axiom_targetdir) regression-tests

?

As far as I understand that, in both cases not ENV is passed to MAKE but 
its value. So the variable ENV would not be set in a subshell unless ENV 
is already set at the beginning.

(Replace ENV by any other variable name if you don't like ENV.)

Works for me.  But I still do not understand this:

       chunk=`echo -n $arg`

thing (despite later messages).  Using bash I can just put

       chunk=$arg

and it works (the problem was on test line).  Zsh manual claims
that word splitting is not done on assignment (and I think
same is true for bash).

Please define more precisely what you mean by incorrectly quoted

notes in Autoconf.

  Shell Substitutions
  ===================

  Contrary to a persistent urban legend, the Bourne shell does not
  systematically split variables and back-quoted expressions, in
  particular on the right-hand side of assignments and in the argument
  of
  `case'.  For instance, the following code:

       case "$given_srcdir" in
       .)  top_srcdir="`echo "$dots" | sed 's,/$,,'`"
       *)  top_srcdir="$dots$given_srcdir" ;;
       esac

  is more readable when written as:

       case $given_srcdir in
       .)  top_srcdir=`echo "$dots" | sed 's,/$,,'`
       *)  top_srcdir=$dots$given_srcdir ;;
       esac

  and in fact it is even _more_ portable: in the first case of the first
  attempt, the computation of `top_srcdir' is not portable, since not all
  shells properly understand `"`..."..."...`"'.  Worse yet, not all
  shells understand `"`...\"...\"...`"' the same way.  There is just no
  portable way to use double-quoted strings inside double-quoted
  back-quoted expressions (pfew!).

are discussing.   Therefore I'm not surprised at all that everything
is OK for you because I did ensure that it worked in the version
you're testing.
The one we're discussing does not have AWK anymore.

| 
| Everywhere a variable is used in a parameter to an external

| the command
| 
|   $tangle "-R$chunk"
| 
| The substitution must be made inside the quoted parameter.
| 
| Also the notation

|   if test x$do_tangle = xyes; then
| 
| is old and silly. This looks better and works the same.
| 
|   if test "$do_tangle" = "yes"; then

However silly it appears to you (and me) I disagree with your removal
of x.  The above has been coded on purpose to be resilient to funky
shells and inputs.


`test' (strings)
     Avoid `test "STRING"', in particular if STRING might start with a
     dash, since `test' might interpret its argument as an option
     (e.g., `STRING = "-n"').

     Contrary to a common belief, `test -n STRING' and `test -z STRING'
     *are* portable.  Nevertheless many shells (such as Solaris 2.5,
     AIX 3.2, UNICOS 10.0.0.6, Digital Unix 4 etc.) have bizarre
     precedence and may be confused if STRING looks like an operator:

          $ test -n =
          test: argument expected

     If there are risks, use `test "xSTRING" = x' or `test "xSTRING" !=
     x' instead.

Ask Tim.

What you show is correct assuming you renamed ENV to something else.

There must be a profond misunderstanding here :-(

Have you tried to do parallel builds?  I tried, but it failed in boot
directory. FYI I changed lsp Makefile to pass '-j 1' to GCL because ATM
on my dual core machines build fails using system GCL (it works using
bundled GCL, also system GCL on single core machines works fine). 

My impression is that you will loose most opportunities for
parallelism: recursive logic is seqential and dependence via stamps
means that one subdirectory must finish before another starts. 
If you make dependency on stamp effective how do you want to
avoid starting two makes (in paralel) in src subdirectory -- make
logic will not prevent this. So, I think that to trurly support paralel
builds you need a single Makefile.

I agree. I did not suggest any changes of this kind.

As I said and as is consistent with your quote, the above is not
necessary. See the case *) above.

Damn. I just can't keep up the pace. :-(

But I kind of suspected this because I was looking for the new:

    document --tag=3Dboot --mode=3Dtranslate bootsys foo.boot

option and didn't find it.

I still think the above way of writing the -R parameter is imporant.

>=20

There is absolutely no risk in the above test. We control the
value of $do_tangle. Anyway this is just a silly style issue.
(Who actually reads this stuff anyway. ;)

On to more important things...

| Works for me. 

Thanks.

| But I still do not understand this:
| 
|        chunk=`echo -n $arg`
| 
| thing (despite later messages). 

It is trying to turn $arg that might be splitted into many strings
(because of over quoting -- despite the popular belief that quoting
should be done systematically) into a single string so that is has
only one quote at the beginning and one quote at the end.

| Using bash I can just put
| 
|        chunk=$arg
| 
| and it works (the problem was on test line).  Zsh manual claims

| same is true for bash).

That behaviour is controlled by options, so the simpler asssignment
which should work is brittle.  You can remove the echo, but PLEASE
don't quote $arg in the assinment.

Yes -- that is how I know which directory fails, which does not.

|  I tried, but it failed in boot directory. 

Then that is a recent bug, because it was working for me no later than
last week (and it has been working for long time now).  

Could you send the build log?  That way we may have a clue about the culprit.

that GCL is not attempted in parallel.

I'm interested in the difference between

    $tangle -R"$chunk"

and 

    $tangle -"R$chunk"

(for true, I don't know the portability issue here; I'm just curious).

There is an interaction between the shell variable mechanism,
the way make expands and overrides variables, and the command line.
 
Axiom's makefile sets AWK=gawk for some platforms.
The AWK variable is collected up in the ENV variable thus:

ENV = .... AWK=${AWK} ...

The way axiom's makefile work you can override the make variables
on the command line thus:

make AWK=nawk

but it appears that this is not true with MAKEFLAGS

Here is a patch to remove the yucky hack.

The shell never sees "$ENV". That's part of the confusion.
The ${ENV} variable is a makefile-level variable which is
expanded by make to read:

SPAD=.... SRC=... INT=... .... make src

The fact that the characters ENV is used as the name of the makefile
variable is a product of history. It would be trivial to rename the
variable from ENV to TPD and everything still works. 

Every programmer knows that the name of a variable in a local
context can be overloaded. I can't imagine why this is even a
point of discussion. There should be NO confusion between a
variable in a makefile and a variable in a shell.

An excellent point. Except that none of the makefiles in the axiom
tree are designed to be executed "standalone". The critical variables
are not defined, e.g. SRC, INT, OBJ, MNT, etc. The fact that ENV has
a meaning in the shell is pure coincidence. 

Executing a makefile that is not designed to be executed is 
guaranteed to fail whether the variable is named ENV or TPD or
any other random name. 

This discussion seems so strange. Can any programmer claim that we
should never use 'if' as a variable name because it has another
meaning? Can you claim that whatever name you choose (e.g. SRC,
INT, BUILD, CVS_RSH, etc) will never be assigned a future meaning
and is therefore safe to use?

| >   regress:
| >           ${ENV} ${MAKE} DAASE=$(axiom_targetdir) regression-tests
| 
| BTW, why isn't it
| 
| 	${MAKE} ${ENV} DAASE=$(axiom_targetdir) regression-tests
| 

First, for defining terms, the "current Makefile" is the makefile
that contains the above chosen line. The "current Makefile" will
try to execute the "new Makefile". So the question is, what will
be the effect in the "new Makefile" of the different order?

Hmmm, the question is one of expansion I suppose. Lets assume that
the current Makefile

SRC=/axiom/src
INT=/axiom/int

ENV = SRC=${SRC} INT=${INT}




then the first expression expands to:

SRC=/axiom/src INT=/axiom/int ${MAKE} DAASE=$(axiom_targetdir) regression-tests

which means that in the newly executing Makefile the variable values of

SRC and INT will NOT be overridden if they are set in the new Makfile
DAASE will be overridden if the are set in the new Makefile




and the second expression expands to:

${MAKE} SRC=/axiom/src INT=/axiom/int DAASE=$(axiom_targetdir) regression-tests

which means that in the newly executing Makefile the variable values of

SRC and INT WILL be overridden if they are set in the new Makfile
DAASE WILL be overridden if the are set in the new Makefile



so the issue is one of overriding the value assignments in the new Makefile.

prefix form sets the environment values but the new Makefile assignments
will be used if they are set.

postfix form sets the environment values but overrides the new Makefile
assignments if they are set.




This is used in axiom now. In the top level Makefile we have a variable
called NOISE. If we want to override that variable we simply type:

  make NOISE=

Yes.

build-improvements sets the variable AWK in Makefiles, derived from
configure findings.  This is set in every generated Makefile.
Consequently it is overridable from the command line.  Try

   make AWK=nawk 

   Overriding Variables
   ====================

      An argument that contains `=' specifies the value of a variable:
   `V=X' sets the value of the variable V to X.  If you specify a value in
   this way, all ordinary assignments of the same variable in the makefile
   are ignored; we say they have been "overridden" by the command line
   argument.


| http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugs/2004-June/007479.html

Notice also that I'm not talking of .MAKEFLAGS, but only values passed
down in MAKEFLAGS.

I don't see this issue affecting build-improvements.

>=20

That should be:

$tangle "-R$chunk"

But in the 4 shells to which I have easy access (bash, sh, csh,
and ksh) there seems to be no difference in behaviour. And I
assume also in zsh. So apparently it is just an issue of style
or folklore. Write that one off...

So, let me get this straight....

You've redesigned the Makefiles so they can be executed standalone.
You tried to execute your new Makefile standalone.
That failed because you use a Makefile variable called ENV 
but do not define it in the new standalone Makefile.

And this is the fault of "the old broken makefiles"?

Sigh.

OK.

[...]

ENV was not chosen by me.  I would not have left a prefix variable
definition in the Makefiles if I had redesigned everything to completion. 

| And this is the fault of "the old broken makefiles"?

I don't know whether it is their fault, but since they are already
broken, they just show another aspect of their brokenness.  I don't
know whether an attribute can be credited as a fault.

Directory src/boot defines its symbols in package boottran.
Why is it that the proclaim files says:

    (make-package "BOOT"  :USE '("LISP"))


Then swicthes to package boot


    (IN-PACKAGE "BOOT") 

before writin out the proclaims?

in version 288 I see:

2006-11-18  Bill Page  <bill.page1@synthesis.anikast.ca>

       * Makefile.pamphlet (LDFLAGS): Add X11 libraries flags.
       * Makefile.in: Regenerate.

Why do we need this: AFAIK sman should not use any X libraries.
In recent build 'ldd sman' gives me:

        libXpm.so.4 => /usr/X11R6/lib64/libXpm.so.4 (0x0000002a9566c000)
        libSM.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib64/libSM.so.6 (0x0000002a95780000)
        libICE.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib64/libICE.so.6 (0x0000002a9588d000)
        libX11.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib64/libX11.so.6 (0x0000002a959af000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/libc.so.6 (0x0000002a95bc4000)
        libXext.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib64/libXext.so.6 (0x0000002a95dea000)
        libXau.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib64/libXau.so.6 (0x0000002a95efe000)
        libXdmcp.so.6 => /usr/X11R6/lib64/libXdmcp.so.6 (0x0000002a96001000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x0000002a96104000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x0000002a95556000)

so now sman will refuse to run on a machine without X libraries.

Gaby,=20

I updated by build-improvements testing repository on and rebuilt
Axiom with no errors. (GCL compiled separately with maxpage option).
Then I repeated your suggested tests (see below), but I got the
same results. No problems. Does revision 301 still fail on your
system?

And some good news: I was able to run your new bootsys (Shoe)
compiler script:

[page@axiom-developer axiom.test]$ cd src/interp

[page@axiom-developer interp]$ document --tag=3Dboot --mode=3Dtranslate
bootsys msg.boot

Hej Martin, could you explan what problem this patch causes? Macros
\spadcmd and \spadsys are used on many Hypertex pages, without them
Hypertex exits when you try to view such a page. Also, pages
alredy contain closing parentheses in system commans so 
\spadsyscom sould not add the second one.

Aaarg.  :-( I don't remember. 
I'm responsible for having checked in Bill's patch.  Bill, did I
pervert your patch?

I think this change:

http://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/axiom/branches/build-improvement
s/src/sman/Makefile.in?view=3Ddiff&pathrev=3D288&r1=3D287&r2=3D288

is not correct. The patch I sent to Gaby is here:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00297.ht
ml

includes the line:

+LDFLAGS=3D -L${LIB} -lspad ${LDF} -lspad ${AXIOM_X11_LDFLAGS}

and

 <<sman>>=3D
 ${OUT}/sman: ${SMANOBJS} ${MIDOBJ}/sman.o
        @ echo 13 linking sman
-       @ ${CC} -o ${OUT}/sman ${MIDOBJ}/sman.o ${SMANOBJS}
+       @ ${CC} -o ${OUT}/sman ${MIDOBJ}/sman.o ${SMANOBJS} ${LDFLAGS}

but in fact ${AXIOM_X11_LDFLAGS} is not needed for sman.

I think we need a more "delicate" approach to providing the right
libraries in the right place, i.e. more autoconf variables.

Bill Page.

On linux it seems to be be possible to remove LDFLAGS for sman,
sesseion and spadclient and rebuild the code in this directory
with no problems.

The patch was motivated by building Axiom on a Sun 280R (sparc,
64bit) Solaris 10 system with a GNU toolchain. My recollection
(not so clear now) is that I added LDFLAGS to the compiles
because of some missing dependencies which were satified by
this option. But a lot has changed in build-improvements since
then. I recently tried to repeat the build on the Sun with a
newer revision but failed and ran out of time.

I think the best thing is to remove the LDFLAGS like this:

Then when I have more time (or Gaby) we can resolve the problem
with building on Sun a slightly different way.

When compiling patch 50, the rootpage cannot be displayed, at least when I add
my guessing package (i.e., building Axiom with it).

I'm not sure whether HyperDoc runs on Patch 50 unmodified, i.e., without my
guessing package, but I think it does not.

I could check tomorrow.

Exactly. That's why I don't understand at all why Tim commented out \spadcmd
and \spadsys and added the close parenthesis. In any case, using the unmodified
version, i.e.,

> > > \newcommand{\spadsyscom}[1]{{\tt #1}}
> > > \newcommand{\spadcmd}[1]{\spadsyscom{#1}}
> > > \newcommand{\spadsys}[1]{\spadsyscom{#1}}

works just perfect.

Dear all,

as you may have noticed, I discovered yet another bug (at least I think it's a
bug) in the output routines:

width((x**2)::OUTFORM) returns 5 instead of 2, and width((1/2)::OUTFORM)
returns (I think) also 5 instead of 1.

So I tried to debug the relevant code, which start at putWidth in
i-output.boot.

However, although I can say, for example

(1) -> putWidth((x**2)::OUTFORM)$Lisp

   (1)  ((** . 5) x 2)
                                                            Type: SExpression


I don't know how to call putWidth from within boot, i.e., after saying )fin.

I.e., how can I access, say, an Axiom variable from boot? I'd like to say
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
p := (x**2)::OUTFORM

)fin

putWidth(p)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
or so.

Martin

there should be a difference between obj/sys/interpsys and
mnt/bin/AXIOMsys. the difference is that interpsys is a build
image and AXIOMsys is a user image. 

the fact that they are the same is due to time pressure. 

i did not have time to polish the details like database
timestamps and the difference between interpsys and AXIOMsys.
there are still portions of the system that do not work
at all such as graphics on windows that need more attention.
it is hardly a surprise that "what is" and "what should be"
differ in the details. worse yet, there are small portions
of the system with insufficient documentation :-)

time, time, time.

In my local tree, I have reorganized src/Makefile so that 

  * algebra/ uses interpsys for compilation
  * etc/ is built after algebra, then generates the database
  * AXIOMsys is built after etc/ complteted
  * input/ directly depends on AXIOMsys, and uses it for testing.

I'm testing.

I'm quite with you!

Yes, silver2 has two versions of util.ht: one in 'src/hyper/pages/util.ht'
and the second one in 'src/share/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht'.  As of
patch 50 silver2 installed version form 'src/share/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht'.
I did not check, but I suspect that patch 49 intalled util.ht from
'src/hyper/pages/util.ht'. build-improvenemts and w-sandbox have only one
version, but picked the one installed by silver2...

You are invited to check wh-sandbox, but ultimatly you must decide which
versions work for you...  FYI wh-sandbox now corrected this problem with
util.ht.

Well, if you want to run Axiom only installed version matters.  But
I think that this case nicely illustrate problems with unused code
-- after seemingly unrelated change the code may get used and
produce wrong results.

Thanks, that seems to do the trick. unfortunately, I seem to be unable to u=
se
boot-syntax in boot-mode :-(

For example, I'd like to interpret

  putWidth u is [[.,:n],:.] =3D> n

but (is (|putWidth| u) [[.,:n],:.])

doesn't work...

Well, I hope still that I can find the bug now, thanks a lot!

In fact, warm data is already in interpsys, and AXIOMsys is just a
copy of interpsys.  

So, I believe we are now back to the question:  If AXIOMsys must be a
copy of interpsys, why do we have both?

I think interpsys is supposed to be just a bootstrapping system for
AXIOMsys, but currently it looks like AXIOMsys is just a copy.

Yes, and that is what is done and it is loaded in interpsys.

[...]

| AXIOMsys is a "ship system" 

I believe "mamouth system" might be more appropriate :-) :-)

I spoke nonsense earlier -- there is no bug here.  Sorry.

The directories in src are not all independent, therefore the rule
cannot be

    all: all-recursive

The rule must be something like

    all: all-ax
    all-ax: <list of targets>

A more simple way (without history):

(cddadr (find-if #'(lambda (a) (eql (car a) 'Q)) (caar |
$InteractiveFrame|))))

Where Q (or for example |a|) is the name of the variable. Sent even if
you already have a response since the mailing list (my provider ?) has
problems.

Hi all,

One small thing that always irked me about Axiom's tex output is that greek=

letters when used as variables don't get translated properly. Maxima gets=20
this right, and it makes the TeXmacs interface a lot more usable. This=20
prompted me to write the attached patch against tex.spad to fix this. I'd b=

happy to see this in the official version.

Here is a _dirty_ way to access them using the history mechanism
available in Axiom. If someone know how to access them easily (in a
different manner) I'm interested too.

First a quick overview of the the history, more precisely the
$internalHistoryTable boot variable and after a dirty way to work with
your interpreter variables.

Here I assume that you work with the history in memory (and not in a
file), which is the default. You can swith to it with:

)hist )mem

The $internalHistoryTable variable (|$internalHistoryTable| in Lisp)
contains all the history; if you want to print it issue in the
interpreter :

)boot $internalHistoryTable

All what I will say about this variable is approximate and represents
simple cases, I have to work on the history mechanism, but I'll do that
later. So please excuse and correct my errors if any.

It's a list of list (Lisp lists). Each list (entries in this mail) in
this list has the form:

((step_number "string"|(list_of_"string")
    (|variable-name| (|value| (Type) WRAPPED data))(+)=20

where

step_numer is an integer, the number displayed in
           the interpreter in front of the command and=20
           the result

"string"|(list_of_"string")
        is the Axiom command and if it is a list
        contains all the previous system command
        (')something foo') and commentaries ('--something')=20
        before it

(|variable-name| (|value| (Type) WRAPPED data))(+) is what
        you want, 'variable-name' is an interpreter variable
        name enclosed in vertical bars, '|value|' is |value|
        (can probably be different so beware). The rest is known,
        I presume, the value ('data'), its type 'Type' and
        WRAPPED. (+) means one or more times.

I hope you understand. Printing the $internalHistoryTable boot variable
will be more clear I think.

In the last item, if |variable-name| is % (not enclosed) this is the
output of your Axiom command (at step 'step_numer' of course). The list
of list is in reverse order. Now you have to know that there is an undo
mecanism in Axiom (costly in term of ressource) so at each Axiom command
all your variables are added to the entry added to the history so the (|
varia...) is repeated for each variables defined. So if you undo 5
commands, for example, with ')undo' Axiom will know their previous
values.

Ok, that's all :-)


So now with that you can "extract" what you want from this variable. For
example, in debugging context, if you DON'T define variables (the simple
case, the last item is not reapeated and it's % instead of |something|)
you can access the output value of the Axiom command at step n with :

(cdadr (third (nth (- n 1)  (reverse |$internalHistoryTable|))))

A simple defun (unwrapped output):

(defun uval (step)=20
  (|objValUnwrap| (cdadr=20
    (third (nth (- step 1)  (reverse |$internalHistoryTable|)))))))

And if you really want to define and access variables (quickly hacked,
quickly tested):

(defun var (a step)
  (|objValUnwrap| (cdadr=20
    (find-if #'(lambda (b) (and (listp b) (eq (car b) a)))=20
       (nth (- step 1)  (reverse |$internalHistoryTable|))))))

To access interpreter variable 'a' at step 3 :=20

(var '|a| 3)


Hope that helps,

Greg


PS : The interpreter store its variables somewhere but I don't know
where. If for example the history is kept in a file, accessing variables
(without undo) does not the involve the history file.

I think there might be some confusion. There is no such thing as
"boot-mode" in Axiom. When you see the BOOT> prompt you are
interacting with the Lisp intepreter. The prompt BOOT> indicates
that you are in the "BOOT" package, i.e. the BOOT namespace which
the default namespace for the Axiom interpreter. (Yes, it is a
confusing name.)

Keep in mind that BOOT is a *compiler*, not an interpreter. You
would first of all have to compile

  putWidth u is [[.,:n],:.] => n

into Lisp code. Then you could enter the result to be interpreted
by Lisp. But I think you would find that rather awkward.

I think what you probably want to do is keep the source code of
the entire routine that you are debugging in a file. Make changes
to it, re-compile it, and load the resulting lisp code - replacing
the previous function definintions. Then execute some test in
Axiom.

Gaby, you are writing here about src/Makefile.  AFAICS src/Makefile
does not use the recursive loop (it just sits unused at the end
of the Makefile).  Concering make logic: my understanding is that
commands for single taget are executed as a shell script (make can
play some tricks here, but this should not affect the result).  In
particular, if you write a shell loop the loop executes sequentially.
The main makefile has such loop and uses it.

The main Makefile is essentially as follows:

all : all-recursive

all-ax: src/stamp

src/stamp:
	cd src && make

all-recursive:
	cd src && make all
	make all-ax

I do not see how you can set up dependencies to correct the above
Makefile (assuming that in src "make all" and "make" give the
same effect).

Now, if you prefer stamps, you can use then, but then drop all-recursive
part.

I feel that you are misallocating resources.  For most of users Axiom
is "fast enough".   OTOH if you compare polynomial factorization in
Axiom with NTL you will notice that Axiom is slower and the gap get
wider on bigger inputs.  NTL is written in C++, but this gives only
little gain.  The main reason is that NTL uses algorithm with better
asymptitic complexity.  So, Axiom also needs faster algorithms
and here build time matters very much.

I would say that if re-making takes more than 1 second then it is
worth working on shortening build time -- while you time saving
from 1 second re-make compared to say 15 seconds is negligible
longer re-make distracts developers attension, causing much bigger
indirect loss.

Also, good practice requires full build before commiting a patch,
so time of full build matters too.  And do not forget about testing
-- we should test freshly build system.

Do not get me wrong: it is nice to have fast algebra.  But you need
developers to make algebra faster, and fast build are necessary to
effectively use developers time (and to get them in the first place).

AFAICS currently interpsys and AXIOMsys preload the same data ("warm.data"

AFAICS the timestamp mechanism works fine, we just need a little change
to Makefiles to preload the new databases.  If you check current
build-improvements you will see that messages about databases are gone.
And the whole tread started discussing this patch.

Hmm, I see:

        for subdir in $$list; do \
           echo "Making $$target in $$subdir"; \
....


This is a loop over subdirectories.  So you can do main target in
parallel with dvi target, but subdirectories run sequentially.

I would put this in a diffent way: you have two rules which invoke
make of main target in src subdirectory.  The first is the recursive
rule, the second one is via src stamp.  Currently the second rule
can only fire after the first run has finished.  But if you allow
both rules to run in parallel then you will get a mess in src.

hmmm, i have no idea why i might have changed this;
which perfectly illustrates two important points...

1) it is important to understand the system before changing it
2) it is important to document the "why" of changes.

clearly i blew it on both points.
mea culpa.

util.ht should be a pamphlet file so we can document our understanding
of the macros and the changes to them but i haven't gotten around
to converting it yet.

OK, I see:  The change that commented out the two commands has date
from 2003 and was applied to 'src/share/doc/hypertex/pages/util.ht'
long time ago. AFAICS Tim 'src/hyper/pages/util.ht' does not contain
this change so I thought that Tim reverted the change.  And I consequently
thougt that uncommenting back the commands caused problems for you.

ATM both build-improvements and wh-sandbox picked version were
the two commands are commented out, while in silver2 the two copies
are inconsistent.

In fact, I would like to do the following change to build-improvements
and wh-sandbox, but your message suggested that you have problems with it.

Dear Waldek,

I'm a little confused now. I thought that I had no problems in patch 49, but
only in patch 50. but looking at the patches, there doesn't seem to be a
difference.

Does this mean that there are different util.ht's around? I just looked at my
local patch 49. The built axiom has in util.ht

% redundant defns for system commands
\newcommand{\syscom}[1]{\lispdownlink{)#1}{(|syscomPage| '|#1|)}}
%
\newcommand{\spadsyscom}[1]{{\tt #1}}
\newcommand{\spadcmd}[1]{\spadsyscom{#1}}
\newcommand{\spadsys}[1]{\spadsyscom{#1}}

which works for me. The other version does not.

I think the best thing would be if I check again tomorrow. Maybe you could just
tell me which Axiom I should build together with my package. wh-sandbox? It
would probably be better to have only one util.ht :-)

In any case, I think only the installed util.ht matters, since these files are
interpreted, aren't they?



Martin

Hi Martin, Waldek

HyperDoc in Patch 50 runs when compiled the first time. After
executing the first part of adding your guessing package, then
HyperDoc does not work.

Alfredo

Gaby, your recent prototype convertion lost return type of spad_error_handler.
I do not understand why Debian gcc-4.1.2 (prerelease) did report this, but
gcc-3.3.5 complained.  The following adds the return type back:

Dear Waldek,

I disagree here. When developing new algebra, I will not immediately integrate
it into the system, i.e., build time doesn't matter at all.

What does matter, and in fact, it is a pain currently, is time needed by the
compiler. That's why I switched to Aldor.

The compiler has the misfeature of taking an incredibly long time on certain
functions, and the amount of time needed changes when you shift the function
definition towards the end of the package, say. For an example, try to compile
my guessing package, with ord1, ord2, deg1, deg2 defined at other places (i.e.,
just before they are needed). I suspect that the reason is that SPAD (the
compiler) remembers imports (since they are mostly done implicitely in SPAD)
and has to try them all before succeeding.

I think time should be mostly spent on documenting and improving compiler, but
I must say that I'm looking forward to the point where adding algebra is
possible :-) 

(currently, it is not possible to add my guessing package, since we would need
to ship a new database as well... As you know, I think the solution would be to
start with an almost empty database and rebuild the database after each layer.)

All the best,

Martin

OK. Could you please send me instructions (if you know how to do it).

* I'd like to debug i-output

* how can I display debugging information in boot, i.e., something like
  output("Hi, I'm here") and output(some-variable).



Thanks,

This is very easy, if you use function names in uppercase, for example
FOO(x), they will be translated to a Lisp call without vertical bars
enclosing the function name so in this example translated to (FOO x):

PRINT("I'm here") or PRINT(my-variable)
Strings will be enclosed with vertical bars, to avoid this use
PRINT('"salut")

Otherwise there are some outputting functions in boot, they generally
begin with 'say' for example sayBrightly. Personally I use PRINT in your
case.

Do you know the meaning of this variable ? It seems to me that some
categories/domains/packages modify it but I have to say that I know
nothing about it.

:-(

Have you looked at the Axiom Wiki pages about boot?

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BootProgramming
 
> * I'd like to debug i-output
> 
> * how can I display debugging information in boot, i.e.,

See the example at:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxIOutput

The commands executed by MathAction to compile and load modified
BOOT code for i-ouput.boot are equivalent to the following:

  )lisp (boottran::boottocl "src/interp/i-output2.boot")
  )lisp (load (compile-file "int/interp/i-output2.clisp"))

Note that there is something hard coded in the old boot compiler
that insists on putting the compiler output in 'int/interp' in
the Axiom source tree.

Please let me know if this example is clear.

You should also feel obligated to add NEW and BETTER examples
to the Axiom wiki. :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hello,

does somebody know the proper method/function to convert between

NNI, PI, SingleInteger, Integer

Complete conversion graph would be interesting.
Note that I am *not* interested in interpreter stuff. I want to know the 
explicit functions that I have to call in a .as file, i.e. the functions 
should live inside libaxiom.al. If possible I want to avoid the use of 
"pretend".

Yesterday, I have tried

coerce: % -> PrimitiveArray S;

from Tuple(S), but the Aldor compiler doesn't seem to know that this 
coercion exists. Any hints?

Furthermore, Tuple in Axiom has the function "select" for accessing the 
n-th element of the tuple. Unfortunately, "select" is a reserved keyword 
in Aldor. What should I do?

Thank you in advance.

Ralf

Hello,

could smb point me how to access the formula parse tree.

what I really want, is to make derivative exercise tool.
which would do the differentiation of (complex) formulas step by step.
And I want to use python :)

for example  Maple has it

I'd like to have parse-tree structure, based on differentiation by
variable (x) ,
each next depth level would mean a step according to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule

so terminal/final nodes should have 'x' or plain numeric expression,
and pre-terminal nodes should have simple differentiatable functions
a subset of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_derivatives,
which contain x and numeric values/variables

I found sth similar what I want in java..
http://www.singularsys.com/jep/doc/html/advanced.html

I also asked in SAGE forum, but seems they don't deal with expression
parsing
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/96686f9ff4ba3711
SAGE folks referenced Maxima.. but I want python, and as I know Axiom is
made with python (Maxima probably with C)..

Thanks in advance

I guss to go from x: NNI to SingleInteger you have to say

retract(x::INT)@SingleInteger

Usually, in axiom, if a "coercion" (in the general, not Axiom sense of the
word) cannot always been done, as for example from INT to NNI or from INT to
SINT, you have to use "retract".

There are two very nice categories, namely KOERCE and RETRACT. Unfortunately,
not all domains have these categories, although they should. The reason is,
that SPADdoesn't know extend.

As soon as extend is available, this must be changed, since it makes
"categorial" programming possible.

I guess there is no "retract" in libaldor?

AFAICS this variable (when set to nil) enables using members of=20
unions in some places where union is expected.  I suspect that it
has only effect on function signatures.  In particular, when this
variable is set to nil Axiom may choose different versions of
overloaded functions.=20

Note that the change I did is a no-op: |$noSubsumption| were set
to t by xrun.boot.pamphlet.

The current document script uses bootsys (the translator for

part of AXIOMsys.  Ideally, I would like to see bootsys replace
the old Boot translator.

As an intermediate solution, we could install bootsys, then
you would translate foo.boot with either

  document --tag=boot --mode=translaye bootsys foo.boot

and that will produce foo.clisp in the same directory, or
you can say directly

   echo '(boottran::boottocl "foo.boot")' | bootsys

If you say

   echo '(boottran::boottoclc "foo.boot")' | bootsys

then the Boot code is included as comment -- but this is is
wiki stuff, who cares?

Basically, SHOE provides a way to define algebraic datatype and way to
deconstruct values of such type.  (There is no type-checking at the
moment, but it would not be hard to implement).  Unlike Haskell,
Shoe does not support (yet) function definition by separate
equations: you have to use a single case expression (which is morally
what Core Haskell does).

   structure BinTree ==
       Nil                         -- the null node
       Node(Val, BinTree, BinTree) -- or a value and a pair of
				   -- binary tree

   depth x ==
      case x of
	  Nil => 0
	  Node(x, l, r) => 1 + MAX(depth l, depth r)

   depth Node(Nil, Node(2, Nil, Nil), Nil)


Notice how the compilation of the body of the structure BinTree
is almost like one would have expected (from a naive translation
point of view).  If properly augmented, Shoe can serve as a good
support for a class on implementation of function languages along the
lines of the now classic "The Implementation of Functional
Proramming Languages" (out of print, but you can download it from the
website)

since the linux binary version does not work
on my Suse/Novell 10.1 amd64 machine
I had to build from source (source from svn, silver version).
I met two problems, fortunately not too difficult:

(1)
 configure just identifies the system as linux, and this leads to
linking errors. The makefile.pamphlet must be modified
so that the variables XLIB and LDF point to 64 bits libraries
XLIB='/usr/x11R6/lib64'
LDF=' -L /usr/x11R6/lib64 -L/usr/lib64 -L/lib64'

and CCF must be supplemented with "-m64"
to make sure that everything is coherent.

(2)
in (axiomdir)/src/doc/bookvol1.pamphlet
two definitions must be erased or commented-out because they are already
in axiom.sty

%% spadgraph are the actual text that you type at the axiom prompt for draw
\newcommand{\spadgraph}[1]%
{\begin{flushleft}{\tt #1}\end{flushleft}\vskip .1cm }

% spadfunFrom records the function name and domain in the index
\newcommand{\spadfunFrom}[2]{{\bf #1}\index{#1 @\begingroup \string\bf{}
#1 \endgroup}\index{#2}}

When they are present, latex hangs, without error message since it is
run in non-interactive mode.

Hello,

could smb point me how to access the formula parse tree.

what I really want, is to make derivative exercise tool.
which would do the differentiation of (complex) formulas step by step.
And I want to use python :)

for example  Maple has it
http://www.adeptscience.co.uk/products/mathsim/maple/whatsnew/maple_presentation.html#MapleAutoBookmark9 



ctrl+F: ShowSteps
or http://www.google.lt/search?q=Student[Calculus1]+ShowSteps

I'd like to have parse-tree structure, based on differentiation by
variable (x) ,
each next depth level would mean a step according to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule

so terminal/final nodes should have 'x' or plain numeric expression,
and pre-terminal nodes should have simple differentiatable functions
a subset of http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_derivatives,
which contain x and numeric values/variables

I found sth similar what I want in java..
http://www.singularsys.com/jep/doc/html/advanced.html

I also asked in SAGE forum, but seems they don't deal with expression
parsing
http://groups.google.com/group/sage-support/browse_thread/thread/96686f9ff4ba3711
SAGE folks referenced Maxima.. but I want python, and as I know Axiom is
made with python (Maxima probably with C)..

Thanks in advance

Thanks for your report.

Most of these are known issues with the current official release of
Axiom.  They are being worked on.  

Configure has been improved to detect the various bits and communicate
with the C compiler and linker.  The LaTeX issue has also been
corrected.  I build Axiom on an x86_64 running SUSE linux 10.1 on
a daily basis.  If you're adventurous you might want to test the
build-improvements branch.

So why not just say what it is supposed to do instead of
making me "experiment"? <sigh>

What contribution is this to documentation of Axiom? :-(

???

I did mean boottran::boot, as I intended boot from package boottran
which is documented (src/boot/ptyout.boot) as

   -- (boot "filename") translates the file "filename.boot" to
   -- the common lisp file "filename.clisp", compiles it and loads
   -- the bbin/o file.

For sure, when I invoke it in boostsy that way, it works for me.

Fixed.  As of today, 'ldd sman' gives:

I mean that your original post seemed obscure and annoying because
you did not explain why you wanted to know. Which implied that I
should already know. An explanation along with the question would
have been more courteous and useful.

Anyway, the Axiom Wiki only runs the AXIOMsys so apparently this
means that 'boottran::boot' is only defined in bootsys.

In the mean time I still don't know what 

  )lisp (boot "src/interp/i-output2.boot")

does in AXIOMsys (presumably the same thing?).

ups.. probably I missunderstood sth.. a few years ago I stumbled upon 
Axiom, and maybe zwiki, and mentioning of python in  
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomDevelopment made me think so...

anyway, could You point me where to look for expression parse API , if 
there is such..

Thanks

Hi,

  I would like to test build-improvements on cygwin, but gcl-2.6.8pre
(and gcl-2.6.7) would not compile there.  If you know of the status of
GCL on cygwin, please tell me; otherwise, I fear Axiom on cygwin will
be delayed till I have time to work on GCL for cygwin (which will be
none this year).

The only reference to Python on the above page is a quote from
Tim Daly who wrote:

"Boot has some nice features. It was basically Python before Python
existed. The key flaw in Boot (and Python) is that programs are not
data." 

There is a general sense in which what Tim wrote it true: While
it is true that Axiom is ultimately written in Lisp, in fact
there are several layers of languages that are defined in order
write Axiom. Boot is the first of these languages. Boot is
compiled to Lisp. Boot in turn is used to implement SPAD - the
language in which the Axiom library code is written.

Take a loot at

Expression parsing is accessible via the InputForm domain.
See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/InputForm

and related discussions in the axiom-developer archives:

gcl-2.6.8pre compiles natively under Windows using MSYS/MinGW.
cygwin is not necessary.

Don't be sorry.  Apparently, I made the incorrect assumption that Bill
was more knowledgeable with the system than he thinks he is.  That
exceedingly annoyed him.  Please ignore my message.

As of version 324 build fails for me.  Most things apparantly build OK,
but sman is missing.  Build fails because build_srcdir in the main
Makefile is unset, and apparently the rule:

$(AXIOM_SRC_TARGETS):
        cd $(build_srcdir) && $(ENV) $(MAKE)

is doing cd to my home directory, where no Makefile is present.

I think you misunderstand. Both your message and Gregory's message
were very useful and should not be ignored. What annoyed me was
how poorly written they were as documentation for how to use boot.
It would have been better to simply point out that what I wrote as
two commands to compile Boot source code to Lisp code and then to
compile and load the Lisp code, can actually be written as one
simple command:

 )lisp (boot "src/interp/i-output2.boot")

The example of 

  )lisp (boottran::boot "src/interp/i-output2.boot")

in your original question, apparently concerning bootsys, was out
of context or perhaps you were not aware that 'boottran' is not
the package name used in AXIOMsys. In AXIOMsys the name of this
function is 'boot::boot'. 'boot' is the default package, so we can
call the function by just the name 'boot'.

The state of the documentation about Boot and how to use it is so
poor that I think we need to do everything we can to improve it.
Writing clear emails containing as much information as possible is
one way to help do this. Eventually the content might be collected
in a more usable format on the web or in a Boot Users Guide.

My level of frustration was heightened by Martin Rubey's recent
request for a "recipe" for how to debug code written in Boot and
which started this thread, since we still have no specific
documentation to which I could point even though this is quite
fundamental to Axiom debugging and development.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I've seen the package boottran used in many places in src/interp,

translator).  Your second message, seems to indicate it is not.
That information was not available to me when I sent my original
message (which was a genuine question), therefore I could not gave
suggested that the single command does the same thing as the two
commands (I knew it was the same for bootsys, I wasn't sure for old
boot).  Which is why I did ask.  But, apparently, I should have not.

Well, I installed all I would find on mingw website.  The configure for
GCL-2.6.8pre failed because it could not find some of the basic
standard headers.  Meanwhile, I learnt what -mno-cygwin can trick GCC
to do.  I'm falling back to that.  It's late, I'm going to bed.

Hello,

I am quite a bit frustrated.

It is clearly not a problem (up to something I have not yet looked into) 
to extend existing Axiom domains from libaxiom.al via some .as files. 
The question now is: How do I use them?

Try

#include "axiom"
extend Integer: with {foo: % ->%} == add {foo(x:%):%==x}

compilation with )compile is no problem, but when I then type

1

I run into a foam error.

Does somebody know how to make "extend"s work in Axiom? Note, I don't 
need the SPAD compiler to deal with "extend" since the Aldor compiler is 
taking care of it. I just want to know a method to let the Axiom 
interpreter know that it now should use the extended Integers and not 
the one from LibAxiom.

Any chance that there is a quick solution?

Thank you in advance
Ralf

PS: If that is too imprecise, I could detail, but at the moment I work 
under Linux and only get a dialup connection with Windows, so it is a 
pain to switch all the time. :-(

I've been looking at this on and off, and haven't come to a good
solution, so this mail is as much to see if anyone else wants to look at
the problem as it is do describe what axiom is doing.

The foam error is 'Circular get encountered' or similar, followed by a
lack of exception raising machinery.  Defining 'fiRaiseException' to
simply throw its argument will do the job here, I expect.

The underlying problem here is that aldor is expecting that the axiom
domain 'Integer' will not be replaced by the new aldor one - however, in
an interpreted environment that is exactly what happens.  As an aside,
in compiled code aldor assigns a hashcode to each extended and
non-extended domain, so they are all kept seperately, and in theory one
can do extends with lexical as opposed to global scope).

In more detail (only the really enthusiastic should keep reading), when
the axiom domain is imported into the aldor runtime (daase.lisp,
process-import-entry), the aldor name is assigned to a domain which is
lazily expanded to the axiom definition of a domain - the lazy expansion
is in interop.boot.  Of course, the load process changes the axiom
definition of the extended domain to be the new aldor one, and a rather
nasty circularity ensues.

There seem to be two ways of fixing this - either 'rescue' the original
domain, and make sure that aldor code can only reference it, or rewrite
the lookup routines to use the underlying axiom style function lookup
vectors (of which I have no real knowledge).

In either case, the 'extend' case needs to be handled seperately,
because in the normal course of events, one expects 'Integer' to be the
latest one loaded into the system.

I have no idea if installing the packages marked current on the
mingw site will work, however I did test the following recipe on
the BuildAxiom page:

  [Install] In the following order:
 
    1. MinGW-5.0.3.exe
 
       This package will install mingw-runtime, w32api, GCC, binutils
       and mingw32-make. See the instructions for Getting Started
 
    2. MSYS-1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe
 
       This installation file contains basic Unix-style commands plus
       a commandline shell. See How to install MSYS
 
    3. msysDTK-1.0.1.exe

       This package provides common packages that are needed by
       developers.

If you are trying to build Axiom from build-improvements I am
sure that will fail because there are patches specfic to Windows
in the axiom--windows--1 branch that were never incorporated
into the axiom--main--1 branch from which build-improvements was
derived.

And of course under native windows you will not be able to build
all of the non-lisp components because some depend on X11 and
some require pty support neither of which is available on native
Windows.

But you can probably get at least some of the missing libraries
required by build-improvements from

http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingwrep

In particular regex is here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7382&package_id=12650

I built gcl-2.6.8pre and Axiom (from axiom--windows--1) in September
as described here:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00625.html
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-09/msg00617.html

If you are serious about building Axiom on Windows, I would be glad to
repeat this to verify that it still works. I would really like to work
with someone to create a new release of Axiom for Windows. The Windows
version is extremely popular if you believe the download statistics but
there seem to be very few people willing to work on Axiom development
on Windows. :-(

If you can make this work, great! Please keep me informed.

Hello,=20

Today I can't obtain sum as sum (1 / factorial n, n) with axiom silver.

Is there someone who has already make a such package ?
Is there someone who is working on ?

This algorithm uses hypergeometric functions and a recursive relation
over polynoms as a(n)p(n+1)-b(n-1)p(n)=3Dc(n) where we are looking for
one polynom p(n) from a(n), b(n) et c(n).

I ask the same question :=20
Are there such packages already done ?
Who is working for such packages ?

Have a good day.

Fran=E7ois, in France.

As far as I know, this sum is not "Gosperable". It is doable by Zeilberger's
algorithm.

Zeilberger is not implemented in Axiom. However, you can use my guessing
package to guess a recurrence. Unfortunately, you have no way to know how many
terms you have to plug in.

Sample session: (PRec is for Polynomially RECursive)

(7) -> guessPRec([reduce(+, [factorial i for i in 1..n]) for n in 1..8])

   (7)  []
    Type: List Record(function: Expression Integer,order: NonNegativeInteger)

(8) -> guessPRec([reduce(+, [factorial i for i in 1..n]) for n in 1..9])

   (8)
   [
     [
       function =
         [f(n): - f(n + 2) + (n + 4)f(n + 1) + (- n - 3)f(n)= 0,f(0)= 1,f(1)= 3]
       ,
      order= 0]
     ]
    Type: List Record(function: Expression Integer,order: NonNegativeInteger)


To obtain the guessing package, send me a note. The version on MathAction is
OK, but contains one or two bugs (irrelevant for most things)

I built GCL and AXIOMsys on Windows recently (last month). It
should still work. How to setup MSYS/MinGW to compile GCL and
Axiom is described here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom

Once built, GCL call be called from cygwin if you wish. This
would be necessary for example to build the parts of Axiom that
depend on pty (like sman) since there is no pty under native
windows.

> Meanwhile, I learnt what -mno-cygwin can trick GCC to do.

Yes, I think it should be possible to cross-compile from cygwin
but that seems like a lot of trouble. If you get this to work
then please let me know.

Bill Page.

Of course you should ask! You did, and I answered. But I did
not understand the intention of your question so I could not
explain in such a way that would be helpful to anyone. Greg's
reply was also useful since eventually you explained what you
had in mind. But we can do all this more efficiently I think...

I think the interface is the same - only the package name is
different (but I have not checked all the details).

Anyway, let me just say: Thank you for the question. :-)

Axiom has implementation of Gosper algorithm -- look at package
GosperSummationMethod.  Unfortunatly, normally Axiom uses Gosper
method only for rational functions.  I played a bit with using
Gosper method for other functions but there are two problems here:

1) Gosper methods is applicable to hypergeometric terms. However, many
expression which "obviously" are hypergeometric terms does not look
like hypergeometric when you take their Axiom representation.
2) Many examples do not work because Axiom can not do needed algebraic
simplifications (famous sqrt(2)*sqrt(3)-sqrt(6) problem).

P.S.  I do not remember if there is a trick to use GospersMethod
from command line -- I probably had to modify and recompile some
algebra files.

Thanks a lot Martin and Waldek,

In fact I'm looking for testing with axiom the sum that my students do.
I hope that axiom computes right (as the two M....) the most possible ser=
ies.
By example students search the series bellow.=20

Are they all hypergeometrics ?=20
this means that u(n+1) / u(n) is an alg=E9braic fraction
as (n-...)(n-...) - - - (n-...)/(n-...) - - - (n-...)

I believe yes but the cos/cosh/sin/sinh.=20
In this case the standard way with complex, combine and expand is right.
The very last one can be find by expand sum ... + sum ...
The only real problem is about the malicious sum ((2^((-1)^n), n)
for n even and n odd.

Am I right ?

Theses exercices have a closed form so the Gosper algorithm gives the=20
solution as a hypergeometric serie.

Am I right (again) ?

How can I use the GosperPackage :=20
I don't know how to use the signature for the command=20

    GosperMethod (Q, V, ()-> V) -> Union (Q, "failed")
            ++ GospersMethod(b, n, new) returns a rational function
            ++ \spad{rf(n)} such that \spad{a(n) * rf(n)} is the indefini=
te
            ++ sum of \spad{a(n)}
            ++ with respect to upward difference on \spad{n}, i.e.
            ++ \spad{a(n+1) * rf(n+1) - a(n) * rf(n) =3D a(n)},

The package is :

GosperSummationMethod(E, V, R, P, Q): Exports =3D=3D Impl where
    E: OrderedAbelianMonoidSup
    V: OrderedSet
    R: IntegralDomain
    P: PolynomialCategory(R, E, V)
    Q: Join(RetractableTo Fraction Integer, Field with
              (coerce: P -> %; numer : % -> P; denom : % -> P))

Then can I recognize << with my eyes >> the hypergeometric serie ?

The easiest hypergeometric serie are 0F0 (x)=3Dexp x and 1F0 (a, x)=3D(1-=
x)^(-a).

For others functions must I cut the hypergeometric serie in order to reco=
gnize
atan, exp and so. Is it possible ?=20

The main problem is perhaps to simplify (n+1)!/n!,=20
but an expand/rewrite function can do it, no ?=20

Martin, I'm sorry but I don't understand what your package do,
And I don't find your package on my silver axiom.

My aim is to force axiom to compute theses exercices about series.

Thanks a lot if you accept to drive me inside theses algorithms.

This is the most advanced summation package I ever saw, and it handles
rather difficult cases. Downside is that it is written for mathematica and
has a about 10^4 lines of code (as Schneider told me). Furthoermore, its
not literate codes and the algorithms are sparcely documented in research
papers only (if at all)....

Donno if that helps...

Yes, it is. (As part of my largest commit this week-end).

Configure detects (or can be told through --without-x) that X11 is not
available.   Consequently we don't build the X11 parts in src/
(e.g. graph, hyper).
However, I just discover that I did not commit the corresponding
part for src/lib.  Before you waste your time trying, let me correct
that part first.

the reason I chosed to use cygwin for the host and build machine is
that it provides some POSIX/Unix functionalities that I'm not sure I
have under mingw, and on the other hand I can convince GCC to generate
mingw binaries from cygwin.  It was not for the X11 stuff.

{

	n=n+1;
        j=split($0,b,"{");
        m=m+substr(b[j],1,length(b[j])-1);

but in sandbox it reads:

	n=n+1;
        j=split($0,b,"{");
        if (j >= 2)
          m=m+substr(b[2],1,length(b[2])-1);
}

i don't understand this change. 
can someone explain it?

sorry, "sandbox" is wh-sandbox in svn on sourceforge.
as near as i can determine it is a branch off build-improvements.

Gold code is wrong.  This is part of 'presea' which is is run on output
of 'hthits'.  'hthits' outputs looks like:

\newsearchresultentry{1}{Asp24 Example Code}{Asp24ExampleCode}
\newsearchresultentry{1}{Asp27 Example Code}{Asp27ExampleCode}
....


after splitting on "{" the first field is '\newsearchresultentry' and
the second is number of occurences of search term in the page.  The
test for 'j >= 2' is just to tolerate garbage.  'presea' is supposed
to count the number of matches and put it in the header for search
results.  Gold version reported no matches in the header.

You may need other fixes to actually see search results (and notice
the problem).

ah. perhaps it might be worthwhile adding this bit of wisdom to the
documentation for the change.

quite curious that this code never worked and nobody noticed.

Is that separation of X11 stuff in the current build-improvements
branch? (I could use that on some of the SourceForge compile farm
machines.)

I would think that that main reason for using cygwin would be
because you want X11 and pseudo terminals. No? But under native
Windows this separation is necessary.

Ok, lets lighten-up. I know I probably deserved that considering
my other thread. Peace. :-)

I am very happy that you are serious about building Axiom on
Windows and I will help however I can. A new version for Windows
is badly needed. Later today I will re-verify the my build of
gcl-2.6.8pre under Windows and let you know.

Building on cygwin is definitely an option if we want to get the
full functionality of Axiom as it exists on Linux, but it is
important to keep in mind that *most* Windows users are very
resistant to installing cygwin and even more negative about using
X11 applications under Windows because the look and feel is so
different. So I think we want at least AXIOMsys to run natively
without cygwin or the cygwin libraries.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Dear Francois,

unfortunately, I currently don't have the time to answer all your
questions. I'll try to answer at least the quickies:

Francois Maltey <fmaltey@nerim.fr> writes:

> Are they all hypergeometrics ?=20
> this means that u(n+1) / u(n) is an alg=C3=A9braic fraction

No. If we are talking about

sum(u(n), n =3D 1.. m),

it means that u(n+1) / u(n) is rational (i.e., a fraction of two polynomial=
s)
in n.

> Then can I recognize << with my eyes >> the hypergeometric series ?

You "only" need to check whether u(n+1) / u(n) is rational. As Waldek point=
ed
out, this is not always possible. You have to stay in "computable" domains,
i.e., domains where you can test for zero. For example, the domain of
arithmetic expressions is not computable: there cannot be an algorithm that
decides whether some expression is zero. Algebraic numbers, Polynomials ove=
r a
computable domain, polynomially recursive sequences over a computable domain
are examples of computable domains.

> Martin, I'm sorry but I don't understand what your package do,=20

It "guesses" an expression / recurrence for the n-th term of a sequence, gi=
ven
the first few terms. For example,

guess([0,1,2,3,4,5]) will answer "n".

If you happen to know that your sequence is generated by a polynomial, and =
you
have a bound for the degree, you are done: just plug in the first degree+1
values and you'll get it. In principle we can mimick Zeilbergers algorithm
(although not very efficiently) this way: compute a bound for order and deg=
ree
of your recurrence and supply enough values to guess the sequence.

> And I don't find your package on my silver axiom.

No, you have to download the packages as indicated on
MathAction/GuessingFormulas and compile them. You'll get documentation in
HyperDoc then.

at least my Axiom doesn't know to sum to infinity. I have to say

(4) -> sum (n^2 * x^n,n=3D0..m)

          2 3        2           2     2             m    2

and then I would like to say limit(%, m=3D%plusInfinity). Axiom responds wi=
th
"failed", of course, since it doesn't know that x < 1...

Sorry no graph, no explanation, only the practical approach. 

BR Gernot 


<----- begin code ------->
#include "axiom.as"
#pile 

INT ==> Integer;
NNI ==> NonNegativeInteger;
SI ==> SingleInteger;
PI ==> PositiveInteger; 

test(i: INT):INT == {
 import from INT, SI, PI, NNI; 

 -- INT -> all
 si1:SI := i::SI;
 pi1:PI := i::PI;
 nni1:NNI := i::NNI; 

 -- SI -> all
 int2:INT := si1::INT;
 pi2:PI := si1::PI;
 nni2:NNI := si1::NNI; 

 --> NNI -> all
 int3:INT := nni1::INT;
 pi3:PI := nni1::PI;
 si2:SI := nni1::SI; 

 i;
}

Great.

I did not complete my testing of a new MSYS/MinGW configuration
because I got bitten by another repository bug. I still can not
use svn (TortioseSVN) on Windows because the SourceForge site dies
with the well known read error and irrevocably locks the repository.
And I can not obtain build-improvements from Google Code because we
long ago exceeded the maximum allowed capacity of that site and it
is no longer being updated. So I opted for darcs only to discover
that at patch 150 the 'get' it dies because it says it cannot apply
the rename of SEGBIND.ps. And I haven't figured out how to stop
darcs from applying this patch. This is a new failure sense it used
to work *before* we decided to normalize the duplicate file names
to lower case. I wonder whether 'darcs get' of build-improvements
still works on MAC OSX?

Right now I am trying again using Mercurial.

Adapting gcl memory management to windows is a big problem. Mike
Thomas did most of the work to make gcl run on Windows but he
specifically did not want to work with cygwin. I am not sure that
Mike is still here on this email list... but with Camm's help we
might be able to solve this problem for cygwin.

The MSYS tools (including tar, I think) simulate symlinks via copy.
This works in most cases. In particular I am able to compile noweb
without changes.

Usually mixing cygwin and MSYS/MinGW tools is a *bad* idea because
they use quite different conventions when it comes to solving
compatibility problems with Windows.

I am surprised that bsdsignal.c compiled. I think Windows has fewer
and different signals than unix.

There is no fork() or wait() under native Windows so that was a
good place to suspend your testing. :-)

I suspect that you will find this even less likely to succeed
but I am interested in seeing how far you get.

I keep hoping that some day the Axiom project will attract
a really experienced Windows Developer...

I'm not so sure.  The combination let me move through the
shortcomings of both individual systems that popped up.  Of course,
you have to know the conventions.

sorry, this should read fnct_key.c.

Well, onece you understand what bsdSignal was supposed to implement, it
is not hard to rewrite it in a way that it "works".  As a matter of
fact, it is a straightforward variation on an example in the classical
"Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment" book by Stevens.

In particular for MSYS, bsdSinal was not (originally) supposed to do
anything terribly useful, except to systematically report an error.
Note however that MSYS has a minimal <signal.h> (old style) that could
be used. Again, this requires to abstract over the irritating testing
for platforms, when one is interested in functionbality.

A few other filess compile.  bsdsignal.c does not use fork and wait.

Most definitely, I don't want to have to switch to

I too hope -- because I have no intention to become an experienced
Windows developer (I don't have the time).

I can see how you feel that way but I'm a bit puzzled.

Didn't google give us a full gig of disk space?

I thought SVN only copies files when they are changed
so branches should not be expensive since they store 
only changes. I know that GIT only copies files when the
checksums differ so several copies of Axiom occupy almost
no additional space (or time, since GIT will not rsync
files that are duplicates). Surely Axiom will fit in a
gig of disk space.

I haven't checked darcs today but I checked out a copy of 
build-improvements today with svk on MacOS X 10.4.

svk sync mirrors the whole svn repository, but it's files are named 
after the revision numbers. I guess it will work if you don't try to 
check out a version with the name conflicts.

I think I pulled the whole axiom tree with svk:

$ svk list /mirror/axiom
branches/
silver/
tags/
trunk/

$ du -sh ~/.svk/remote
364M    /Users/humberto/.svk/remote

Hi Bill,

In google, what is trunk and what is silver??? Isn't one of them redundant?
Sorry I lost track of the new schema for the repos.

Regards,

Alfredo

That seems about right.

No. They eventually grudgingly "compromised" at 750MBMbytes.
See email from Ben Collins-Sussman below.

Yes, in theory. However when creating a mirror it seems that this
may or may not be the case. If the file systems are the same then
one can just rsync the files and the result is identical but
according to Ben, the version of SVN at Google Code uses some
new and different file system so simply copying the underlying
repository files is not an option. The last email I have from him
on this issue mentioned a possible problem with space allocation
or maybe a disk usage accounting error.

Also since then we have two new branches in the SourceForge SVN
repository. Apparently creating branches via the SVK mirror and
smerge commands does *not* conserve disk space.

And another thing is that since this is a repository and all
history is kept, everything we do takes more space. For example
each new version of gcl-2.6.8pre.tgz that we commit to the SVN
repository adds another 50 Mbytes since no attempt is made to do
binary diffs. (I think there are already 4 versions of gcl in the
build-improvements branch.)

"GIT only copies files when the checksums differ". Are you sure?
Are checksums that reliable? Can you give me a reference? But I
agree that GIT uses significantly less space than SVN (and Mercurial
uses even less).

'silver' is supposed to be an exact mirror of Tim's axiom--silver--1
repository.

'trunk' is the original trunk from the SourceForge SVN which was
copied from patch-50 with a few updates that were applied directly
to SVN but not backported to axiom--silver--1.

After the recent dispute over managing these repositories, I am
not certain of the status of these on SourceForge. The last
comment I recall from Tim was that he was bringing axiom-silver--1
up-to-date (and thus also 'silver' SVN at SourceForge because
there is a robot process that mirrors his changes) and that he
now considered 'silver' also up-to-date, so yes probably 'trunk'
is now redundant.

But because of the space problems on Google I am not certain that
the Google versions of these are identical to the SourceForge
versions.

In short the Google repository is a mess. We should probably
wipe it and try to start again. If you are inclined to help with
this, probably the best thing would be to contact Ben and discuss
it with him. Maybe he would be willing to manually re-populate
the Google repository again.

Regards,
Bill Page.

GIT computes the MD5SUM of each file and each subdirectory and of the
whole tree. Only subtrees or files which have different MD5SUMs are
every stored, copied or transmitted. Thus creating a copy and checking
it in does almost nothing and takes almost no time to upload.

I know this works because I have switched to GIT for all of my 
personal work. Multiple copies of gcl-2.6.8pre.tgz take no additional
space or time to transmit.

Arch seems to want to trade disk space for file transfer time.
If you check out an arch repository it makes a "pristine copy"
which it caches locally, thus taking twice the disk space. The
advantage is that you don't do any network traffic for some
operations because you have a local, unchanged copy. The disadvantage
is the huge disk space cost. GIT does not store a local copy but only
has to transmit the MD5SUM of the tree root or subdirectory to decide
if changes occur. I'm not sure what SVN does.

You can see it in the numbers I just sent. Arch takes 305M, GIT takes 135M
for the same copy of Axiom.

well, we have had  many branches, some of them actually share nothing
in common (I think they must have 3 distinct copies of Axiom in the
repo), and there were lots of property changes on almost every 
file.

Indeed.  I'm of the opinion that keeping GCL as a tarball in the repo

Google shows revision 214. It looks that we exceeded Google quota by
creating 'silver'.

Ben,

We are having some problems again with our Axiom repository on
Google Code. I am copying you on the email below as background.
To make a long story short: I think we need to ask you to delete
the current repository and rebuild it again via 'svnadmin load'
as you did back on October 9 (see copy of your email below).

Since that time the size of the Axiom repository on SourceForge
has grown from 165MB to about 364M due to the creation of two
new branches. Even accounting for the larger storage factor at
Google (roughly double), I think this should still fit within
our current 750MB quota.

If you have any questions about this please ask. Also if you can
give us an update on the status of the problem which you mentioned
in October 9 message, that would be great.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yes, I think that is correct. Here is my attempt at post mortem:

Up to revision 199 (October 26), the 'svk smerge' transactions from
the axiom-developer.org server that are intended to synchronize the
Google repository with the SourceForge repository were properly
processed by Google. For reasons that I don't understand, the svk
smerge process did not automatically create the correct branch
structure at Google when we created 'silver' on SVN SourceForge.

Revision 214 on Google was the last of several transactions starting
with Revision 200 (including some errors) which I submitted to try
to create /silver with has the same structure as on SourceForge.
I ran a separate svk smerge job to try to transfer the contents
of 'silver' from SourceForge to Google. Revisions 200-210 appeared
to work but still resulted in wrong name and structure due to my
errors. Revision 210 was dated Sat Oct 28 03:44:24 2006.

After that I received notices each day from my svk smerge job on
the axiom-developer.org server showing that the storage quota was
exceeded on Google.

On November 15 I submitted 4 more revisons 211 to 214 which corrected
my errors by renaming and deleting unused branches. But this did not
have any positive effect at Google. Update transactions are still
not be processed.

Now I no longer even get any commit messages from Google at all
although the svk smerge job is still running each night and shows
that the local Google mirror on axiom-developer.org is being updated
successfully. It is not clear to me why I no longer seeing commit
attempts - either Google is not processing them or 'svk sync' is no
longer sending them. I have even recreated the svk google mirror
repository on axiom-developer in an attempt to re-synch. This worked
as expected but still no commit transactions seem to be attempted
at Google.

------

So I think the problems definitely were caused by the creation of
'silver'. But because we only have svn commit access to Google and
no svnadmin privileges, it seems impossible to be to correct this
problem without the intervention of people at Google.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yep, that would explain it.  Branches are supposed to be cheap copies;
 they're just a hardlink within the repository, so they're nearly
instantaneous to create and take essentially zero space when they're
first made.  I don't know what you did on sourceforge, but it sure
wasn't a normal subversion branch!

I can reset the google repository to revision 0 if you'd like.

That would be very much appreciated.

Bill, before your mirror to the next new repo, please let me make sure
that we don't store gcl and noweb as .tar.gz anymore.

I don't understand "repository within repository" comment but
yes I agree that the large increase in size in not unexpected.
In fact we discussed exactly this before the creation of 'silver'
back in October. Do you recall our discuss of the consequences
of having two roots in the repository?

For me, the mystery is why 'svk smerge' did not successfully
mirror our creation of this new branch.

No it was not a normal subversion branch. Our problem has a long
history connected with different major Axiom developers using
different source code repository systems (arch, cvs and svn).
The original trunk in svn at SourceForge was created by the
SourceForge tool for converting cvs to svn. The contents of cvs
at SourceForge was obtained from a series of snapshots from the
arch master repository. Because of improperly flagged binary
files, the resulting svn repository was a bit of mess but that
was eventually corrected.

Meanwhile for a variety of reasons development continued on both
arch and svn independently with commits to both svn trunk and to
several svn branches as well as the original arch "silver". In
October we decided to try to merge the changes to svn trunk and
arch silver. My proposal was to automatically mirror the arch
silver repository as a new "trunk" on svn so that both sets of
developers could continue using their own repository systems.
This resulted in the duplication of files mentioned by Gaby.

To understand my motivation it is important to note that the svn
mirror of the silver repository contains the history of the
development in arch. While the existing trunk contains only the
snapshot history from cvs.

In mean time, we also implemented an automatic mirror process
that is supposed to keep the Axiom Google Code repository in
sync with the SourceForge repository. I guess in retrospect
creating 'silver' at SourceForge after implemented the automatic
mirror was a bad idea given that we are so severely limited in
disk quota at Google.

What I would really like to be able to do is "re-base" all of
the existing branches on svn on this new 'silver' so that they
are deltas of it instead of trunk. Then commits to the arch
silver master would still be properly reflected at SourceForge
and Google. But maybe this is a vane hope. And maybe the long
term continued use of arch is in doubt anyway.

To move forward, I think what we probably need to do is to replace
the trunk at SourceForge with the current contents of 'silver' at
SourceForge. I.e. compute the minimum delta from trunk to silver
and then apply it to trunk. And then scrap all of the history
related to 'silver' even though 'silver' actually has the more
complete history. I think we *might* be able to do this via
svnadmin at SourceForge... but I really need the help of someone
more knowledgeable than me in order to avoid yet another disk
space catastrophe.

>=20

You may recall that more than this was necessary since the way
the svk smerge mirror synchronization process works it seems to
result in much greater disk space ussage then just 'svnadmin load'.
So just reseting it to 0 may not be enough. We went around this
problem several times before until you decided to use svnadmin.

Yes, we discussed this previously and I had agreed to commit a
change so that both gcl and noweb appear as source in a new 'tools'
directory. I am sorry that I have not yet had time to do this.
I now think we should do this at the same time as merging silver
and trunk so that we can completely get rid of the zips directory.

But of course this is not the real cause of the disk space problems
which is really the duplication that you identified in your previous
message - it just makes it a bit worse.

So as a first step I will temporarily disable the cron job that runs
the 'svk smerge' to Google. Ok?

But I am still concerned that even after we get things cleaned up
in the SourceForge SVN, then we should not depend on 'svk smerge'
to initially re-populate the repository at Google since that is
likely to cause excessive disk space utilization again. However
I think that once populated via 'svnadmin load', using svk smerge
is probably ok provided I don't decide to do something stupid again...

Regards,
Bill Page.

I would think so; but I would very much welcome Ben's input here about
the best way to avoid the duplicate trees (maybe keep history only
after the repopulation?)

After reading the history of your project.... cvs, svn, svk, arch....
my head is truly spinning!

I hate to say this, but I think it's time to stop trying to use
multiple version control systems and multiple hosting services.  If I
were running your project, I'd just 'stop the madness' and start
fresh.   Completely start over.   By that, I mean:

  1. choose ONE hosting service
  2. choose ONE version control system
  3. import just the LATEST trunk code into that system (no history!)

Start coding against your latest codebase.   If for some reason you
need to access history (look at an old branch or tag, or diff against
an old file), then dig out the older version control system and peer
into it.

Shocking statement:  you really don't need your code history as much
as you think you do.  In the scenario I'm advocating, your history
isn't even gone, it's just not super-convenient to access.  Weigh that
slight inconvenience against the *monstrous* headaches you guys have
been going through trying to get svn/svk/arch to work together and
sync around.  Your version control tool is supposed to be helpful for
collaboration and stay out of the way of your work.  From where I'm
sitting, it seems like your project is spending 80% of its energy just
trying to battle various SCM tools.  Enough is enough!  Choose one,
start fresh, move on!

(Case study:  Subversion itself was initially developed in CVS for
more than a year.  When it came time to become 'self-hosting', we
hadn't yet developed the cvs2svn history-conversion tool, and we
started freaking out about not taking our code history with us into
the new system.  In the end, we just didn't bother.  It turns out it
just didn't matter;  we never *once* had to go back and grab anything
from the old CVS repository... thought it was nice to know it was
there if we needed to look something up.)

AFAICS the current 'silver' was created as a big hunk in revision
208.  Revisions 209 and 210 added a few changes (there are a few
other patches, but they reflect changes after cloning form arch)
-- I would not call this "history".  Certainly 'trunk' contains
more information.

I tried to check where disk space go.  After looking at rsynced copy
of SF repository I see that most space is taken due to following
revisions:

201   80 Mb  failed arcs clone ???
208   80 Mb  current 'silver'
252
219
143
115
102
31    each 20Mb -- snapshots of gcl-2.6.8

I've changed the subject to better reflect the subject and
omitted Ben from the Cc: list for now since he is probably
not interested in our detailed discussions on this subject.

What I see from the commit emails are my failed attempts to
create 'silver' from revisions 205 to 215, then the real 'silver'
starting from revision 216, 217, and 218. But you are right no
history! :-( I suppose this must be because of the way that Tim
created axiom--silver--1 branch in arch. I had incorrectly assumed
that axiom--silver--1 had the same history as axiom--main--1 (gold)
but never checked until now. That is another mistake I made. Of
course if we had the real history from axiom--main--1 it would
contain at least 50 entrys - one for each patch set.

Now I am inclined to agree with Ben's recommendations in his last
email. I guess we can forget this history. Tim obviously didn't
think it was important anyway. But if we do move entirely from
SourceForge to Google Code are we really prepared to forget our
current history in SVN?

>From my point of view the move to Google Code is motivated because
of extreme problems I continue to have trying to use SVN at
SourceForge. I am still optimistic that things might be easier
at Google Code. Tim had a similar experience. Are we the only
exceptions or do other people have similar problems?

How can we agree on a single host and a single repository system?

200-201 and 205-212 where both failed attempts. (I kept getting the
name wrong in the Tailor configuration file.) I finally got it right
in 213-218. Perhaps there are in fact 3 copies of the arch clone?
Or did I somehow manage to rename one and re-use it?

How can I clean-up such mistakes without leaving this mess in the
repository?

Do you know the best way of merging 'silver' into 'trunk'? I think
you once compared these versions and said there was really very
little difference. Right?

Are we prepared to cut the automatic connection with Tim's original
axiom--silver--1? I believe Tim stated that he was no longer prepared
to maintain this branch anyway. So I assume "yes".

By 252 to 31 do you mean there are 6 copies of the gcl-2.6.8pre
tarball? I.e. 6 x 20 Mb =3D 120 Mb.

Bill Page.

I can understand that.  Axiom is probably the only project I've worked on
that has more SCM than active developers :-/ 
(But, hey, I was the one who cannot work with arch; and we needed
something that can handle changeset, so CVS was no option).

Thanks!

diff compares files, not history or ancestry. 
merge likes to have ancestry, so if you're doing star-merge and the
branches don't have common ancestry, typically SVK/SVK will first
delete then add (which you may think is silly but without ancestry,
that is a reasonable thing to do).  That has the effect of
"duplicating" files.

Hi Bill,

I wonder if the content of
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxDoyen is good enough to
substitute http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomBinaries after you
created the table similar to what Tim proposed. Maybe also keep the
current AxiomBinaries as AxiomBinariesOld for the user comments it
contains.

Regards,

Alfredo

I do not know how to clean SourceForge: it seems that their policy
forbids really deleting thing, so cleanup maybe impossible without
staff help.  OTOH svn allow you to retrive changesets, so it should
be possible just to "replay" reasonable changes and create a new
somewhat clean repository -- but still containing all gcl madness
(and a lot of other trash).

I am affraid that the best thing we can do on SourceForge is to
update 'trunk' and delete 'silver'.

Yes. I would retrive changesets from 'silver' and apply them to 'trunk'.
Then I would delete 'silver'.  If you guys think that this is a good idea
I can do this.

Reasonable thing to do?  I am not sure (GITs pack command factors files
into deltas even if they do not have common ancestry).  But what you
wrote seem to explain part of disk usage.

IIRC Tim statement was about SourceForge.  My understanding was that
he will put things in axiom--silver--1 when they are ready.

Yes.  In fact, I think that we have 10 copies (giving us 5 or 6 versions)
of the gcl-2.6.8pre: the two copies of arch (201 and 208) probably
contain 2 copies (2 different versions) of gcl-2.6.8pre each.

It seems that you did not commit your changes.  I belive that in
current sitation we should drop gcl from our repository and just
provide a script to fetch desired version form gcl repository.

I think it is time to start working on a 'dist' target for make.
I would imagine that such target should fetch dependencies and
build some files which may be problematic for users and that
pack everthing into a tarball. 

FYI I recently succesfully recreated 142 viewports (all used in
HyperDoc) and almost all .pht files.  ATM recreating graphic files
requires acccess to running X server.  Also, the whole process is
somewhat fleaky, depending on little details it works or fails
-- it looks like random memory corruptions.  

Also, I have a script that recreated many of book images.

Some comments:

1) The table looks really bad in Lynx (all tables look bad in Lynx,
but this one is worse then average).

2) The page seen to equate "Linux" with "i386 Linux".  I think we
should make clear an which architecture given tarball works. Significant
fraction of Linux users are on 64-bit systems and may prefer 64-bit
binaries.  Also, it seems that Debian (and only Debian) has binaries for
architectures different than i386 and amd64, but the page completly
missess such information.

3) The page mention setting multiple enviroment variables.  IMHO such
settings should be part of wrapper script (automatically updated at
installation time).  Of course, this is really fault of given tarball...

Here is a reference:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)

Mercurial is very similar:

http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/Design

except it also uses checksums to encode the object history.

Actually SHA-1 hashes, not MD5, but the same principle applies.

>=20

The multiple copies of gcl-2.6.8pre that we have been talking
about are nearly all slightly different pre-release versions. The
hash algorithm will ensure that each of these is treated as a new
and separate file, except for the extent to which GIT and Mercurial
can compute an efficient binary diff.

???

I don't think that is correct in most cases. Check the contents of
the .git directory in your local repository. Most of the space is
in .git/objects where the files and deltas are stored based on their
hash keys (as you said earlier).

GIT and Mercurial are distributed source code control systems so
they must necessarily distribute the data. In contrast SVN and CVS
require a centralized repository.

> I'm not sure what SVN does.

SVN also stores a local copy of the repository. SVK uses this to
allow distributed source code control.

>=20

You are right that GIT and Mercurial repositories take about 1/2
the space of equivalent Arch and SVN repositories. Darcs is usually
intermediate between these two extremes.

In the context of a system based on file ancestry, yes.

no, but after an hour, SVN said:

when in fact my tree is up-to-date.  I'll merge bits and pieces.

Nothing strange.  Axiom contains a lot of unfinished code (or even
pure junk) and this is one more such piece.  I would not say that
nobody noticed -- my experience tells me that most users do not
bother reporting bugs.  Typical reaction is "X is junk" or "if I do
this in a such way then X works" (where "X" is a program).  Only
rare folks report bugs but it is easy to discourage them. In particular
you lose reporters when there is no reaction to bug reports or if bug
are not fixed for long time.  I must say that IssueTracker paints
a very bad picture of Axiom: numerous old unfixed bugs, many without
any usefull comment.

I forgot to add this, maybe because I did not see 64bit binaries in the old

Do you mean by using apt-get?

Would this be corrected when the new build procedure is done?

Dear Camm, thank you very much for looking into this.
vmlisp.lisp has become a kind of black hole attracting all kinds of

We will make sure that that black hole stops growing, and in

Yes, many people have suggested that it would be a good idea for Axiom
to move to ANSI semantics.

Thanks!

If you must use Lynx, then you should probably be reading the
source format of the wiki pages rather than the rendered form.
Try

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxDoyen/src

But I think it is unrealistic to design a web site to support
a text-only browser.

> :-) . I need input from Bill, maybe is the DHTML.

No, I am sure that Lynx would just ignore the javascript, but there
is nothing like that in these tables. The reStructuredText source
format of the tables is rendered as common HTML.

You need to think carefully about how to layout the information.
I would suggest replacing the Gold and Silver heading with a
hardware heading. Then put the Gold and Silver versions in two
separate tables. But maybe we are being a little two ambitious?
Who is going to generate all of these binaries and from what
version of the source? How will they be kept reasonably current?

I know people have built Axiom on both IA64 and amd64 (x86)
platforms. We were hoping that many some of them might contribute
a binary tarball for inclusion on the web site. So far, as far
as I know only Tim and I have actually uploaded binaries.
=20
> Do you mean by using apt-get?

Debian has a large compile farm which can be configured to
automatically post new binary versions from updated sources.

There of course (or soon will be) also versions of Axiom for
Solaris/sparc and OSX/PPC.

All of the binaries available now (except for Debian) have been
created by an adhoc manual process.

In a separate thread Waldek mentioned the need for a

 # make dist

script that would automatically build a complete Axiom distribution
with proper wrapper scripts and possibly also automatic installation
programs (such as the one included now with the Axiom on Windows
binary distribution.

On the contrary, I think it represents the true state of Axiom.
I am sure that it even understates the case. There are many more
bugs of course that have been found by someone but not entered in
the tracking system. I think it would not be usual for a system as
complex as Axiom to have many 1000s of reported bugs. This is
certainly the case with both Maple and Mathematica - the only
difference is that for commercial strategic reasons they do not
make this information public. But Axiom is an open source project.

The true situation is that the Axiom project is critically short
of developers. It is also short of people willing to volunteer for
testing and updating bug reports. But some bugs have been fixed
and some bugs are continuing to be reported. And we have more
Axiom developers this year than last year, so it is not as bad
as it could be.

What suggestions do you have for improving the situation?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I think so.  I can not really check this (because I do not have such
a machine) but debian mirror shows packages for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa,
i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc. Some may
be considered 'unstable' (or work with different Debian version), but
at the first glance it looks like "full coverage" (Camm probably can
give an official statement about availability).

More the moment, I'm happing to have GCL ncluded as source code.

I was thinking that maybe there should be only binaries using Gold.
What is the release time frame for Axiom? I mean with this that if it is every
6 months then at the point we create Binaries from Gold. Of course this
assumes that the work done in Silver(gold to be) and its branches will be
included in Gold.

Since you speak about this, the 'asec' function in vmlisp.lisp is
defined two times for gcl and cmucl. Kai Kaminski "literated" this file
some times ago, he probably fixed this issue.

It should be done by now.

If SF/SVN server keeps its promises, you should experiment some
failures during  the next update.  You just have be patient ans start over
again until the update is finished.  I would still appreciate if you
could wait more before starting the mirror to Google again.

You should pull the updated source from the src link here:

I'm going to suppress the Juergen Weiss's asec definition.

And just for the fun, here is its definition :

#+:(or :cmu :akcl :gcl)
(defun asec (a)
  (if (and (a > -1.0) (a < 1.0))
    0.0
    (acos (/ 1.0 a))))

And no one sees the errors :-)

in fact, this is a known bug (see src/input/Makefile.pamphlet)
and search for FLUSH.

the package, attached below, makes no reference to how it is used
but it is intended to print lines which do not contain line-feeds
thus requiring the call to flush.

the correct fix would be to add the line:

(defun flush () (force-output))

in vmlisp.lisp

I think this may be "reasonable" compromize definition for a
function with signature

  Float -> Float

Juergen recognized this pecularity.

Perhaps a better argument checking would be a good idea, but
obviously Axiom does not try to call this asec function for
real values between -1 and 1.

Well, I think that this very well illustrates problems with Axiom:
there is a known bug which hampers usage of an important package
(the REGSET package). When the bug is fixed you fuss over edge cases
in underspecified internal package.

Note that flushing output should be done when the outupt is complete,
while iprint clearly is used to compose bigger units from small parts.
But if you insist I may add a FORCE_-OUTPUT call to iprint (there is
no reason to have extra flush function).

I must confess, however, that I get very nervous when codes are deleted.
(And I do confess I delete codes too).  It is good you've looked into
that problem.  Edge cases are also part of fixing bugs, so I believe I
feel like Tim on this particular topic.

Could you write up this kind of insight in the pamphlets?  It would be
useful for some of us in the future.

Deleting the call to flush breaks the existing semantics of the package.
You are welcome to define that as "fussing over edge cases".

FLUSH was probably a function defined in CCL.

Calling FORCE_-OUTPUT is a correct change.

Alternatively you could call the function StreamFlush()$LISP
which is already defined in interp/unlisp.lisp.

Greg,

Did you verify that you can successfully build Axiom with this
modification to vmlisp.lisp.pamphlet?

Regards,
Bill Page.

It seems that you did not notice the errors, as me at first glance:

(and (a > -1.0) (a < 1.0))

This is not Lisp code :-)

This function is meant to be used only with DoubleFloat and effectively
it is called. The avantage, for me, of the other definition is that,
combined with C-TO-R, it throws a library error : "Result is not real"
and do not return 0. Of course it can be easily implemented in Spad.

For Float, Complex(Float) and Complex(DoubleFloat) the Lisp asec
function is not used. I haven't looked at this recently but I think in
these cases, the definition comes from the
ArcTrigonometricFunctionCategory category.

I have only tested a recompilation of this file, not a complete build of
Axiom. If a full recompilation of Axiom is necessary I prefer to revert
this change (I don't want to recompile Axiom just for this simple
modification).

I forgot to say that what I have removed is ununsed code since the
"missing DFLOAT functions" overwrite it. But I have to admit that I did
not test my change (recompiling vmlisp.lisp). Checked after reading your
mail.

In the build-improvements branch there still is one filename conflict on 
Mac OS X:

CHANGELOG - ChangeLog

svk didn't choke when I checked out the source, it just overwrites 
CHANGELOG with ChangeLog and then claims I modified the file.

Oh! Duh, <embarrassment> ...

So this doesn't cause an error when compiling Axiom with GCL?
Does  #+(or :cmu :akcl cause it to be excluded?

But maybe for the sake of other lisp targets rather than deleting
it, maybe re-writing it to correct the error would be better?

Anyway. No problem. You decide.

Cheers,
Bill Page.

I'm resubmitting a shorter version of a 300K patch I sent this
morning. This time I generated the patch without the diffs for configure
and a couple of Makefile.in files. I guess my version of configure is
different from Gaby's, it basically changed every line in configure.

I think I got a working build of axiom on Mac OS X 10.4 again.

http://www.hpcf.upr.edu/~humberto/axiom-macos-ppc-20061130.tar.gz

untar this somewhere, then point AXIOM at the
target/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0 directory:

$ tar zxf axiom-macos-ppc-20061130.tar.gz
$ export AXIOM=`pwd`/target/powerpc-apple-darwin8.8.0
$ PATH=$AXIOM/bin:$PATH
$ axiom

Success!

This was built from the svk mirror:

$ svk info
Checkout Path: /Users/humberto/src/axiom/build-improvements
Depot Path: /mirror/axiom/branches/build-improvements
Revision: 328
Last Changed Rev.: 327
Mirrored From: https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom, Rev. 327
Copied From: /axiom/trunk/axiom, Rev. 32
Merged From: /axiom/trunk/axiom, Rev. 32

that I checked out on Tuesday. That revision builds on Mac OS X, but
axiom won't work because sman and clef build without working pty support
(AXIOMsys does work).

I reworked Waldek's better pty patch to work with the new
config/axiom-c-macro.h file, and to check for the proper include file
for openpty, at least on Mac and linux. I don't know if ptys work on MS
Windows.

The original openpty patch is:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00236.html

My version is below.

The procedure to build this version of axiom is not too bad. Fink still
seems to cause problems if the build machinery can see it, so I delete
it from the path. One caveat is that you need latex, makeindex, and
maybe tex for the axiom build to succeed, so I install them from fink,
and link them to /usr/local/bin.


$ PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin
$ ./configure
$ make

The darn build takes like 6 hours on my dual G5 2.5 GHz Mac.

I have some doubts about the patch, since I'm not really sure how to
build configure, I'm not certain I did it right.

I don't have commit priviledges on the code base, and I don't want them
until I'm more familiar with svn/svk, so could someone else please check
in the patch?

Finally, this patch is against revision 326, because svk complains my
axiom tree isn't local when I try to revise the patch against the
current build-improvements head. I followed the svk instructions at:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSilverBranch

but svk patch complains:
  
$ svk patch --view pty-again
Target not local nor mirrored, unable to view patch.

Anyway, here's the patch:

Gaby, it seems that your change:

2006-11-19  Gabriel Dos Reis  <gdr@cs.tamu.edu>

        * Makefile.pamphlet (alql.boot): Translate with bootsys.
        * Makefile.in: Regenerate.

broke examples in Chapter 13 of Axiom book.  The patch below (applied
as version 345 in wh-sandbox) fixed the problem for me.  Some remarks:

1) AFAICS shoe requres package declaration (otherwise we end up in
default lisp package). Unfortunatly, old boot can not handle such
declaration...
2) shoe insist on rewriting 'member' to 'MEMBER'.  One can prevent
rewriting using devious construct like:

  FUNCALL(INTERN '"member",kind,'("o" "k" "c" "d" "p"))

but what I did below is simpler.  OTOH 'member' has many uses in
interpreter, so for quick translation we may need the above.

I don't understand the fine point of this modification:

The original code is tranlated as

   ;    not MEMBER(kind,'("o" "k" "c" "d" "p")) => nil

         (PROGN

             ('T (|grepConstruct| "*" (INTERN |kind|))))))))

using a list literal of strings.

The new code is translated as

   ; getBrowseDatabase(kind) ==
   ;    $includeUnexposed? : local := true
   ;    k1 := INTERN kind
   ;    not member(k1,["o", "k", "c", "d", "p"]) => nil
   ;    grepConstruct('"*", k1)

   (DEFUN |getBrowseDatabase| (|kind|)
     (PROG (|$includeUnexposed?| |k1|)
       (DECLARE (SPECIAL |$includeUnexposed?|))
       (RETURN
         (PROGN
           (SETQ |$includeUnexposed?| T)
           (SETQ |k1| (INTERN |kind|))
           (COND
             ((NULL (MEMBER |k1| (LIST '|o| '|k| '|c| '|d| '|p|))) NIL)
             ('T (|grepConstruct| "*" |k1|)))))))

using more indirections and a list of symbols with different meaning.
Could you expand on what the root problems was?

Boot rewrites 'MEMBER' to 'member'.  Shoe is rewrites 'member' to
'MEMBER'.  I wrote in other message how to call 'member' in shoe, but
that is a devious construct.

'member' user 'EQUAL' on strings.  'MEMBER' uses 'EQ', which does not
give expected effect for strings.

Tim, I just posted my build instructions on
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom

I don't know enough Mac OS to make an axiom binary that will work on
multiple OS revisions, I'm running:

Could you try 'axiom -nogr'.  Normally when viewman dies sman re-spawns
a new copy...

|

I don't think they, but I may be wrong -- I'm not a Windows developer
and I approach this whole stuff with a very engrained unix mind.

In my locat tree, I've divided the C runtime support (libspad.a) into 
five components:

   \begin{itemize}
   \item Core runtime support,
   \item interface with the operating system (filesystem, etc.),
   \item communication through sockets,
   \item user-interface through terminals, and
   \item graphics components.
   \end{itemize}

Core runtime support is hash.c and halloc.
interface with OS is anything havind to do with files, directories and
the like.
sockets is sockio-c.c
terminal-based ui is clef and sman
graphics is hyperdoc and, wel, graphics.

In my local tree it is possible to enable each individual component,
so your patch fits nicely.

| The original openpty patch is:
| 
| http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-11/msg00236.html
| 
| My version is below.

you would have gotten brownie points if you integrated


| The procedure to build this version of axiom is not too bad. Fink still
| seems to cause problems if the build machinery can see it, so I delete
| it from the path.

we can configure-detect that and set PATH accordingly.

| One caveat is that you need latex, makeindex, and

we can ask configure to return the absolute path so that there would
be no need to symlink from somewhere else.

| maybe tex for the axiom build to succeed, so I install them from fink,
| and link them to /usr/local/bin.
| 
| 
| $ PATH=/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/X11R6/bin:/usr/local/bin
| $ ./configure
| $ make
| 
| The darn build takes like 6 hours on my dual G5 2.5 GHz Mac.

:-(

| I have some doubts about the patch, since I'm not really sure how to
| build configure, I'm not certain I did it right.

I very much appreciate your effort and patience with this.

| I don't have commit priviledges on the code base, and I don't want them
| until I'm more familiar with svn/svk, so could someone else please check
| in the patch?

Yes, I would like to work a little bit on it with you.

| Finally, this patch is against revision 326, because svk complains my
| axiom tree isn't local when I try to revise the patch against the
| current build-improvements head. I followed the svk instructions at:
| 
| http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSilverBranch
| 
| but svk patch complains:
|   
| $ svk patch --view pty-again
| Target not local nor mirrored, unable to view patch.

Yes, member is a kind of library function in new Boot. Every symbol
goes through bfReName (boot/tytree1.boot).  However, you can pretend
that you have a function member that is not a library function if you
write its name as a string literal

  "member"(kind, '("o" "k" "c" "d" "p"))

which translates to

        ('|member| |kind| '("o" "k" "c" "d" "p"))

as opposed to

  "member"(kind, '("o" "k" "c" "d" "p"))

which translates to

        (MEMBER |kind| '("o" "k" "c" "d" "p"))

Boot translation is:

             ((NULL (|member| |kind| '("o" "k" "c" "d" "p"))) NIL)

My change essentially replaces '(EQUAL str1 str2)' by 
'(EQ (INTERN str1) (INTERN str2))', the second form is (probably) less
efficient but for our purpose equivalent.  In more detail: |member| uses
'EQUAL', to get equivalent effect using 'MEMBER' we replace strings
by symbols.  We need explicitly intern 'kind', but for the literal
list it is enough to change notation.

Indeed.  I have tried some other variation and did not work. So the

OK, thanks.  I would prefer we bring |member| back using the
"quotation" notation -- yes, I really need to write that primer to new
Boot -- and retain the list literal.

Thanks!

OK, I have not gotten that message yet.  But, the parts

             ((NULL (MEMBER |kind| '("o" "k" "c" "d" "p"))) NIL)

versus

             ((NULL (MEMBER |k1| (LIST '|o| '|k| '|c| '|d| '|p|))) NIL)

are still not explained to me.

Indeed.

Can you reccomend a reference on configure tricks like that? I've looked
at the info pages, but can't figure out how to do that.

The help for svk patch says:

    Suppose you mirror project foo to //mirror/foo, create a local copy o=
n
    //local/foo, and check out to ~/dev/foo. After you've done some work,=

    you type:

        svk commit -m "Add my new feature"

    to commit changes from ~/dev/foo to //local/foo. If you have commit
    access to the upstream repository, you can submit your changes direct=
ly
    like this:

        svk push //local/foo

    Sometimes, it's useful to send a patch, rather than submit changes
    directly, either because you don't have permission to commit to the
    upstream repository or because you don't think your changes are ready=

    to be committed.

    To create a patch containing the differences between //local/foo and
    //mirror/foo, use this command:

        svk push -P Foo //local/foo

But I don't have and don't know how to make the "local copy //local/foo"
corresponding to my upstream repository stored in //mirror/axiom

It's probably stuck in the mailman admindb queue. At 300K it's better to

I was thinking of AC_PATH_PROG (which we use for notangle and noweave
for example).

The online reference I liked (a long time ago) was the Autotools book,

        http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/

but it is quite out of date now.  But I seem to remember that one of
the co-authors (Ian, now at Google) said recently that he no longer
quite recommend it.  It is still useful though.
Otherwise I find the info pages quite well written.

| The help for svk patch says:
| 
|     Suppose you mirror project foo to //mirror/foo, create a local copy on
|     //local/foo, and check out to ~/dev/foo. After you've done some work,
|     you type:
| 
|         svk commit -m "Add my new feature"
| 
|     to commit changes from ~/dev/foo to //local/foo. If you have commit
|     access to the upstream repository, you can submit your changes directly
|     like this:
| 
|         svk push //local/foo
| 
|     Sometimes, it's useful to send a patch, rather than submit changes
|     directly, either because you don't have permission to commit to the
|     upstream repository or because you don't think your changes are ready
|     to be committed.
| 
|     To create a patch containing the differences between //local/foo and
|     //mirror/foo, use this command:
| 
|         svk push -P Foo //local/foo
| 
| But I don't have and don't know how to make the "local copy //local/foo"
| corresponding to my upstream repository stored in //mirror/axiom

OK, now I get it.  Thanks.  

You need to create a depotmap; call it whatever you want.  
Personally, I have several depots, one of them is /mirror
for mirroring several repos of projects I work on (GCC has a distinct
dedicated depot). Chose a directory where you want your depot to
reside.  It could be ~/.svk

   svk depotmap /mirror ~/.svk

(enter the editor, make whatever change you think is appropriate;
save; exit)

Next, you need to mirror axiom repo

   svk mirror https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom /mirror/axiom

Then, you need to synchronize that mirror

   svk sync /mirror/axiom

(that can take a while -- it mirrors the repo on your local disk.
Therefore, it is like if you were doing a checkout and SF/SVN would
give you headach; your would need to be patient).

/mirror/axiom is now your local repo.  You can check out as

  svk co /mirror/axiom/branches/build-improvements axiom.bi
  
and once you're in the working directory (axiom.bi), you can update at
any time

   svk update -s

Ah OK; there are lot of changed in Autoconf 2.60.   I did not upgrade,
partly because of GCC which is still stuck with Autoconf < 2.60.

Autoconf 2.60 is supposed to be fancier.

No, that won't work, or rather it works to check out the source, but I
can't svk patch that working directory. Those are the instructions I had
followed from the AxiomSilverBranch page on MathAction.

The svk help intro page suggests a procedure like:

    svk mirror

      First, you'll need to mirror a remote repository. This sets up a
      local copy of that repository for you to branch from, merge to and
      otherwise poke at. The local path is sometimes called a "depot path=
=2E"

          # This command sets up the mirror directory for your local
          # mirrors of remote repositories
          svk mkdir //mirror

          svk mirror svn://svn.example.com/project_x //mirror/project_x

    svk sync

      When you've set up a new mirror or want to get some work done witho=
ut
      a network connection, sync your local repository with upstream
      repositories.

          svk sync //mirror/project_x

    svk copy

      After that, it's easy to copy remote branches to create local
      branches. (svk branches are simply directories, just like Subversio=
n
      branches.)

          # This command sets up a directory for your local branches.
          # Local branches can't live inside mirrored paths
          svk mkdir //local

          svk copy //mirror/project_x //local/project_x

    svk checkout

      When you want to get some work done, you can checkout a working cop=
y
      to make local changes.

          cd ~/svk-checkouts
          svk co //local/project_x

Thus, I'd end up with //mirror/axiom and //local/axiom. Presumably then
svk will allow me to patch.

What I'm trying now is to make a svk copy of
/mirror/axiom/branches/build-improvements to /mirror/local to see if the
patch commands work. Stay tuned.

This is a design flaw in sman and friends -- I came across it yesterday
and thought "wait, this is an unbounded replication; nobody wants

?

The above is what *I* _use_ to set up a repo directly "connected" to 
the master repo, in particular one for Axiom.

| Those are the instructions I had
| followed from the AxiomSilverBranch page on MathAction.
| 
| The svk help intro page suggests a procedure like:
| 
|     svk mirror
| 
|       First, you'll need to mirror a remote repository. This sets up a
|       local copy of that repository for you to branch from, merge to and
|       otherwise poke at. The local path is sometimes called a "depot path."
| 
|           # This command sets up the mirror directory for your local
|           # mirrors of remote repositories
|           svk mkdir //mirror

This creates a local branch in your default depot, so it effectively
is "deconnected" from the Axiom repo.  Is that what you want?

Did you test it?

My build says fails with:

   Compiling alql.clisp.

   No FASL generated.
   NIL

I'll look into this later.
