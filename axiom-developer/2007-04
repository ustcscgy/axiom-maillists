These two domains serve two entirely different purposes, and I would warn you
not to abuse INFORM, since the idea behind it is very clever indeed, and I
definitively will use it in the future.

I'm glad you asked. :-)

I presume that by "Expression T" you mean such domains as
'Expression Integer' and 'Expression Float' etc.

For me to answer your question it is important to understand
what Expression in Axiom really is. One way to do that is to
look at the internal representation.

  Rep:=Fraction SparseMultivariatePolynomial(T, Kernel %)

So Expression is a mathematical domain of rational functions
(ratio of two polymonials) where the polynomial variables
are extended to kernels including various special functions.
It is of course a very general so many symbolic expressions
can be evaluated as operations on members of this domain.
But the members of this domain are *not* general symbolic
expressions! They are quite literally things represented as
the ratio of two polynomials, which in turn are represented
by however ratios and polynomials are represented, etc. And
the OutputForm for the members of this domain correspond to
a much reduced set of symbolic expressions.

That is the reason why when you enter something like this:

(1) -> 1/sin(x)+y

Axiom responds with:

        y sin(x) + 1
   (1)  ------------
           sin(x)
                                 Type: Expression Integer

Even though perhaps it looks like it, Axiom is not performing
some kind of arbitrary "simplification" of symbolic expressions.
Instead what is happening is that Axiom is interpreting the
symbols in the input expression as operations performed in
some domain and evaluating those operations *algebraically*
to ultimately create a member of that domain - in this case
Expression Integer. Then the Axiom interpreter displays this
member using the coercion to OutputForm defined by the
domain.

In contrast the members of the domain InputForm represent
exactly the symbolic expression that is the *input* to the
interpreter. Manipulating members of this domain amounts to
directly manipulating the expressions.

Regards,
Bill Page

What do you mean by "abuse" it? Certainly we use it all the

Sorry, I don't think I'm satisfied with an answer that has to
look at the internal representation before explaining why I
should not believe the interface.

Hello,

Let P in Ring[X] and M in SquareMatrix(Ring)

The mathematics evaluate P(M) 
   by sum (ak*M^k, k=0..deg P) in SquareMatrix(Ring)
where P = sum (ak*X^k, k=0..deg P)

How can I do this in axiom.

Maple fails in the subs command of a*M^2 + b*M + c 
because (a*M^2 + b*M) is a matrix, and c is a number.

Mupad could do it.

How can I do it with axiom ?

I have the beginning of the Caley-Hamilton theorem :
Now I must compute P(M) and find the zero matrix for n=1,2,3,4,5.

--
-- Create a generic matrix  
--

matriceN1 := n +-> _
  matrix [[("a".(i::String).(j::String))::Symbol for j in 1..n] for i in 1..n]
matriceN2 n ==
  matrix [[("a".(i::String).(j::String))::Symbol for j in 1..n] for i in 1..n]
M4 := matriceN2 4
 
--
-- Create an identity matrix 
--

(matrice N1 4)^0

zeroOrOne := b +-> if b then 1 else 0 
matriceId1 := n +-> _
  matrix [[zeroOrOne ((i=j)::Boolean) for j in 1..n] for i in 1..n]
matriceId1 4

matriceId2 := n +-> diagonalMatrix [1 for k in 1..n] 
matriceId2 5 

coeff := (i, j) +-> if i=j then 1 else 0 
matriceId3 := n +-> matrix [[coeff (i,j) for i in 1..n] for j in 1..n]
matriceId3 4 

--
-- Computes determinant (M - x*Id) where M is the previous generic matrix
--

polCar := M +-> determinant (M - x * matriceId2 ncols M)
polCarN := n +-> polCar matriceN1 n
polCarN 2
P4 := polCarN 4

--
-- Now evaluate P4(M4). We might find the (0)_4 matrix.

Of course you should believe the interface! There is no need to
look at the internal representation. I just thought it might be
easier since we are developers and are able to take a "white box"
view. But if you prefer that I express this only in terms of the
interface, please review the following Axiom session.

Consider the three strings:

(1) ->   a1:="(a/x)+(a/y)"

   (1)  "(a/x)+(a/y)"
                                                     Type: String

(2) ->   a2:="(a/x) + (a/y)"

   (2)  "(a/x) + (a/y)"
                                                     Type: String

(3) ->   a3:="(a*x+a*y)/(x*y)"

   (3)  "(a*x+a*y)/(x*y)"
                                                     Type: String

Of course as members of the Domain String these are all different.

(4) -> (a1=a2)::Boolean

   (4)  false
                                                     Type: Boolean

(5) -> (a1=a3)::Boolean

   (5)  false
                                                     Type: Boolean

(6) -> (a2=a3)::Boolean

   (6)  false
                                                     Type: Boolean

While as members of the Domain Expression Integer these are equal.

(7) -> interpretString(a1."=".a2)::Boolean

   (7)  true
                                                     Type: Boolean

(8) -> interpretString(a1."=".a3)::Boolean

   (8)  true
                                                     Type: Boolean

(9) -> interpretString(a2."=".a3)::Boolean

   (9)  true
                                                     Type: Boolean

But when we evaluate them as symbolic expressions in the domain
InputForm:

(10) -> x:INFORM:=x

   (10)  x
                                                   Type: InputForm

(11) -> y:INFORM:=y

   (11)  y
                                                   Type: InputForm

(12) -> a:INFORM:=a

   (12)  a
                                                   Type: InputForm

The first two are equal but the third is something different!

(13) -> interpretString(a1."=".a2)::Boolean

   (13)  true
                                                     Type: Boolean

(14) -> interpretString(a1."=".a3)::Boolean

   (14)  false
                                                     Type: Boolean

(15) -> interpretString(a2."=".a3)::Boolean

   (15)  false
                                                     Type: Boolean

So equality of these "algebraic" objects in Expression Integer
is not the same as equality in a purely symbolic domain like
InputForm.

In fact, after completing this exercise I realized that the
original Axiom developers actually did already anticipate the
need for an OutputForm for InputForm that is equivalent the
actual input to the Axiom interpreter. The function that I was
looking for is called 'expr' in the domain InputForm.

(16) -> map(expr,map(interpretString,a1=a2)::Equation(INFORM))

         a   a  a   a
   (16)  - + -= - + -
         x   y  x   y
                                      Type: Equation OutputForm

(17) -> map(expr,map(interpretString,a2=a3)::Equation(INFORM))

         a   a  a x + a y
   (17)  - + -= ---------
         x   y     x y
                                      Type: Equation OutputForm

(18) -> map(expr,map(interpretString,a1=a3)::Equation(INFORM))

         a   a  a x + a y
   (18)  - + -= ---------
         x   y     x y
                                      Type: Equation OutputForm

So once again as Tim Daly has said main times, the problem is
just that :( as usual ): there is not enough documentation.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I very much prefer an answer in terms of interfaces than that of
internal representation (where possible).  Because interfaces are what
explains the thingies to us -- even as developers.

I regret to say, but I'm a big fan of encapsulation (where useful) and
prefer to see interfaces even if I'm spending all my time tweaking in
the innards.  Thanks for the illustation. 

The difference, as I see it comes from the larger number of supported
mathematical operations for Expression T, than there are for InputForm.
Augment InputForm with all useful mathematical operations working on
InputForm and you'll see very little difference from Expression T.
Hence, Martin's warning.

Also, be aware than the Axiom designers, in many places, thought of
Expression as the general domain for symbolic manipulation and have
appropriate hardwired type inference rules in the interpreter.

Bill,

Sweet! Nice hack using InputForm.
I'll make this example into an input file for regression

As part of the effort to build a regression test suite
I've been rewriting the input files into pamphlet format.

I also picked up a book this yesterday to update my understanding
of limits and to get some idea of the range of limits that axiom
can and cannot do currently (as part of looking at the Gruntz 
limit algorithm). I've been writing these examples into input files
so we can capture the results permanently. 

It would be great if everyone could capture their testing examples
with an explanation.  The current input files are fairly sparse in
their text but they do show some interesting tricks I'd forgotten
Axiom can do.

Bill,

A slightly higher level of design goal can be seen in the ffrac.spad
domain that I just sent out. You'll notice that it has unit tests
embedded before each operation. These will serve a couple purposes,
both unit test and regression tests. That way we can document what
works and we can check when something breaks.

Of course, the inline comments are not really the "right" way
to construct and document these tests. They will eventually be
extractable chunks so we can run unit and regression tests on them.

It would be useful when constructing new domains if examples of
operations were embedded in the pamphlet files in a standard style
so we could achieve these goals.

Tim

although Domains may be mutable in some sense in SPAD and Aldor (since we can
access and modify their "state") I think that "the way things are meant to be
done in Axiom/SPAD/Aldor" is to create new domains, instead of modifying old
ones. Since we have "dependent types", this can be done in an extremely
flexible manner, as the example "Interpret" shows, which takes a string and
yields a domain.

Bill,

At an even higher level of design goal it would be useful to construct
a Computer Algebra Test Suite, a project I've referred to as CATS.

There are several converging ideas driving CATS.

First, there are very few people in the field and it would be good to
leverage expertise across more than one CAS. This is probably of more
interest to the SAGE people but Axiom can be a driving force.

Second, there is a NIST classification system for numeric algorithms.
Such a standard does not exist for algebraic algorithms. But it would
be useful to have a classification so we could show which parts of the
standard Axiom currently computes and which parts need work.

Third, there needs to be some way to organize the documentation
within Axiom so that it follows some kind of logical outline.
One possibility is to follow book outlines for particular domains
but Axiom covers a large range which isn't found in any one book.

Fourth, we've tried to organize the algebra graph within Axiom
without success. I think there is a lot to learn about both Axiom's
algebra graph and computational mathematics from a good organization.

So the CATS effort is an attempt to drag these observations into one
pile and create a first draft of a "standard" computational mathematics
layout. This would allow us to place algorithms in context, place 
carefully audited, universally accepted results in context, standardize
the abilities expected in CA systems, document algorithms and results
in some standardized format, organize research tracks, etc.

This might end up being in a Abramowitz and Stegun style, like
their Handbook of Mathematical Functions, crossed with books like
Geddes. (It's unfortunate that copyright will keep these prior works
from being directly useful.)

The job is large but the 30 year horizon benefits are enormous.




Within the Axiom project we could start almost anywhere by just
dragging topics together at random and then classifying categories,
domains, algorithms, and example files against this arbitrary
set. Eventually I expect that the topics will self-organize (not
likely as a hierarchy but more as a graph).

This project overlays all of the computational mathematics field
so no one vendor will take it on as a project. It properly belongs
in NIST, INRIA, or some other country-wide funding organization but
I'm not optimistic about that happening.

Anyway, that's enough hasty-generalization...back to regression testing.

Tim

There are *no* mathematical (algebraic) operations in InputForm!
That is the whole point of the discussion.

That is completely wrong. There is still a huge difference
as I have now explained at least two different ways. :-(
The operations in InputForm are purely symbolic. They could
be written in simple Lisp or Python just as easily. That is
definitely not true of Expression. Expression requires a very
large portion of Axiom's library.

I do not understand Martin's warning. I think it under the

Of course that is no problem. If you are able to read and
understand Stephen Watt's paper on this subject, I am sure
that this would be clear to you.

and I'm saying that once you've added them, as for Expression T,
you'll see no difference.  Adding them is precisely what people do
when they start "symbolic computation" and "simplification".

That has nothing to do with what I'm saying. 

BTW, it is possible to read Watt's paper and not agreeing with him.
And it is possible to agree with him and not reading his paper.
But again, what he said in his paper has nothing to do with the
distinction between Expression T and InputForm I'm concerned with.

Tim, what about using MSC2000 as a top level starting point for the
algebra portion of the classification?  Even that is probably not of
sufficiently broad scope (many pamphlets in Axiom will be related to
more mundane issues such as programming language definition, user
interface APIs, etc) but for mathematics I doubt it would be possible to
find something more useful.

A while back I did some work with the MSC2000 system in order to design
a top level bibliography system for Axiom, and actually did get
something working.  I don't think there was much response to the
original effort and I didn't pursue it further, but I believe the code
is still available.

Is that subject classification not quite what is needed for this effort?
 If not, perhaps something could be begun based on category theory?

Cheers,
CY

No. I disagree at a deep level. I think what is done in the
Axiom library is completely different. What Axiom is doing is
fundamentally *algebraic*. Simplification of symbolic expressions
does not any algebra. For example to simplify an expression it
is not necessary to instantiate an object which directly represents
a polynomial in the way polynomials are represented in Axiom.
All that you need to do is to apply a set of re-write rules that
accomplish (or not) your desired goal.

On the other hand creating a polynomial *object* (and some other
algebraic objects) is exactly what Axiom does in the Expression
domain.

Certainly. In fact I agreed with him before I read his paper.

It is possible that I do not understand "the distinction between
Expression T and InputForm that you are concerned with", but I
did think that my concern in this regard was the same as yours.
If that is the case then I strongly disagree with your conclusion.
I also feel strongly that understanding this distinction is
critical to understanding what is different about Axiom as a
computer algebra system, so I have a lot of motivation to continue
this discussion until we can find some agreement.

How shall we proceed?

Would it help if I try to described more formally my understanding
of exactly how Axiom captures matematical semantics in terms of
the representation of objects and how that differs from more
syntactical things like term re-writing? Or do continue to insist
that we not talk about representation?

Regards,
Bill Page.

Well, I do disagree there.  If you don't do any algebra, you cannot
manage your symbolic expressions. 

For a symbolic expression, you first need to chose on a "standard form"
(or "normal form", depending on your religion).

The fundamental reason why "simplify" is so ill-defined for symbolic
expressions is precisely that whatever they have to do is profoundly
influenced by the algebra of the standard form structures.


For example, when you see something like

     x^2 * 3 * x^(-4) * 5/89

you have to come up with algebraic computations for the "constant"
parts, and for the exponent parts -- many symbolic manipulation
systems assume tht "*" is commutative.

| For example to simplify an expression it

But, you do need to come up with standard form that requires you do
define algebra rules on the objects.  In particular, you do need to
make alegbraic assumptions regarding the polynomials.

| All that you need to do is to apply a set of re-write rules that
| accomplish (or not) your desired goal.

But, the rewrite rules do embody algebraic semantics.

        simplify(differentiate (sin(x) + x, x)^2 + (sin(x) + x)^2)

"that is exactly" what?

I believe I understand what makes the difference between Axiom and
other CASes, but I think both you and me seem to profoundly between
the outcome of InputForm augmented with all that is necessary to mimic
other CASes and Expression T.  Consequently I do not see the link

 # understanding this distinction is critical to understanding what is

| How shall we proceed?

Definitely.

| syntactical things like term re-writing? Or do continue to insist
| that we not talk about representation?

I believe the distinction must be explained through interfaces.  If we
must resort to internal representations, then the distinction is
artificial, not fundamental; therefore, we can ignore it as being
merely non-fundamental artefacts.

I'm working my way back from the latest version thru the various
versions in arch. I've come across a difference that can't be
explained by any change I've made. Can someone please test this
on their platform and send me the results?

Attached is a portion of the regression test file. It consists of
tests delimited by --S (start) and --E (end)... The --R lines show the
"expected" results, that is, the results in silver. The --G result
show what comes from gold. The embedded lines are the computed
lines. They should be identical and clearly they are not. Please let
me know what your results are so I can guess where this bug might be.

You should just be able to clip the rest of this file into an input
file, say foo.input and the start axiom and do 
 )spool result
 )read foo
 )spool 

and send me the resulting file along with some idea of what
source tree you used to build it.


Thanks
Tim

It will help me if you can say more about exactly what is being
tested.  I see DoubleFloat computations, from what I discussed two or
three days ago, the underlying representation is Lisp' long-float --
which I think is bogus.  That representation tends to differ from
platform to platform along with the accuracy.  I believe double-float
is more portable with predictable accuracy across platforms.  Also,
there are platform-dependent libm variations to factor in (plus
C compiler optimizations).  Those remarks may or may not be relevant,
but it would help me to understand yoru issue if you could elaborate a
bit.   See below, results with build-improvements, on an
i686-suse-linux.

Yes, dependent types are very important. Full support for
dependent types in the Axiom interpreter would be wonderful.

Martin, could you please find a few minutes to create a page
on the Axiom Wiki containing an example of your Interpret
code?

I'll take "hack" as a complement, but I don't think of it
as any kind of abuse of the purpose of the InputForm domain.
It seems to me that someone had exactly this use in mind when
they wrote the 'expr$InputForm' function that takes InputForm
to OutputForm in the way we expect to write the input to the
intepreter. The only think I migh have done differently is to
make this the default coercion to OuputForm rather than the
Lisp-ish notation that is currently displayed for things of
type InputForm.

Excellent. I would be great if we could find someone to
implement Gruntz in Axiom. I also tried Ondrej's limit
example on Maxima and Reduce and note that while Axiom
returnes "failed" (which is truthful but unhelpful), both
Maxima and Reduce returns incorrect results. See

It sounds very similar to the way the Sage developers embed
regression "doc tests" into their code. I think it is an
excellent idea.

Yes! We should have a standardized way to 'notangle' and
execute the tests in every pamphlet file. I think this
could be easily done with the existing noweb and makefile
methods. All we need is for someone to define the standard
style for writing these code chunks in pamphlet files.

I nominate you. :-)

Ok, the problem isn't in axiom and it appears that it isn't in GCL.
I built the same GCL sources (no axiom) on redhat 9 and fedora 5.
The result of

(cos (acos 0.7)) on Redhat is 0.69999999999....96
(cos (acos 0.7)) on Fedora is 0.70000000000...07

so the problem change is likely somewhere in a system library
that gets linked into GCL. Since every other combination of
sins, cos, logs, exps, etc ends up with 0.69999.... I have
to conclude that there is a very minor bug in the Fedora lib.

Anybody happen to know in which system library cos/acos lives?

I agree the ideas convince me that the idea is a good one.
But I have some doubts that we have any sufficiently mature
technology that could implement this on a large scale.

I think it is definitely too large for "one book". In fact
printed books are probably not a very good model for this.
It would be much better to think in terms of something like
Wikipedia as a model. Access and navigation has to be online
and collaborative. But that requires a large and willing group
of users and as far as Axiom goes, therein lies the problem.

Probably but I think this requires considerable research.
Lately I am becoming a fan of a much less structured way of
organizing information called "tagging". Perhaps you are
familiar with the web site:

http://del.icio.us

This a large collaborative system for tagging and sharing of
web browser bookmarks. There are several papers written about
this approach as an alternative to traditional classification
schemes. The idea basically is that if this system attracks
a sufficiently large number of users, then the classification
of everything on the web becomes self-organizing and it is
claimed that it will quickly approach the accuracy of manual
classification systems. I think that this is still quite
experimental but already there are some signs that it may
eventually rival Google in terms of the relevance of search
results (which I suppose it not saying much is it? :-)

Anyway, I think a "tagging" approach might be useful when
thinking about classifying the mathematics in Axiom.

Yes, I think that is more or less the idea of "tagging" that
I mentioned above. But successful tagging probably requires
quite a large group of users.

I think Gaby has a point. Isn't this difference within the
accuracy expected for the representation used by Axiom?

Perhaps this demonstrates a potential problem for regression
tests that are based only on text file diffs. In many cases
it would be better to write specific comparison test code
in Axiom itself that would compare the result to the expected
values using methods appropriate to the domain.

C mathematical functions are part of the C standard library.  Some
systems put them in a separate library libm.{a,so} -- GNU/Linux sytems
come with glibc.  Other systems don't make a dictintion -- because the
C standard does not make one.

Furthermore, as I dicussed a few days ago, you're going to be at the
mercy of systems if you insist on using 'long-float -- it is not
always efficient and you can't predice the accuracy across platforms.
Use 'double-float.

We need to define exactly what we mean by "algebra". I think
your definition is probably much more general then mine. What
I mean very specifically would probably normally be called
abstract algebraic data types - objects that obey a specific
set of axioms and which necessarily have some (normally hidden)
internal representation. The fact that a representation exists
is the essential part, not the specific details of that
representation. The representation takes something that is
"free" over some syntactically defined set of expressiones
and maps them into some other domain (Rep).

  Interpret: Expressions --> Rep

Formally % is the image of Expression in Rep. Looking at
Interpret in reverse as "fibre bundles" is what makes this
"algebraic".

In Axiom's case coercion of % to OutputForm defines a
distinguished section of the representation bundle. I think
that (roughly) corresponds to what you called a "standard form".
That is why expressions that are interpreted as members of a
given domain appear to be "simplified" in particular ways.
But really simplification is not the goal. The goal is an
algebraic computation.

Are you thinking of standard forms as representatives of
some equivalence class of expressions? If so, then I think
maybe we agree but are just using different words.

In Axiom what we say is that we have a problem of assigning
functions to all of the operators in this expression. We do
this by either explicitly, or in various implicit ways,
specify the domains involved. Coercions to these domains
are performed as required and we actually mechanically
compute a result by applying the interpretation via the
interface provided with each domain. The final result is
a member of some domain. Finally a coercion of this member
to the OutputForm domain is displayed to the user.

Is that what you mean by "algebraic computations"?

I would like to understand better how standard forms define
algebraic rules. Can you give an example or suggest an
appropriate reference?

That is not clear to me. I am not exactly sure here what you

What is this example intended to show?

(1) -> sin(x) + x

   (1)  sin(x) + x
                                      Type: Expression Integer

(2) -> differentiate(%,x)

   (2)  cos(x) + 1
                                      Type: Expression Integer

(3) -> %^2

              2
   (3)  cos(x)  + 2cos(x) + 1
                                       Type: Expression Integer

(4) -> %+(sin(x)+x)^2

              2                     2              2
   (4)  sin(x)  + 2x sin(x) + cos(x)  + 2cos(x) + x  + 1
                                        Type: Expression Integer

(5) -> simplify %

                               2
   (6)  2x sin(x) + 2cos(x) + x  + 2
                                        Type: Expression Integer

(7) -> kernels %

   (7)  [sin(x),cos(x),x]
                             Type: List Kernel Expression Integer

Yes the internal representation of

  sin(x)+x

and the things which we derive from it are all

  Fraction SparseMultivariatePolynomial(Integer,Kernel %)

I would like to say explicitly what this difference is for you.
Would you agree that other CASes do not do computer algebra
the sense that I described above but that Axiom does work this
way?

That was *not* my intention in the email that started this
thread. What I said was that I thought InputForm was an
appropriate domain in which to represent symbolic manipulation
of expressions and what I thought was lacking was a convenient
coercion of InputForm to OutputForm that made this more
obvious. As it turns out, InputForm does in fact export a
function which performs this conversion (expr:%->OutputForm)
but this function is not automatically involved as a coercion
by the Axiom interpreter. Instead it uses a coercion to
something that looks more like an Sexpression. I would have
preferred that Axiom use expr as the automatic coercion and
display as an SExpression-like output as a separate function.
But in any case, I now think that InputForm has all that is
needed for manipulating expression symbolically.

This is very different than suggesting that InputForm should
be modified to implement symbolically some of the algebra
that is already implemented by Expression. I never said that!

>  Consequently I do not see the link

Nor do I. I guess that is a result of some confusion over what
you thought I initial proposed. Perhaps Martin also had this
wrong impression - judging from the tone of his original
reply.

I started to do this anyway earlier in this email. I don't
think it is necessary to deal with the details of any specific
internal representation - only that this representation defines
a mapping that in turn defines the algebraic properties of the
domain.

Bill,

I don't see this email on the mailing list. I've attached the
ffrac.spad domain. It handles "formal fractions" which do not
evaluate the numerator or the denominator. Thus the formal
fraction is just a data structure except that there are 
natural coercions to the algebra and back where they make sense.

This is related to the discussion of symbolic manipulation
versus algebraic manipulation.

In particular, there are two books by Joel Cohen called
"Computer Algebra and Symbolic Computation". I've had a
discussion with Joel about his work (which he has agreed
to allow Axiom to use at will). He defines MPL, a mathematical
programming language, that basically does expression-tree 
manipulations.

I'd suggested that we could create a "Cohen Algebra" category and
domain set that would follow his MPL style quite closely. The main
thing would be to choose a common representatin (Record or List)
for all elements of the domain so they compose properly. 

The big difference in an axiom implementation would be to have
coercions (or explicit import/export) from the Cohen domains 
to algebraic domains and back where they make sense.

This would satisfy the apparent end-user need to manipulate
the expression trees.

+++
+++ If the elements of the pair have a type X which is an integral

+++ is a valid type.  A FRAC X can always be coerced to a FFRAC X.
+++ If the type of the elements is a Field, a FFRAC X can be coerced
+++ to X.
+++
+++ Formal fractions are used to return results from numerical methods
+++ which determine numerator and denominator separately, to enable
+++ users to inspect these components and recognise, for example,

Hello Tim, Gaby,

I have introduced a bug in DFLOAT when I modified the way AXIOM outputs
DoubleFloat, look at :

[...]

> 
>    (8)
>    [-1.1102230246251565E-16 + -2.2204460492503131E-16 %i,


This is clearly wrong (+ -2.2...). The handling of this is done in
OutputForm and not in DoubleFloat. This shouldn't be from my point of
view. See the following mail for a fix :

http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2007-02/msg00119.html

Sorry,

Greg

I see the first result on 32-bit machines and the second one
on 64-bit ones.  AFAICS the difference is in least significant bit.
Since Lisp does not specify accuracy it is hard to call such difference
a bug.  To repeatable results one have to sacrifce some speed.
The are long flame wars related to this, see for example:

http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=323

My presonal attitude is: do not trust in least significant digit
(it may differ due to different rounding).

Expressions containing algebraic functions, in particular roots.
AFAICS SymPy does not support RootOf operation.

That is only remotely related to this.  Assuming that is fixed, you're
not going to repeat the same digiton Sparc and other architectures
that don't use 80 bits for long double.  Please, please, use something
that is not common across all major plaftorms: C's double which is

When I want use symbolic domain (which is rather rare) I want
a single domain.  So one should fix T first.  Natural candidate
for T is Integer.  But Expression Integer is a field of
characteristic 0.  I can easily imagine expresions which go
beyond that (noncommutative variables, zero divisors, mixed
characteristic).  Also ATM Expression Integer does not do
zero test before division but IMHO this is a bug.  OTOH
general symbolic domain may lack normal forms.

As far as I know so far Axiom just uses the underlying lisp values
from cos and acos.

I don't consider it a bug but I don't consider it "stable" either.
All other values of all other functions seem to give the same
result and that result matches the input in this case. It's a 
curious result though. I'd expect that they are using Chebyshev
polynomials and I'd have expected a symmetric result. Somebody
clearly "optimized" the world by saving an instruction somewhere.

The problem arose trying to explain a failing case in the
regression tests. Now that I understand it better it's not an issue.

Redefinition is probably of little (maybe no) use for end users.  But
domain developers have to modify them.  Ability to modify functions
"on the fly" is claimed to be significant debugging advantage of
"dynamic" language implementations (like Python or Lisp).

NI am _not_ advocating using dynamic capabilities of Axiom.  Rather
I wanted to point out that such capabilities are implemented and
I give my opinion why.

Yes.

Yes, that is precisely why CASes implement "generalized" polynomials
as symbolic expression domains and augment it with ad-hoc rules.

Well it certainly has been invented a large number of times.
There must be at least at least a half dozen implementations
of something like this in various languages.

ALLPROSE and AldorUnit are certainly useful in the environment
for which they were designed and I agree they provide an
excellent model of Axiom. But somebody - and as far as I can
see it is almost necessarily the original designers of these
packages - must take on the task of adapting them to Axiom.
For anyone else it is likely to be easier simply to re-
invent it. Unfortunately that is the real extent to which
we seem to be able to re-use software in most cases. :-(

Regards,
Bill Page.

Note also that in GCC-4.3, the compiler will be constant-folding
"non-trivial" functions called with constant arguments, e.g. sin(9.3),
thanks to MPFR and all that.  Consequently, the test must be precise
about what it is testing and how to reproduce the results across
platforms, otherwise we could just remove it.

Tim --

Consider the following line (extracted from src/interp/wi2.boot)

    ['SEQ,:l,['exit,1,x]] := item

This requires pattern matching, in particular, that the object denoted
by "item" has the structure implied by the left hand side.  This
particular construct is handled in bootsys by the routine bfLET
(src/boot/tytree1.boot), and more precisely by bfLET2 which I
reproduce below.  

Currently, the above will produce an error with bootsys, but not with
depsys (which is the old Boot translator).  The error is not that of
syntax issue, but that of a bug lurking in bfLET2.  

When bfLET2 proceeds decomposing the left hand side, it eventually
comes to  

    ['exit,1,x] := t1

where t1 is identifier I just invented for the purpose of the
presentation.  Then, bfLET2 does not know what to do with the literal
"1" that appears on the left hand side, therefore errors out.  It
appears that the code that handles that part has been commented out
(and replaced by call to bpTrap which is wrong as we're at the
semantics processing phase, not parsing), with no explanation.
Indeed, the assignment 

        ['exit,1,x] := t1

is semantically equivalent to

        t1 is ['exit,1,x]

Do you remember having commented that part out and if so why?

The whole boot/shoe parser was a complete black box delivered whole
by Bill Burge so I don't know the details.

It looks like

['SEQ, :l, ['exit,1,x]] := item

tries to take a lisp s-expression and decompose it to extract
the "l", inner list construct. The axiom SEQ seems to expect
an (exit ....) s-expression as the last expression in the seq.

It may be that the convention changed and SEQ no longer required
the last s-expression to be an exit call but I don't know for sure.
The "1" might have been an error code? The s-expression this expects
seems to look like:

  (exit 1 x)

so maybe it was intended as an error code? If you can find the
runtime implementation of exit that might give you a clue.

You'll often see this kind of code (from SF.NRLIB/code.lsp)

(defun |DFLOAT;manexp (|x| $) (prog .....[snip]....
  (return (seq (exit (cond ((zerop |x| ...[snip]....

Quoting daly@axiom-developer.org:

OK.  I assumed you did some editing there; that turns out to be
an erroneous assumption.

Yes, I understand what the code means, and how it should be
handled by bootsys.  My analysis led me do bfLET2 which
was not doing the right thing because the code that should
handle it was commented out and replaced by bpTrap() -- which
is not OK, as bpTrap() concerns itself only with syntactic
issues.

The problem is not that of exit.  The problem is that of a
literal appearing in the pattern and bfLET2 being confused.
You can see that in the bfLET2 code, or you can test with
something like this:

% cat t.boot && bootsys -batch -eval '(boottran::boottoclc "t.boot")'
foo t ==
   ['BAR, 2, x] := t
   x
ERROR IN LINE 2
   ['BAR, 2, x] := t
...................|
unexpected  LET code is generated in this line
2
ERROR IN LINE 2
   ['BAR, 2, x] := t
...................|
syntax error
ignored from line 2
   ['BAR, 2, x] := t
...|
ignored through line 2
   ['BAR, 2, x] := t
...................|


I've changed bfLET2 to handle allow literals in
the patterns, currently algebra layer 13 is being
built.  I'll report when the build finishes.

Thanks!

Gaby,

This is just a quick note to say that I REALLY appreciate the
work that you are continuing to do with Boot and the Axiom
build machinery in general. I think these improvements are
very important to the long term stability and maintainablity
of the system.

Thank you!

Regards,
Bill Page.

Thanks for the kind words.  I still need to put all the documentation
together.  So what I've been doing lazily is to put all my notes
in a sort of doodle pad file; I hope to clean it a bit and make
it available so that others can help improve it.

I'd like to second that thank you!  Being able to target sbcl as a
delivery platform would open up a lot of possibilities in terms of
interaction with other Lisp libraries.

Gaby, does this result mean that the Algebra code up through layer 13
can be successfully built by shoe/new boot without needing the old boot
at all?

Cheers,
CY

sorry I was being unclear.  What I meant was that at the time I sent the
message, I modified bfLET2 as I finally committed, and I had several
other interpsys Boot files translated by shoe and the result was strong
enough to survive the build till algebra layer 13.
We still need the old boot translator to translate quite a few other
interpsys Boot files.
I would like to finish that conversion before getting back to committing
the work that has depsys buildable with CLISP (and SBCL).

Then, we may consider what we do with algebra files -- but then, it will
be summer and everybody will be on vacation :-)

It is generally admited that in Boot (whether old or new) an
identifier written in all uppercase is passed unmodified in the
generated Lisp code (except for T).  Right?

Well, Old Boot says "Wrong!".  Some of the all-uppercase identifiers
are renamed into case-sensitive uppercase, or renamed to some
something else.  Here is a short list I have:

  ASSOC        --> |assoc|
  DELETE       --> |delete|
  GET          --> GETL
  INTERSECTION --> |intersection|

Hello,

one can easily teach Aldor about the size of a Cross with the help of  =

extend. Then you can ask a Cross about the number of elements.
I already discussed the details with Ralf via private mail, so I am just=
  =

stating it here for the record. If anybody else is interested in this, I=
  =

will share some code.

I am not too sure whether it should compile.

First of all, I think notation is misleading here. The "=3D=3D" in

> S(T: PrimitiveType): PrimitiveType =3D=3D I;

does not necessary mean that the function S maps to the same I every tim=
e.  =

This is somehow the synopsis, now for the details.
 From my point of view, the above definition of S is a shorthand notatio=
n  =

for

   S: PrimitiveType -> PrimitiveType =3D=3D ( T: PrimitiveType ): Primit=
iveType  =

+-> I;

. (I quickly wanted to check the AUG on this concern, only to find out  =

that I cannot find my rewrite suggestion, but only Ralf's way (page 61) =
of  =

writing it. Nevertheless, I thoroughly believe, that my kind of writing =
it  =

is the way the compiler looks at it, and Ralf's way is just a short-hand=
  =

notation.)
Using this rewritten definition, it is more obvious, what the "=3D=3D" r=
efers  =

to. It definitely denotes that the function is constant, not the result.=
  =

But you did not claim otherwise.

Within the AUG, you'll find that typically only the left-hand side of th=
e  =

=3D=3D is seen at certain stages of compilation. So lets omit the righth=
and  =

part of S's definition:

   S: PrimitiveType -> PrimitiveType =3D=3D

Now it is indeed hard to see that

> 	A =3D=3D> S Integer;
> 	B =3D=3D> S String;
> 	a: A :=3D (0$I) pretend A; -- I need some value ...
> 	b: B :=3D (1$I) pretend B; -- forgive the "pretend" ...
> 	equal?: Boolean :=3D a =3D b;

should compile, there is no obvious reason (S Integer) and (S String)  =

should evaluate to the same PrimitiveType.

Having seen this from this more abstract point of view, let's investigat=
e  =

the right-hand side of S's definition

   ( T: PrimitiveType ): PrimitiveType +-> I;

. Why should this functional evaluate to the same PrimitiveType again an=
d  =

again (And this condition would have to be satisfied before allowing the=
  =

compiler to somehow compile above code)?
 From a previous discussion, we learned that in Aldor functions typicall=
y  =

are not functional. The exception are expressions in type context. "S  =

Integer" and "S String" are in type context in the above piece of code. =
 =

Nevertheless, type context does not resolve the problem, because it  =

basically tells us that the types of
   c: S Integer
and
   d: S Integer
match, not that the type of a and b match. Type context allows to compil=
e  =

the line

> 	a: A :=3D (0$I) pretend A;

as otherwise, S would be evaluated twice at Integer.
As the exception of non-functionality does not help or apply to the  =

problem. S has to be evaluated twice--once for Integer and once for  =

String. For each of the evaluations (which happen at run-time from my  =

point of view), the function S happens to return the same value. This  =

observation can only be made at run time and not at compile time, as the=
  =

"I" may be arbitrary code.

Your code is the rather (seldom case) where the value (I) is hidden just=
  =

to get more structure (S). One could argue that Aldor should treat this =
 =

case properly.
However, only slight variations of your code (e.g.:

   S(T: PrimitiveType): PrimitiveType =3D=3D Fraction I;

) have a different semantics. For such an S (with the above macros),

> 	a: A :=3D (0$I) pretend A;

should work (type context of S String), but

> 	a: A :=3D (0$I) pretend A;
> 	b: B :=3D (1$I) pretend B;
> 	equal?: Boolean :=3D a =3D b;

_has_ to fail. As Fraction Integer is not in type context, it _should_  =

give _different_ instances of fractions over the domain MachineInteger.
This was just to show that your code is really rather the special case. =
 =

Nevertheless, I see that you want and need the compiler to compile

> 	equal?: Boolean :=3D a =3D b;

in your setting. The first line of your message was

> The following text describes a weakness of the Aldor language.

so we both agree that this it not a bug in the compiler (sigh), but rath=
er  =

you need something Aldor has not been designed to do.



Kind regards,
Christian

Hello,

> details which Christian could report about.

yes, there are indeed several problems and after discussing some of them  
with Martin, he said he'll have a look. So not all issues are resolved yet  
and as it is not a top priority issue for myself now, I assume that some  
time will pass until there is some "AxiomUnit" from me or Martin.

Writing tests like

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2007-04/msg00030.html

basically works. But you don't get too much help from such a framework  
when resolving issues. For straightforward or obvious errors in code, such  
test might do. However, I assume you'll soon reach a point where you  
cannot test what you intend to test--because of the limitations imposed by  
your approach.
But don't get me wrong. I like every step towards test driven development.  
Be it some kind to specify tests or a full-blown testing framework.

In any case, I got used to JUnit and modelled AldorUnit after it. Since  
Axiom and Aldor are rather closely connected I think both sides would  
profit from using a common syntax to denote tests.

For example the Aldor-combinat project compiles to Aldor and Axiom. I  
suggest it would be of great value to them to be able to reuse their tests  
for the Axiom testing machinery.
I do not know Axiom too well. So can you point me to a document I can  
read, so I get the where your testing machinery is heading to? Afterwards  
it would certainly be good to discuss AldorUnit tests in Axiom and Axiom  
tests in Aldor.

Kind regards,
Christian

Axiom test plans are evolving based on need but with an eye
to longer term plans to leverage the effort. I'll try to 
cover some of my thoughts on the subject here.




In the gold and prior releases the testing was based on the 
input files and detailed review of the console logs, as well
as comparisons of intermediate files after each change. This
is very time consuming and clearly I must have missed a bug
or two since the algebra in silver seems broken somehow.

Rather than releasing a full merged gold/BI/WH, which is what
I was attempting I've backed off and decided to build up the
testing harnesses so I can hopefully catch the bug automatically.

There are various levels of testing and I'm working most specifically
on regression testing since that's what this latest release requires.
I'll lay out some thoughts here but these are not firmly fixed, just
some musings about testing and how it matches various subgoals I have.



REGRESSION TESTING...How it works

I have built a regression test harness that uses md5sum as a tool
to show me what might have changed in the build due to a change in
the source. Its only purpose is to focus attention on changes and
is not useful or informative in any other way.

I'm also in the process of rewriting the input files into a standard
form so they can be used for regression testing. Since regression 
testing is only trying to find things that differ but not find 
bugs a simple compare mechanism is sufficient. Thus I wrote a
lisp function called "regress" that will compare the results.
(diff is insufficient since we need to ignore certain things.)

The input file rewrite involves a couple steps. First I run the
input file in the "base case axiom" (this is the comparison
standard regardless of bugs). Running these input files gives 
me "stanzas" written to the output file. Thus if "foo.input"
contains the line:

2+3

and I do

  echo ")read foo.input" | axiom | >foo.output

I'll get foo.output containing:

2+3

 (1) 5
                             Type: PositiveInteger

Next I can use this for regression by rewriting the foo.output
file into a foo.input.pamphlet file. This new pamphlet file contains
the lines:

--S 1 of 1
2+3
--R
--R (1) 5
--R                             Type: PositiveInteger
--E 1

and what we see here is an "input file" with the input line
starting with "--S" and ending with the first "--R". The
expected results are prefixed by "--R", and the test ends
with the prefixed line "--E".

Running this input file again will now give:

--S 1 of 1
2+3

 (1) 5
                             Type: PositiveInteger
--R
--R (1) 5
--R                             Type: PositiveInteger
--E 1

and I then do:

  echo ')lisp (regress "foo.output")" | axiom >foo.regress

which gives:

regression result passed 1 of 1 file foo

or 

regression result FAILED 1 of 1 file foo

depending on the result of the compare.

REGRESSION TESTING...What we gain

The regression tests show where the algebra that is executed
might fail from system to system. I've already uncovered a
minor library difference between redhat and fedora systems 
that manages to poke its head into the axiom output.

I'm working my way back thru the gold versions in the arch archive 
to find where things might have broken.

Since the regression tests are in standard pamphlet format they
contain explanations in the resulting .dvi files.

Since the regression tests are in standard input file format
and they contain the results, we have an executable file format
that also documents the expected results. This can be extended
in many ways in the future to give us better coverage.

There are also a lot of interesting examples of algebra in
these files that should be better explained. Hopefully we'll
go back and expand them.





UNIT TESTING...How it might work

In the recent past I posted a file called ffrac.spad. I have various
planned usage for this file as a test case for new facilities in 
Axiom, including experiments in "drag-and-drop", "unit testing",
"cohen algebra", and some tutorial work in how to program.

You can see that I've "decorated" the functions with example
axiom input lines. These show the common and expected uses for
these functions. They will eventually evolve into unit tests.

The first constraint I have for unit tests is that they should
help explain and document the domain. It is very important that
we capture the developers insights into the code via the testing
strategy. What are reasonable input forms for the domain? What
are boundary tests? How can we coerce/convert to this domain or
from this domain to others? 

The unit testing might evolve along the lines of the regression
testing, for three reasons. First, the regression tests contain
the results so they document the expected response "inline".
Thus you can read the file and see what the results should look like.

Second, having a compatible format between unit tests and regression
tests means that the unit tests can be automatically used for regression.

Third, since both use the pamphlet file format we can evolve the 
"standard" (hah) for pamphlet files so that unit/regression test
chunks follow a common pattern. This would allow us to use the same
technique that Bill Page --foisted, ahem-- pioneered for selecting
algebra files automatically. :-)

If we "standardize" the unit/regresion testing then we can leverage
this for "drag-and-drop" extensions of the algebra, testing, and
documentation machinery.





ALDORUNIT? ...

It is unclear how AldorUnit will fit in to testing in the short
term. It depends in part on "next weeks announcement" from Aldor.
If we get a free Aldor and there is a push to write/extend/rewrite
the Axiom domains in Aldor then clearly this is the likely future
path.

Frankly I haven't spent sufficient time considering this in
detail because I'm trying to "get this release done". I managed
to let the release mechanism get out of control and that has
clearly cost me dearly.





THE FUTURE PLANS? .... guesses/musings/random nonsense

ZERO TESTS? ... the harder problem

Ideally unit tests would be written so axiom could verify
the results. Some tests might be written in the spirit of:

-- testing plus/minus inversion
a:=3+2
b:=7-2
((a-b)==0)::Boolean

but this requires a deeper knowledge of the various domains.
Yet even knowing that the expressions are equivalent and
having domain expertise doesn't guarantee that you can wrestle
axiom into admitting zero equivalence.




PAMPHLET -> LATEX subgoal

I'd like pamphlet files to be pure latex files. That way we
don't have to "preprocess" the files to latex them and we can
submit pamphlet files as standard tex files to conferences.

One of my long-term goals is to have an open literature in computer
algebra that includes the source code for the paper within the 
paper in a literate style. So there is a push to eliminate any
non-latex format. In the long term that implies that the noweb
syntax has to go away.

I've already written a preliminary version of noweb-style chunks
in latex so at some point the plan is to change the chunk naming
mechanism to be pure, standard latex (eg:
<<chunk name>>= becomes \begin{chunk}{chunk name}
@               becomes \end{chunk}
<<chunk name>>  becomes \use{chunk name}
and I hope to introduce this when time permits. Unfortunately
getting this release out has not been a simple job. Who knew? 

TESTING IMPLICATIONS

Thus one possible idea is to just use a standard chunkname for
the test/regress stanzas and have them be verbatim blocks. A
more interesting idea is to introduce a new environment that
would enable the input and output to be captured for the testing
purposes. This would just be an extension of the above idea.
Something like:

\begin{testchunk}{1}
2+3
\result{testchunk}{1}

 (1) 5
                             Type: PositiveInteger
\end{testchunk}{1}

This could be reformed to either print format or extraction format
for test. Thus the unit test/regression test machinery has to fit 
smoothly into the rest of the pamphlet machinery.

In fact, if this subgoal is met there will be no distinction 
between latex and pamphlet files, thus reducing the complexity
of axiom significantly.

Alternatively we could extend noweb to "know" about the testing
chunk format so that it will automatically prefix the chunk lines
with "--S", "--R", "--E", etc. when extracting for test purposes.
This would be reasonable to do in the short term and involve less
controversy.




PAMPHLET -> DRAG-and-DROP subgoal

I want people to be able to fire up axiom (likely using Doyen at
a conference) and be able to drag-and-drop a literate paper from
the conference onto a running axiom. This should:

  1) unpack the algebra
  2) unit test the algebra
  3) unpack the paper
  4) add the paper to the documentation in a deep way
     including updating the front end
  5) add the algebra to the system

A person should be able to execute the paper. If the paper
contains something like a "speed comparison" the person 
should be able to execute the paper and see his own results
for his system reflected in the paper.

Thus the unit test/regression test machinery has to fit 
smoothly into the rest of the pamphlet machinery.

TESTING IMPLICATIONS

The test/regressions stanzas have to fit fluidly into the whole
pamphlet file mechanism and be easy to recognize and extract.
Plus they must be "self-verifying" so that the results obtained
can be checked against the results expected. 

And we'd like the test cases to also serve as documentation of
correct use of the domain as well as its limits and assumptions.



COMPUTER ALGEBRA TEST SUITE (CATS)

I've mused about the long term goal of constructing a CATS
standard that could be used across all of the existing algebra
platforms. Such a standard would give credibility to the results
of existing systems and leverage the mathematical expertise toward
verifying results.

Consider a CATS document that explains some algorithm, such
as a GCD algorithm.

A CATS document would start with some area of computational 
mathematics, giving a mathematical explanation, a few math
problems that cover the area in question as well as boundary
cases. The document would then have the algorithm within it.
Ideally we'd be able to drag-and-drop this document and run
the tests. 

There are (at least) two challenges with this level of testing.

First we have the issue that the mathematics might cross 
several axiom domains. This implies that the testing is not
unit testing.

Second, we have the issue that the algorithm might cross
domains or have special cases in subdomains, etc. This would
mean that we'd have to make sure that the CATS examples 
include the special cases.


TESTING IMPLICATIONS

Ultimately we'd like the CATS test cases to "just run".
How they get structured within the CATS documentation, how
we capture the axiom output, and how we resolve the axiom
results with the CATS results are all things to think about.

I would prefer to eliminate all renaming at boot/shoe level.  Instead,
I would just define needed functions at Lisp level (partially in the
style of unlisp.lisp.pamphlet, but also using compiler macros for
efficiency).  Also, I consider using all-lowercase Lisp (making
a package "common-lisp" beeing a lowercase version of "COMMON-LISP",
and setting *readtable-case* to preserve).

The latter sounds like what Maxima went through with the Great Source
Downcasing a while back.  The emails on the Maxima list pertaining to
that might worth looking at.

The replacements GET --> GETL, READ --> VMREAD indicate, that=20
they were introduced to circumvent different semantics of

I have just had a look at the sources.=20

The redefinitions of=20
ASSOC, DELETE, INTERSECTION, MEMBER, RASSOC, REMOVE, UNION=20
seem to have the same source (all defined in vmlisp.lisp).
COMMON LISP has different semantics than VMLISP
(in this case with regard to equality in those functions).=20

In http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/347BugInMapSet

'oklhazi' reported that "map confuses sets" and gives
the example

  A:=set [-2,-1,0]
  B:=set [0,1,4]
  C:=map(x +-> x^2,A)
  test(C=B)

where the map operation produces a "Set" C with the same
elements as B but which is not equal to B, thus violating
a major axiom of set theory.

The documentation for Set

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/axiom--test--1/src/algebra/SetsSpad

says, (in part):

++ In our implementation, \Language{} maintains the entries
++ in sorted order.  Specifically, the parts function returns
++ the entries as a list in ascending order and the extract
++ operation returns the maximum entry.

but the example shows that this is not true even if the Set
is composed of elements from a domain which has OrderedSet.
In the #347 I proposed a simple patch to correct this
behaviour but it is easy to show that it still fails if the
element domain is not an OrderedSet.

At the following page:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSetAny

I have proposed an more ambitious fix that provides a constant
but otherwise arbitrary ordering for all SETs based on comparing
the Lisp SXHASH of the elements:

order(x:S,y:S):Boolean == integer(SXHASH(x)$Lisp)$Sexpression
                          < integer(SXHASH(y)$Lisp)$Sexpression

This provides an easy to compute order but since this is a
hash the ordering is in general only a partial order, so perhaps
this is not such a good idea?

The reference:

http://www.lisp.org/HyperSpec/Body/fun_sxhash.html#sxhash

says:

"3. The hash-code for an object is always the same within a
single session provided that the object is not visibly modified
with regard to the equivalence test equal.

"4. The hash-code is intended for hashing. This places no
verifiable constraint on a conforming implementation, but the
intent is that an implementation should make a good-faith effort
to produce hash-codes that are well distributed within the
range of non-negative fixnums.

---------

So my question for Axiom Developers and Lisp aficionados is
what is your opinion of the use of SXHASH? How well does SXHASH
behave in GCL? What might be a reasonable alternative for
defining a total ordering on the elements of a Set given the
possibility of the type 'Set Any'?

Also on page SandBoxSetAny I proposed a patch to the code for
the domain Any that makes use of the Lisp EQUAL comparison
instead of EQ. I think that in general EQ is too restrictive.
Do you think this change is reasonable and correct?

Regards,
Bill Page.

I would say that sorting elements of Set is a design bug.
Namely, without any support form domain specific code it is
hard to define linear order.  AFAICS in Axiom only domains
which have OrderedSet are eqipped with linear order.

Hashing allows reasonably efficient implementation of set
operations.

If Set is implemented by sorting the linear order cannot be
domain specific since there certainly are domains from which
we might wish to form finite sets for which no "natural" order
can be defined, e.g. the domain Any. But I think it is always
possible to define some lexical ordering over the members of
all domains For example, the Axiom interpreter contains the
Lisp function LEXGREATERP in

  src/interp/ggreater.lisp.pamphlet

For the implementation of Set using sorting all that is required
is that the ordering be constant within an Axiom session.

Yes, but that would require a complete re-design of Set -
perhaps not a bad idea. Probably the current implementation
could be considered a little lame, but I was just looking for
a simple way to correct the existing bug. Axiom has other
domains that already use hashing such as EqTable so it might
be as easy as just choosing a different representation of the
Set domain.

You need an order which is consistent with equality.  Since
equality is domain-specific you need also domian-specific
order.  I agree that we do not have one handy.  Producing
order is not very hard.  Producing "from outside" order which
agrees with equality seem to be expensive (I am affraid that
you need to store all domain elements in a hash table).
That is why I am saying about design bug.

I am affraid that a complete re-design is the only real fix
for design bugs.

I do not agree. What do you think is wrong with LEXGREATERP
for this purpose?

AFAICS LEXGREATERP compares representations, completly ignoring
equality from domain.

Yes. Why do you say that this would not be consistent with
domain equality?

What problems would occur if elements of all finite sets
were ordered according to this ordering?

Domain elements may be mathematically equal but have different
representations.  AFAICS this happens for example for general
fractions.

We may miss duplicates and declare equal sets as unequal.

Hello,


At the boot level I want to know if a given type is valid. By type I
mean a category or a domain (parametrised if they must be). So for
example I want to know that 'Matrix(Character)' and 'Fields' are invalid
but not Matrix(Ring) and Matrix(Integer). There are several functions in
the interpreter for that but they are 'interactive' functions (in the
sense that they will throw an error if the type is not valid) or they do
not accept all possible categories. There is, for example, the function
'isValidType' but it seems to only accept domains and simple categories.
The nirvana would be a function that accepts things like
Matrix(Join(Foo,Bar)) [1]. 

Issues related are visible in the interpreter, try to type 
Matrix(Field) and List(Field).

Am I thinking wrong ?

Or may be you have some ideas or you know some functions that do what
I'm looking for ?

Greg

[1] This is doable, I think, via something like 'IGNORE_-ERRORS eval
mytype', but I would prefer a cleaner way.

Dear Bill, Waldek, *

Waldek Hebisch <hebisch@math.uni.wroc.pl> writes:

I disagree - but in fact, I believe that the statement above is due to
miscommunication:

"Set" uses the order of the underlying domain *if* the latter is an OrderedSet,
i.e., if it is totally ordered.  In my opinion, this is a very reasonable
decision.

If the underlying domain is not an OrderedSet, for example "ANY", then "Set"
will use slower algorithms, which do not depend on an ordering.

I think that this is very much in line with the philosophy of axiom. Note that
most domains have OrderedSet.

I think it is a mistake to pretend that a domain is ordered, using tricks like
hashing, within "Set".  If you really need fast set-operations for such a
domain, make it an OrderedSet.  However, I do not believe that making ANY an
OrderedSet is wise.  If your elements happen to be of type ANY and you need
fast Set operations for them, I'd suggest that you look for a better domain.

Martin

Ah yes, in this case there is no "canonical" representative.

Marin gives another examnple like that in:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/348EqualityInAny#msg20070405161506-0500@w=
iki
.axiom-developer.org

Martin refers to the description of "canonical" in HyperDoc:

"canonical is true if and only if distinct elements have
 distinct data structures. For example, a domain of
 mathematical objects which has the canonical attribute means
 means that two objects are mathematically equal if and only
 if their data structures are equal."

I guess one should interpret "distinct" as a synonym for x ~=3D y.
So this means that for some domain D with representation Rep

  x,y:D; x =3D y implies rep(x) =3D rep(y) and
         rep(x) =3D rep(y) implies x =3D y

where by '=3D' I am specifically referring to the functions
exported by D and Rep, respectively.=20

>=20

Yes, I see that you are right if the domain is not canonical.
HyperDoc only shows 5 domains with canonical, FourierSeries,
Fraction, Integer, RomanNumeral, and SingleInteger; although
I expect there are actually many more domains that could be
given this attribute.

I assume that when you wrote "formal fractions" above, you
were not refering to Axiom's 'Fraction' domain?

Besides, the "canonical" attribute, it seems to me that there
is something else interesting here that should to be stated
more formally.

I suppose that it might be possible to design a domain in
which two representives of a given domain are equal but that
the corresponding members of the domain are not equal. But
this is somehow not "natural". So a "natural" representation
would be one for which

  x,y:D; rep(x) =3D rep(y) implies x =3D y

I was thinking about something like this when I wrote:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/RepAndPer

I am still looking for any computer sciense publication that
addresses this issue of representation in a formal mathematical
way.

Bill Page.

You implied that Matrix(Ring) is valid, but it is not. Perhaps
this was a typo?

The definition of Matrix is

  Matrix(R:Ring)

I wonder if you mean something like: since both

  Integer has Ring
  Field has Ring

are true, why not both

  Matrix(Integer)
  Matrix(Field)

Field of course, is a category while Integer is a domain.

Can you give an example of a valid category for which isValidType
does not return T?

isValidType seems to work for me (of course this is just the
interpreter but the equivalent must work in Boot):

(1) -> mytype1:=["Matrix"::Symbol::SEX, ["Integer"::Symbol::SEX]::SEX]::SEX


   (1)  (Matrix (Integer))

                                        Type: SExpression
(2) -> mytype2:=["Matrix"::Symbol::SEX,
["Character"::Symbol::SEX]::SEX]::SEX          

   (2)  (Matrix (Character))
                                        Type: SExpression

(3) -> mytype3:=["FiniteSetAggregate"::Symbol::SEX,
["Integer"::Symbol::SEX]::SEX]::SEX

   (3)  (FiniteSetAggregate (Integer))
                                        Type: SExpression

(4) -> isValidType(mytype1)$Lisp


   (4)  T
                                        Type: SExpression

(5) -> isValidType(mytype2)$Lisp

   (5)  ()
                                        Type: SExpression

(6) -> isValidType(mytype3)$Lisp

   (6)  T
                                        Type: SExpression

I do not understand what you mean by this.

I think your examples are a little confused. Something can not
be a Field without also being a Ring, right?

Integer has Ring

Matrix(Integer)

Fraction Integer has Field

Fraction Integer has Ring

Matrix(Fraction Integer)

Maybe you could give another example?

No this is not a typo, I was not very clear, here I consider
Matrix(Ring) as a valid type. Something on which I can work at the boot
level (this is probably different than a "real" domain, I don't know,
this is in part why I first want to know if I'm working on a valid
type). When I say parametrised I consider a category as a valid
parameter. I can not rely on the interpreter and what it returns or on
some parts of the functions available in the src/interp directory (there
are also 'new' and 'old' functions).

(8) -> DirectProduct(3,IntegerNumberSystem)

   (8)  DirectProduct(3,IntegerNumberSystem)
                                      Type: Domain

The interpeter considers DirectProduct(3,IntegerNumberSystem) as a valid
domain (type ?) :-(=20

No, I thought, but I was wrong  :-(, thanks for pointing this out.
Think of a category, here, as the set of matrices over a ring
(Ring being a category in the Axiom sense).

Yes, I was not clear. I do not have a clear overview of what Axiom
does behind the scene but I suspect some error from my part and
I must put out some simple mistakes.

I want to know if I can extract information from what I call a
valid type, i.e:

)bo Matrix(Join(Field(),ConvertibleTo(InputForm())))

(|Matrix| (|Join| (|Field|) (|ConvertibleTo| (|InputForm|))))
Value =3D #<(SIMPLE-VECTOR 72) {10053B01FF}>

I'm interested by this vector :-).

Thanks for pointing out this -- I trusted documentation, but
documentation was wrong.  So, Bill first fix is fine if domains
has OrderedSett, but sorting must be conditional on OrderedSet.
I have now updated documentation and applied (to wh-sandbox) the fix.

When I wrote about design bug I meant idea of sorting something
which is not an OrderedSet.

Apparently ./configure did not locate the required sockets

if configure did not find the sockets headers, it would have
aborted at configure time.  My suspicion is that it did find
them, but somehow, it could not find the associated libraries.
Please, could you send me the config.log file and see where
there the socket library had been put in different file?

I tried to install openSolaris nevada build 60 on my Dell Optiplex
745, but eventually I gave up and installed SuSE instead. :-(
The reason being that openSolaris 64bit seems to be largely
unsupported by GNU tool chains, and openSolaris seems to ignore
many of GNU software. :-(

I've only installed it in a plex86 environment and haven't really
worked with it, but you might want to try Nexenta and see if that
works:  http://www.gnusolaris.org/

I don't know that 64bit support will be any better, but the GNU
toolchain support in Nexenta may be in better shape.

Cheers,
CY

Yes, I see. That is certainly possible. The Blastwave gnu tools
binaries and libraries are in a non-standard location under
/opt/csw

I've attached config.log (gz)

What I am running is technically not OpenSolaris but rather
Sun's Solaris 10.2 release. I found installation very simple.
Of course Solaris is still not as easy an installation as
most of the Linux distributions, but if you have been around
Solaris for a long time (like I have) then installing 10.2 is
comparatively much easier than Solaris used to be on some
Sun sparc hardware.

http://www.blastwave.org

tries hard to be like what Debian is for Linux and I find that
for the most part it works very well. You should find the support
for x-86-64 binaries essentially the same as for the sparc
architecture. Actually it is mostly Blastwave that has lured
me back to Solaris after nearly giving it up for Linux. Perhaps
it is only nostalgia, but for enterprise applications I am still
inclined to prefer Solaris over any of the Linux distributions.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Thanks for the pointer -- I did not know the status of other
openSolaris-based distribution, so after a week of frustration I gave
up (very strange for someone who's grown up in solaris environment,
isnt' it?)
I'll return to that later (probably end of the month or may).

I spend the morning having "fun" chasing bugs in Axiom with runtime
checking enabled.   Pretty scary.

That has the side effect of dramatically increasing the overall

Gaby,

I consulted:

http://sourceware.org/ml/automake/2004-01/msg00162.html

which seems to include the necessary Autoconf magic.

Indeed adding -lsocket to

gcc session.o -o ../../target/i386-pc-solaris2.10/lib/session
-L/export/home0/wspage/axiom-test/src/lib -lspad  -lsocket -o
../../target/i386-pc-solaris2.10/lib/session

seemed to do the trick.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Build completes normally after the following patch (tested by
applying the equivalent patch to my out-of-source build directory
axiom-test/src/sman/Makefile):

Does this make sense to you?

If so, I will retry the build from zero with this patch.

You're almost there.  Please could you try the patch below?
(I've not test a build yet, but it is along the line of what I think
should happen).  After apply the patch, you need to ./build-setup.sh

Many thanks.

| Revision 490 builds with no problems.

Grrr, I did not know I commited that change that was trying to
translate i-output.boot by bootsys.  The issue is that
i-output.boot contains an invalid boot comment -- someone was using
Lisp comment instead of boot comment, and ';' means sequencing, not
comment.  That but was there undetected since before
build-improvements was created and nobody noticed!
I'll fix that.

This is not too suprising, when you consider all the mails in this
newsgroup about errors with the following message
>> System error:
    Caught fatal error [memory may be damaged]
I always wondered why nobody recompiled the system with better error
checking, to localize these bugs. I'm glad you did that.

The patch I sent did not work on GNU/Linux boxes, for the reason that
there is no separate libsocket library.  Consequently, we must special

that does that and passes the build on an i686-suse-linux.  Please

Sorry, the earlier patch also did not work on 'i386-pc-solaris2.10'.
The same error as before. No -lsocket was added to the gcc command.
I will revert the earlier patch and svn update and try again.

The first thing to check immedately after ./configure is the
src/sman/Makefile, I guess...

Bill Page.

Huh.  It was added on my machine and compiler-link failed precisely
because the system ld could not find -lsocket.  I have special cased
solaris.  The build was OK on both i686-suse-linux and
x86_64-suse-linux.  If your build fails, please send me again your
config.log.

Yes, see what gets substituted there.

Perhaps I just screwed up the previous patch last night. The build
completed this time but I did have to make the following additional
patch:

-bash-3.00$ svn diff src/sman/Makefile.pamphlet

I think the build is ok now and I can start AXIOMsys. But I
do get an error when I try hyperdoc:

-bash-3.00$ axiom

HyperDoc does not start but otherwise Axiom is ok.

Any ideas on why ht.db is not found?

I haven't run HyperDoc recently from the build-improvements
branch. Have you tested this and do you expect it to work?

I will now try to build from wh-sandbox which I believe includes
a number of significant changes to hyperdoc which are not yet
brought into build-improvements.

Bill Page.

Waldek,

My attempt to build wh-sandbox from the most recent source
fails with a configure error:

-bash-3.00$ svn co
https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/wh-sandbox
...
A    wh-sandbox/configure.ac.pamphlet
A    wh-sandbox/axiomlogo.jpg
Checked out revision 496.
-bash-3.00$ mkdir axiom-sandbox
-bash-3.00$ cd axiom-sandbox
-bash-3.00$ ../wh-sandbox/configure 2>&1 | tee build
...
config.status: creating src/doc/Makefile
mkdir: "build/scripts": Not a directory
config.status: error: cannot create directory "build/scripts"

-------

Any ideas?

I will try to create 'build/scripts' and continue.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Oops, my stupid error. I meant to run:

-bash-3.00$ ../wh-sandbox/configure 2>&1 | tee build.log

Sorry. Please ignore.

Waldek,

Ok, I think I have a real problem to report this time. The
configure worked but make fails as shown below:

Perhaps wh-sandbox needs some more of the autoconf magic that
is now part of build-improvements?

Can you suggest how to proceed?

Thanks.

Bill Page.

Yes, currently there is a breakage concerning HyperDoc that I
introduced some time ago but never got around to fix (as I don't use
it).  I'll refocus on that.  Sorry.
Many thanks for testing and reporting back.

Waldek recently did cherry picking of various patches from

Hmm, you're giving both a file and a directory the same name; that is
likely to cause troubles.

OK, I found where the bug comes from.  It is a very stupid bug.

A while ago, I added support for relative paths -- that was a
necessary step to make axiom.build-improvements buildable on Windows.
I believe that is when HyperDoc stopped working.  The reason?
Well, a very sloppy logic in the HyperDoc source code. 


More precisely, the function src/hyper/addfile.c:build_ht_filename

static int

        strcpy(aname, name);
        extend_ht(aname);
        for (ht_file = -1, trace2 = HTPATH;
             ht_file == -1 && *trace2 != '\0';) {
            for (trace = fname; *trace2 != '\0' && (*trace2 != ':');)
                *trace++ = *trace2++;
            *trace++ = '/';
            *trace = 0;
            if (!strcmp(fname, "./")) {

        return (ht_file);
    }
}


The comment fragment

    if (cwd(name)) {
        /* user wants to use the current working directory */

is deceptive because here is how it is deduced that user wanst the
current working directory


   #define cwd(n) ((n[0] == '.' && n[1] == '/')?(1):(0))


That is only the first two characters are tested!
It happens that in the build machinery we use things like

  ./../../target/i686-ps-linux-gnu

and teh cwd() macro thinks that that is current working directory!
Ahem.

The other fragment

    else if (pathname(name)) {
        /* filename already has the path specified */

is equally deceptive.

Cherry picking from axiom.build-improvements is asking for trouble.
I would have thought that merge from axiom.build-improvements should
be done whole sale to keep in sync.  If you find a problem that needs
addressing please let us know (and even better send a patch :-).

Yes, I could commit this change but I just noticed that I am using
autoconf-2.61 so 'build-setup.sh' produces a lot of "housekeeping"
changes in 'configure'. Do you want me to include the new onfigure
in the commit? Or will you update it later?

Bill Page.

Yes it is valid according to the defintion

  DirectProduct(dim: NonNegativeInteger,R: Type)

It is odd perhaps, that R is specified as just Type, but this
is technically possible. What you should have written above is
something like:

  (9) -> [Integer,SingleInteger,MachineInteger]::%

not [1,2,3] since IntegerNumberSystem is a category and only
domains belong to categories, not the objects of some domain.

But my expression (9) above fails for another reason - because
currently Axiom has no domain named Domain.

(10) -> [Integer,Integer,Integer]

   >> System error:
   The function |Domain| is undefined.

I think this can be fixed. See the page

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/209TheFunctionDomainIsUndefined

The example is in Aldor but this can be more easily written in Spad.
Axiom needs a domain called Domain whose objects are domains. But
this idea still needs more work.

Well there is the category:

MatrixCategory(R: Ring,Row: FiniteLinearAggregate R,
                       Col: FiniteLinearAggregate R)

(10) -> Matrix(Integer) has MatrixCategory(Integer, Vector Integer,
                                           Vector Integer)

   (7)  true

                                                 Type: Boolean

I think it is reasonable to describe MatrixCategory as the set
of matrices over a ring.

Do you suppose in this example that Matrix is something other than
what is currently defined in the Axiom library? If so, then perhaps
"Matrix" is not a good name for what you want.

I suppose that Join also that Join must be a category constructor
which the interpreter might also have to understand.

That concerns me a lot. I think that both Gaby and Waldek have done
an enormous amount of really important work on the Axiom build system
and this should continue. But for other axiom developers and axiom
users to really benefit from *both* of these efforts, I think we need
to merge the results at the current stage of development into a new
Axiom Silver distribution that builds on as many systems as possible
and which includes critical fixes to HyperDoc and some very important
fixes to Axiom's algebra.

What can I do to encourage you (Waldek and Gaby) to devote some
time to such a merge?

I will be glad to do that when/if I can.

I really have to second that. It is not unlikely that I lost a very important
user (Neil Sloane) - because of difficulties to build.  This might as well ruin
the success of my guessing package in the scientific community, since: "if
Sloane wasn't able to build it, why should I try?"

Of course, I am in a bad position, since I did not contribute anything but
algebra code, so I can only beg.

PLEASE PLEASE merge!

Second most important thing: make HyperDoc run on Windows. I'm in the process
of advertising Axiom for the departments of Mathematics and physics at Vienna
University, since they are going to take a decision between Maple and
Mathematica.  One of the major issues is about integrated help
functionality. With Waldek's patches to HyperDoc, it is *really* usable, and it
seems that it will take a long time to have the same functionality on a
webbrowser, given that there is so much discussion to do.

I do the best I can to improve the algebra and to attract more scientists to
use and improve axiom, but I have to rely on you to make Axiom build and
organize all these improvements. I'm well aware of the fact that many of you
are also more interested in the algebra than in the build process... And I am
really grateful for all your work!

Martin

Why do you want relative paths on Windows?  AFAICS relative paths
cause a lot of trouble and the simplest way to handle them is
converting to absolute path as soon as possible.

Configure machinery should be in place, but build-improvements
also changed src/lib files to use results of configure run.
So one have to merge changes to src/lib (and possibly also
other C parts).

Could you elaborate: you say that relative paths are needed on
Windows but you did not say why?

try to build Axiom out of source under MingW.

It gave me lots headache, only to discover later that the absolute
path seen by configure is not the one other tools were expecting.
A workaround was to use "pwd -W" -- only under mingw, because -W
is a non-standard option, only to get into another whoop.

One thing I used to do on the windows machine I was testing
the build is to checkout the working directory on a USB key,
boot under windows, try the build there, fix things, and reboot
back under linux.  That does not work if paths are required to
be absolute -- don't ask me why.

Finally, I solved the issue by making Axiom to accept relative path.

Please notice that what it means is that none of the Axiom component
should assume that $AXIOM is an absolute path; they should only care
that it is a valid path.  The software isn't more difficult or less robust to
write that way.  At installation time, $AXIOM can be set to an absolute
path, which makes all other paths absolute.  Note also that Axiom
is designed to be "re-routed".

There is nothing gained in writing the components to assume that
all paths are absolute.  We could as well assume that Earth is flat.

That was the point of doing the exercise -- things are detected

Oh, yeah, one more thing: mingw uses windows native tools, in
particular options  start with forward slash.  I don't remember the
exact details, but at some point some of the absolute paths (using
Unix-style notation) started being interpreted as options; it isn't funny.

I did not try to build Axiom (I tried GCL first, and it seems that
GCL build fails unless you have the exact versions of software
used by Mike Thomas).  I know that Mysys (and Cygwin) is remapping
files (I hit the problem once).  MingW executables expect native
Windows paths, but the build tools are Mysys executables and remap
paths.  So if yonemix calls to  MingW and Mysys executables
(which happens if you run freshly build MingW binaries) one
have trouble.  My solution was to use paths with explicit drive
letter: AFAIK such paths are not remapped.

BTW: Without drive letter Windows path is still relative with
respect to current drive.

Relative $AXIOM have to change when you change directory.  This
means that some variable settings have to be repeated.  Passing
of filenames to programs working in different directory become
harder.  Also relative paths are likely to hardwire relative positions
of directories, making change harder.

Recently I noticed that in Lisp relative paths behave in funny way
(it looks that Axiom is frequently calling truename to make
paths absolute and avoid problem).

So there are costs (IMHO substantial) to relative paths.

Explicit drive letter should cure this problem.

Um.  I'm not quite following you here Waldek - isn't that the whole
point of relative linking?  We set $AXIOM once to define where the
toplevel Axiom directory is located, and then everything else changes
automatically?

Can you give an example?  I'm missing something, I think - what is the
difference between having $AXIOM/lib/lib1.spad vs.
/usr/local/axiom/mnt/linux/lib/lib1.spad?  If I am in $AXIOM/lib and I
tell the program to output to $AXIOM/bin, or I want a file in ../input/
or $AXIOM/input, (or for that matter $AXIOM/$INPUT if you want to
generalize) those should Just Work.  Perhaps lisp has some limitations
here?

Now I'm really confused.  How do absolute pathnames not hardwire things
as much as relative pathnames?

I confess I have not fully understood Lisp's handling of paths as yet,
so perhaps there are some issues I am not aware of.

Shouldn't Axiom not care at all what drive or directory it is in?  I
would think the only thing most of the system should need to know is
where other parts of the system are relative to the toplevel Axiom
directory - where that toplevel directory is located shouldn't make
much difference.  

I am sure I'm missing something important - is there an example where
the relative merits of the two approaches can be clearly seen?

Cheers,
CY

That might be why we have a different opinion on the issue.

[...]

| Relative $AXIOM have to change when you change directory.

Yes, but there are only *two* such variables and they are always set to
the same syntactic variable which Autoconf computes automatically for
me.  One of the variables need to be changed any, where absolute path
or not.

| This
| means that some variable settings have to be repeated.

I consider this a feature -- Axiom, was designed that way, whether you
use absolute path or not.  So this is a ed herring.

That does not follow.  Sorry.  Currently, that is what Axiom does, but
it does not mean that it has to do that because of relative path.  As
a matter of fact all the hardwiring of paths predate my work.

| 
| Recently I noticed that in Lisp relative paths behave in funny way

in several places, yes.  That predates the relative path support.
But please describe the problem in detail.  Notice also that GCL will
accept that you designate an "alternate" system directory with the
-lib option.
If you save to disk, many Lisp systems will forget forever where they
come from.  

| So there are costs (IMHO substantial) to relative paths.

Please be more specific; I've run into many build path issues, almost
all of them can be traced by to absolute path.  If there are costs, it
is one due to NOT coding the components without assming relative path.
Again, none of the components need absolute paths.  They just care
that a path is valid.

It did not for me.

I don't intend to spend more resources on a problem I consider solved.
However, you're free to do so, but please don't break my builds; I've
burnt enough cycles in that issue.

I don't know.  I'm happy that I can re-root Axiom, and Axiom was
designed that way.  I'm unhappy about some other choices, but they
seem minor with respect to what I ran into.

[...]

| Shouldn't Axiom not care at all what drive or directory it is in? 

Absolutely.  
Furthermore, I really, really, really care that users should simply
say 

    ./configure && make && make install

and be done with it.  Most users don't want, or don't have time to
fiddle with the build machinery.  If the try two times and it did not
work, they are likely to stay away from Axiom, not matter how Great we
think it is.  That is a simple fact.  We can argue that we should have
many binaries that people can download, but that is a separate issue
that does not change the simplicity of the build -- personally, I
don't like downloading binaries unless it is properly signed and I can
trace back to the author in can it turned out to be a scam. 

Now, that simple requirement means that the complexity has to be
shifted somewhere else; I don't want the build machinery to be
complex; relative paths helped me port to windows in reasonable amount
of time, and I do consider it important to facilitate porting without
assuming much on the host system.  Although my primary machine
is now windows only (because GNU/Linux cannot fully support it), I don't
intend to become a windows developer -- I don't have the time for
that.  Consequently, it is important that I don't spend too
much time solving windows only issues.  Your mileage may vary.

Markus,

I hope you do not mind that I am copying this to the Axiom
developer mailing list. I think there may be some other
people here who are interested in this subject.

Well, I thinks that's a pretty ambitious project just to do
your homework! :-) But I think this is interesting for much
more than that.

> MediaWiki is written in PHP.

Yes. Very famous. It is the wiki software behind Wikipedia.
I think it is a very good choice (except for PHP, but that's
a different story).

I don't know what you mean exactly by "properly interface with
Axiom". Axiom can generate LaTeX output for the results that it
calculates. I assume that if you are interested in Axiom, you
are also interested in symbolic computer algebra in some form
or other - otherwise I don't see much point in using Axiom just
to generate LaTeX output. I think you would find it rather
awkward if that was all you wanted it to do.

I suppose that you are familiar with the Axiom Wiki web site:
http://wiki.axiom-developer.org
If you are using Axiom for statistics - even if it is just for
a course - then you are certainly welcome to use this web site
(which is publically available) or it's sister portal site:
http://portal.axiom-developer.org
where you can log-in and control who gets access to the pages
you prepare. We are always interested in more examples of
applications where Axiom can be used. Your exercises might
help other people realize how Axiom can be used in their
own situation.

As you can discover from the wiki site, these web sites are
based on Zwiki, Zope and Python - quite different from most
PHP applications although they accomplish mostly the same
thing in the end.

If you are more interested in continuing the development of
a general purpose MediaWiki plug-in that allows MediaWiki to
send commands to Axiom and display the results on a wiki page
in nicely LaTeX typeset form, then as an Axiom developer I am
very interested in that. I would very much like to be able to
offer such an interface for Axiom to other MediaWiki users.
So I would be glad to help you with this.

Axiom is not designed with this kind of security in mind, but
in the PHP interface to Axiom, it would be possible to intercept
commands which might execute arbitrary code and still leave a
significant subset of Axiom available to the user. If malicous
code is a serious risk, I think the best option would be to run
Axiom in a chroot environment or perhaps on a separate virtual
machine using Xen or other VM tool.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Bill --

Tha patch below addresses the issues you have raised:
  
  * It adds the additional C runtime libraries for linking programs
  * It brings HyperDoc back.

For the second point, 

  (1) I removed a workaround for Autoconf-2.59 bug, whereby
      top_builddir was left undefined -- therefore I added ./ to
      imply correct semantics.  Since that bug was fixed in
      Autoconf-2.60 and later, we don't need it anymore.

  (2) We were not telling htadd that we were building the system
      database.  Fixed by supplying the option "-s" so that htadd can
      look up the value of the AXIOM environment variable.

Tested on an x86_64-suse-linux.  Committed to build-improvements.

Please let me know if it works on your solaris box.

Waldek,

On April 9, 2007 9:59 AM you wrote:

>=20

I checked the revision log for bsdsignal:

http://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/axiom/branches/build-improvements=
/sr
c/lib/bsdsignal.c.pamphlet?view=3Dlog

apparently wh-sandbox is missing build-improvements revision 366.

I have merged these changes with my working copy of wh-sandbox
and the build is progressing normally (now at Stage 2 object
bootstrap). It may take another few hours to complete.

The diffs are attached. Would you like me to commit this to
wh-sandbox if it completes normally or should I leave that up
to you?

Note: I am using autoconf-2.61 so configure may differ slightly.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Yay!

Now, I'm testing a patch that brings Axiom.build-improvements back to

GCL-2.6.8pre and Msys voodoo going on.  The patch is ismple though.

Oops, the build just completed on windows.

Oh, HyperDoc does not appear when started from within Axiom? I'd call that a
bug. (I'm not using TeXmacs, anybody out there who knows?)

However, it is not so inconvenient as you might think.  When Axiom is doing a
big calculation, HyperDoc becomes unresponsive.  Thus I often start a second
Axiom, to do some browsing while I let Axiom compute.  Maybe you want to write
a tiny shell script like

## call this file axiom and put it into your private ~/bin directory ##########
#! /bin/bash

$AXIOM/bin/axiom
$AXIOM/bin/axiom $@
###############################################################################

(i.e., first start axiom without any parameters, which you will use for
HyperDoc browsing, then start the "real" axiom process, which TeXmacs will
use.)

> And how do Windows users get their Axiom help?

They don't :-(.  It's too sad, but we have not found a programmer who is either

* willing to port HyperDoc to MS Windows (HyperDoc relies on X)

or

* willing to write a HyperDoc replacement as outlined in
  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SummerOfCode2007 and many many long email
  discussions.

If you have somebody handy, please tell me immediately.  We can even pay a
(very) symbolic amount of money.  If he decides today (deadline is April 11),
he probably can do it as a Summer of Code project and earn 4500$.  In this case
he should apply here:

http://lispnyc.org/soc.clp

and mention Martin Rubey as (inofficial) co-mentor.

No. Of course HyperDoc does not start when Axiom is used under
TeXmacs. TeXmacs (normally) uses only AXIOMsys.

Martin, your "advice" is confusing. TeXmacs starts it's own
copy of Axiom. It cannot use a previously started process.

I didn't say that the first process should be used by TeXmacs. It is just there
for HyperDoc to pop up.

OK, I didn't know that TeXmacs uses AXIOMsys. So, maybe it is possible to
modify TeXmacs to start HyperDoc? Alternatively, write a script that first
starts axiom normally (such that HyperDoc can be used) and then starts TeXmacs
(which will start it's own axiom mode, of course)

> Sorry, but Summer of Code application deadline was March 26.

LispNYC says that their deadline is today. If I misunderstood, please remove
the advertisment on the Frontpage.

Hi,

  With a recent version of msys (Windows XP), I'm seeing a surprising
behaviour where the '::' in boottran::boottoclc will be passed to the
Lisp image as a semicolon!  I don't know whether is GCL doign it or
msys, but I think it is msys.

  Another hunk of this patch concerns the use of "ln -s".  With
Autoconf-2.60 and later, Autoconf test all possible ways of using 
"ln -s" (between files, from files to directories, etc.) and if any of
those possibilities fails, Autoconf deduces that "ln -s" is unusable on
the platform, therefore default to "cp -p".  In the cases where we use 
"ln -s", it is for just creating a symlink to a directory (which works
on msys) and the fallback "cp -p" just does not work for that
situation!  So, I explicitly set LN_S to "ln -s" -- that is incorrect
for theoretical maximum portability, but from practical portability
point of view, it is OK.

Tested on an i686-pc-linux and i686-pc-mingw32.
Committed to build-improvements.

Ok.

Yes, it is possible. There are some instructions for this on
the wiki somewhere I think. Of course it is only applicable to
TeXmacs running on Linux. This also enables the use of Axiom
graphics.

Student applications closed March 26. Today (April 10) is the
day that all applications must have assigned mentors. Revisions
and comments on applications submitted before March 26 will be
accepted until April 11 at which point the winners will be
posted by Google.

http://code.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=60325&topic=10729

But Google has been juggling these dates a little, perhaps there
is a little slack, however I do not think any new applications
are being accepted.

Unfortunately we did not receive any eligible applications from
students regarding Axiom. :-( I think we should try to analyze
why that happened. Although I do think that Lisp is an important
programming language, I fear that Axiom's association with Lisp
is of very little benefit to Axiom. It seems that very of the
already very few student Lisp programmers are really interested
in Axiom... Does anyone have any other ideas about why we did
not receive any applications?

I have just updated FrontPage.

Do you mean when passed via the command line? I think MSYS does
do some mangling of things it thinks might be file names. There
is a difference for Windows in the PATH separator - Windows
uses ; instead of :. Perhaps that is relevant. But you might
want to report this to the MSYS developers.

As far as I know autoconf is right and Windows does not support
symlinks. I recall that MSYS actually internally "implements"
'ln -s' as a copy. I am not sure why you say 'cp -p' doesn't
work. What error do you get?

Thank you for you continuing work to support a Windows version
of Axiom in the build-improvements branch.

Here is the result. AXIOMsys was built but the build failed
again in sman. (I presume like in build-improvements although
the error message is different.) I will try to debug this later
today:

We should all view Lisp as just an *assembly language* for the
Axiom runtime system.  Any argument that elevates Lisp to the level of
Axiom on whatever ground completely misses the whole point.
Lisp, as any other assembly language in a high-level system, should be
rarely be advertised.  It is of interest only to those who want to go
under the cover and dismantle the system -- there are very people of
those.  We may very well just have an Axiom Virtual Machine that does
not require full Lisp power.

Spad and the computational aspect is what we want to advertise.

BTW, it would be great if either you or Alfredo can make a new Windows
binary (from build-improvements or wh-sandbox, whichever builds).

I believe it is saying that the directory sman does not exist -- so it

There is a problem with the diff: configure.ac.pamphlet in wh-sandbox
is synced with build improvements 485 (the differences are intentional).
It looks that your diff reverts configure.ac.pamphlet to some earlier
version.

For succesful build on Solaris you probably also need the recent
-lsocket change (IIRC this was after version 485).

FYI: the src/boot and src directory is synced with build improvements 485.
In src/interp and src/algebra I belive that I picked all changes
that I now want to go into wh-sandbox -- in this sense both directories
are synced, but differences are significant (I may use some changes later
but ATM other changes conflict with my work).  Other directories
(src/lib, src/clef, src/sman, src/graph, src/hyper) were synced
with build improvements 358 and need re-syncing.

Some changes will require work to resolve conflicts with changes to
wh-sandbox so it will take some time before I will sync all
directories.  There are some cleanup (and preparation for SBCL
port) related to recent merge which I prefer to do first.  Also
ATM I working via text-only connection, so I prefer to defer
work on graphics for few days (I will be them back to my machine).
I 
If bsdsignal.c change works separatly then please commit it 
(but without the configure changes).

Personally I agree with your conclusion, however I have been
waiting the last few years for some more Lisp-oriented people to
appear who are interested in participating in the Axiom project.

Yes. Aldor for example provides a "C" run-time environment that is
in essence a "Lisp" virtual machine. It is conceivable that Axiom
could be re-written in Aldor running in this environment - although
that would be **lot** of work.

I am willing to help anyone who wants to do this. I created the
previous Windows binary distribution more than two years ago.
I could do it again now but I think there would be greated
benefit if someone else also participates in this task.

Yeah, sort of; this is from document.in.
Note that similar thing in the Makefile works -- and the makefile is
supposed to use the same shell.

Definitely, something things that it sees a path separator when it is
not.

| As far as I know autoconf is right and Windows does not support

Except that I'm talking of msys, not windows.  Autoconf is right in
its decision but for a different reason: it does not know beforehand
how I'm going to use "ln -s"; therefore it should not tell me that 
"ln -s" works, when in fact it is "ln -s" works with qualification.

The exact fallback has this comment:

   if ln -s conf$$.file conf$$ 2>/dev/null; then
     as_ln_s='ln -s'
     # ... but there are two gotchas:
     # 1) On MSYS, both `ln -s file dir' and `ln file dir' fail.
     # 2) DJGPP < 2.04 has no symlinks; `ln -s' creates a wrapper executable.
     # In both cases, we have to default to `cp -p'.
     ln -s conf$$.file conf$$.dir 2>/dev/null && test ! -f conf$$.exe ||
       as_ln_s='cp -p'
   elif ln conf$$.file conf$$ 2>/dev/null; then
     as_ln_s=ln
   else
     as_ln_s='cp -p'
   fi


Notice that  the first test passes fine -- the only way we use "ln -s".
It is the second test that fails -- when one uses a file as first
argument and a directory as the second argument.  

Try

    $ cd /tmp && mkdir foo && touch bar
    $ ln -s bar foo

You should get an error.  However

   $ rm bar && ln -s foo bar

works just fine.  That is what we use.
   

| I recall that MSYS actually internally "implements"
| 'ln -s' as a copy. 

More like a link than a copy in recent versions -- it augments the
"inode" counts.

| I am not sure why you say 'cp -p' doesn't
| work. What error do you get?

Oh, cp by defaults works on files.  It you want to use it on
directories then you have to specify -r.  That behaviour is uniform
and not specific to msys.  Therefore Autoconf is wrong to default to 
"cp -p" when it does not know how I'm going to use LN_S.

Yes that is possible. I merged changes in configure.ac.pamphlet
from r 366. If configure is already at r 485, that was my
mistake.

I was expecting that but received a different error message -

Ok. I will revert my changes to configure so that I have
wh-sandbox at r 485 again and repeat the build.

Thanks!

My guess is that change to configure broke it and configure 
decided that there is no socket support.  Consequently configure

A few, none of which have any particular supporting evidence:

a)  There are very few students interested in CAS work
b)  Axiom is not a CAS that appeals to students (this has been
discussed in the past - there are good reasons for Axiom doing things
the way it does but the benefits take time to appear).
c)  Using GCL in non-ANSI mode is not a work environment that would
appeal to most lisp programmers today (no SLIME, many standard libs
won't work, etc...)
d)  There is still a lot of "cleanup" work to be done before more
interesting projects that will produce user visible results will begin
e)  The "learn the territory" work needed to do useful work on Axiom is
much more extensive as opposed to other projects (learning how Axiom
does things and how to change them without breakage is a process WE are
still going through, after all...) - a single summer is not a lot of
time to both get up to speed and code something interesting.

The work that is being done on the branches now will help to address
many of these problems (running on SBCL should be a big help...)

For example, I've wondered about the possibility of using the
hunchentoot code http://weitz.de/hunchentoot/ to define a "gateway" for
Axiom IO that would be used for everything - have the terminal connect
to it, a webpage interface connect to it, and a GUI connect to it. 
Essentially Axiom would become the mathematical "server" and all client
interaction systems would talk to it through the same basic mechanism,
with different communications protocols being chosen based on the
interface connecting.  Mathematica uses this kernel-client approach,
but they defined their own protocol to do it called MathLink.  I'm
wondering if Axiom couldn't achieve the same result with the server
code in hunchentoot, and more or less for free get a web interface at
the same time.  However, this requires a) sufficient knowledge of
Axiom's systems to know how to set up something like that and b) a
system on which hunchentoot and its requirements (and there are a
number of those) can be run - i.e. not GCL in its current form.  When I
look at trying to do this from the SoC point of view, I can see that
Axiom would be a very intimidating prospect.  Most other projects would
have similar hurdles.

I think in the future Axiom will fare better, as we are slowly cleaning
up the system and porting to SBCL et. al.  That should be one big step
forward, and improved code documentation also will be a big help.

Cheers,
CY

I must say that this question makes me a little angry.  There is at least one
*very* simple reason why we will not participate in SOC:

I prepared a wiki page, in the contents of which I put roughly five hours,
trying to prepare something which would be focussed and possible to
tackle. (not all of this effort is visible on the page, I did do some more
thinking) In fact, I also prepared a rather detailed application for google.

I then asked for mentors to step forward.  I got *very* little response, and in
the end, *not a single person* was ready to send me his/her google account
adress as required by google.

In other words, I wasted a lot of energy.

It is quite obvious to me why nobody from the lisp community wanted to write
something for axiom: the projects I proposed had nothing at all to do with
lisp... Furthermore, the last lisp project was, in my opinion, a complete
failure.

I guess that it would have been possible to prepare some lispy project, for
example cleaning up the boot compiler.  This might have been interesting, but
I'm unable to prepare such a project for several reasons:

* I do not know enough about the boot/lisp internals of axiom

* I doubt that it would be very interesting for somebody not enthusiastic about
  the axiom project

* I'm not sure whether it would be useful.

I believe it is not true that there are too few interested people in CAS.  At
least Ondrej stated that he had more students applications than he could
mentor, and I'm convinced that this is only partially due to Pythons
popularity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finally, I'd like to ask you for help.

It seems that I have lost (more or less) Neil Sloane. I hope I'll be able to
win him back, it is very important for me personally.  I am currently extremely
close to having to stop maths (and thereby also axiom), and I badly need some
"success" stories.

I am also advertising axiom at the maths and physics departments of Vienna
university -- that's one of the bigger players in the game, by the way.

I am not sure what I can ask for, I only know what would be most helpful
(regarding non-mathematical projects):

* HyperDoc or a HyperDoc replacement on Windows

* a free Aldor, or, since this is quite unlikely to happen, SPAD becoming more
  Aldor-like. Furthermore, but maybe also a first step, Axiom should understand
  Aldor's "extend".  Concerning SPAD becoming more Aldor-like, the most
  important thing would be to allow signatures as used in the Species project:

SPECIES ==> (L: LabelType) -> CombinatorialSpecies L;

Plus(
    F: SPECIES,
    G: SPECIES
)(L: LabelType): CombinatorialSpecies(L) == add {
        Rep == Union(left: F L, right: G L);
        import from Rep;
        <<implementation: Plus>>
}


  (To make this easies to understand, here is a usage example:

Partition(L: LabelType): with {
        <<exports: Partition>>
} == add {
        <<representation: Partition>>
        import from Rep;
        <<implementation: Partition: auxiliary functions>>
        <<implementation: Partition>>
}

  is used (in Axiom roughly) like

generatingSeries()$Partition(Integer)

  which would give the generating function for the Bell numbers, or

structures(set [1,2,3])$Partition(Integer)

  which would return all set partitions of [1,2,3]: [[1,2,3]], [[1,2],[3]],
  [[1,3],[2]], [[2,3],[1]], [[1],[2],[3]]


P2 ==> Plus(Partition, Partition)(Integer)

generatingSeries()$P2

  would return twice the generating series of the set partitions.



  Another remark: I'm meanwhile more convinced than ever that SPAD is simply a
  subset of Aldor.  A while ago, somebody said that "==" would have different
  semantics, since "==" would mean "delayed evaluation" in Axiom, but that's
  not quite true: it's meaning within SPAD is compatible with Aldor's meaning,
  namely "constant assingment": functions in Aldor and SPAD are constants, and
  the usage

  f(1)==1; f(2)==1; f(n)==f(n-1)+f(n-2)

  is only possible in the interpreter -- and that's a wise decision, too, as
  Christian Aistleitner confirmed.

That's a bit of a drive for me, but I think I can make it.  I'll try to

Dear Bill, Gaby and Waldek!

lest my recent rant stirs bad emotions, I'd like to send the three of you a

                               BIG  "THANK YOU!"

for your work on making axiom available and stable!  Sometimes I am very
impatient, and in fear I become even more impatient and more uneasy.

Also, especially Waldek earns another

                               BIG  "THANK YOU!"

for succeeding in making my guessing package available, even if Neil Sloane was
unable to build it, for whatever reason.

I am very much indebted,

Martin

Well, to be fair it was lispnyc that was the "parent" project supporter
- if we are going to ask them to support an Axiom project it's only
reasonable to expect their potentital students to be looking for
"lispy" projects.

Just as another data point - Maxima has not qualified as an SoC mentor
on its own.  In one sense it might have an easier time being a
sub-project of lispnyc than Axiom in that the hurdles to jump through
to get working on it are lower (runs on more common lisps, for one
thing) but I didn't seen any such projects.

I think that's a problem with many potential Axiom projects.  I know I
certainly don't have enough knowledge currently to act as a mentor.

Most of our projects are going to be like that, unless we are looking
for some more "general purpose" lisp library we can make use of.

Hard to say.  Done well I'm sure it would be, but it is not a simple
job.  I am not sure how many of the projects Axiom needs at the lisp
level at this stage are good summer projects.

If I may ask, what applications would they be likely to use Axiom for?

One question - as I understand it, AXIOMsys works on Windows but the
parent program axiom does not.  Would a HyperDoc for Windows also
require a new communications mechanism?  Doing this straight from lisp
(ala hunchentoot or something similar) would be my preference, but
again it's probably not simple.

In this problem being on a non-ANSI lisp without the support of most of
the library of Lisp goodies available today hurts.

Has anyone attempted ANY SPAD compiler hacking as yet?  To the best of
my knowledge that area is almost completely uncharted waters.

Martin, is the most important thing for you to have available a Windows
binary with the Guess package successfully installed?  I can see where
we might be able to put together a NSIS based installer of a merger of
the latest build-improvements, the Guess package and maybe Emacs as a
GUI for Windows, if that would help, but getting to the point where we
can be reasonably sure of not running into the same sort of issue that
originally caused the problems with the Guess package is (IMO) a ways
down the road.  (Not that I'm qualified to have an opinion - Tim, Gaby,
or Waldek would be a much better source.)  I might be able to take a
stab at compiling a Windows release, but I'd be starting from square
one and I'm not completely sure I'll have access to a Windows box.  If
that would be a very significant help, I will look into it - let me
know.

Cheers,
CY

I am sorry Martin. I recall clearly the SOC wiki page you created
but I do not recall your request for mentors, as such. Certainly
I was willing. In fact a couple of weeks later when Hoew asked me
if the Axiom project was interested in participating in SOC via
LispNYC, I immediately said "yes!" and in that case I did register
online with Google as a mentor under the LispNYC project, but I
did not have to supply Hoew directly with my Google email account. 
Perhaps there was some misunderstanding of the requirements?

I added two new items to your SOC 2007 page which were specifically
directed at people with Lisp experience as soon as Hoew invited us
to participate.

Why do you say that? Have you looked at the code that Kai produced?
I would say that the fact that we are not yet using any of this code
is not related to Kai's effort at all. I counted it as successful
because at least he showed that it was possible to work with Axiom
using common lisp tools and how to adapt Axiom's boot code to better
interface with an externally supplied user interface based on a web
browser. Personally I think that was a lot to accomplish during one
summer project.

I would be useful. In fact we already have at least two people doing
that: Gaby and Waldek - although that is not their only objective.

I never said that. I think that C.Y. might have argued that in
another email. I also do not agree with that. What I said was that
there are first of all only a few students currently interested in
Lisp and of those there seem to be only a few who are interested
in Axiom. In fact the only proposals that LispNYC did receive that
could be considered related to Axiom did not even seem to realize
that what they were proposing was already a basic part of Axiom!
I replied to these applicants and at least one of them has since
joined the Axiom developer email list.

I disagree. From other emails from Ondrej it is clear that SymPy
also was only an "add-on" to three separate Python-oriented projects. 
It seems to me that the attention that SymPy got was directly
related to SymPy's association with these projects.

I would be glad to help. I would be VERY GOOD to have Sloane a
supporter of Axiom and I would really hate to lose your input to
the Axiom project.

Tim Daly reported successfully building HyperDoc under cygwin on
Windows and accessing it via Xming (an X-windows server for
Windows). I think that it is a real possibility to build both
HyperDoc and Axiom graphics under cygwin in this manner. Cygwin
is a "unix emulator" for windows. GCL however currently only
builds under MSYS/MinGW which a native Windows build environment. 
Requiring both cygwin and MSYS/MinGW to build Axiom on Windows is
a bit of a heavy requirement but it is possible. 

I use Xming together with Putty on Windows to access HyperDoc
on a unix host all the time. I works great for me. So if this
was also the way we accessed HyperDoc and Axiom Graphics on
Windows I would be quite happy. 

It is currently quite easy (but not for the "turn-key faint-of-
heart) to run Axiom on a virtual machine runing Linux under
Windows. Some people use VMware but I am particularly fond of
Microsoft's own free virtual server environment. It runs SuSE
10.2 for me under Windows XP on a dual processor AMD 4300+
machine very nicely. If I want to, I can use Putty and Xming to
access Axiom in this environment although in this case it is
easier (if you know linux) just to run a standard Linux windows
like gnome in the virtual machine. 

If anyone wants details about running Axiom in this way under
Windows, I would be glad to discuss it. 

> * a free Aldor, or, since this is quite unlikely to happen,

I still think it is possible. Please keep up the pressure however
you can. Most recently (two weeks ago) it was publicly promised
by Steven Watt that there would be some news within a week. 
But we are still waiting ...

I think it would be great if you and other members of the "Species
project" could find a way to make your work more visible (and
therefore more interesting) to others. I still do not completely
understand the objectives and what has been accomplished so far.

I think that is basically correct however you do realize that Aldor
was specifically designed to be the replacement for SPAD, so this
relationship to SPAD is not at all unexpected.

I would not anticipate any problems at all - especially if we
can merge changes from wh-sandbox back into build-improvements.

I hope Martin says "yes". Surely you can find a Windows box down
at the K-mart for not much money. ;) And I as I have said several
times before: I have done this before and I would be very glad
to help someone do it again.

Although that would be nice, it won't help too much.  A functional HyperDoc (or
a HyperDoc replacement) is a must, because, how do you expect an MS Windows
user (used to clicking on buttons) to find out how to express and solve an ODE?
I guess, you won't teach him how to use asq or, gasp!, grep?

If you do put together a new windows binary (and: please do!), and if you want
to include my package, please note that its most recent version depends on
several algebra fixes currently only applied to wh-sandbox.

Therefore, I guess it would be more useful (especially for non-windows
developers) to help Gaby and Waldek merge there distributions (although I must
admit that I do not even know what functionality of build-improvements is
missing from wh-sandbox).

Do you think it would be possible to bundle this up in a (albeit huge) package,
that works more or less out of the box? (However, again: it makes sense only if
HyperDoc browse works)

This would be WONDERFUL!

You see, I'm a bit reluctant to drive people into developing HyperDoc too much,
since what I really want is a bit different. (namely, a HyperDoc replacement
running on any good internet browser, having the functionality of HyperDoc but
moreover understanding documentation written in LaTeX with ALLPROSE / aldoc
conventions.)

But if it is not tooooo big a project, such a bundle would be, again:
WONDERFUL.

What I suggested was a possible cause of the SoC result - that there
are very few students interested in CAS work. I also mentioned that I
was only listing possible causes without having data to back them up. 
I am not arguing that IS the case, only suggesting it as a possible
casue of lack of SoC interest (if it WERE true, it would explain it - I
do not know if it is true.)  From our standpoint, lack of CAS interest
vs. lack of Axiom/Lisp interest would look pretty much the same in
terms of project results.

Right.

Well, that's good news.

OK.  I am of the opinion that, given the already large size of Axiom,
it is worth bundling a binary of Emacs and making that the default UI
unless/until something better becomes available.  Anyone else have an
opinion on that one?

We are long overdue for a Windows release.  I might be able to get
access to a box in about 3 weeks, and if I can I'll set up an Axiom
build environment and take a stab at it.  I'm a Linux guy myself but we
really need something newer than the current binary...

well, the trouble really is: in what sense do you expect aldor to be open
source? would you be happy if it was open source but without granting the right
for redistribution?  I expect something of this sort.  And, although I believe
that this would still be great, I also believe that in this case it would be
better to have a free implementation of the Aldor language, too, even if it
implements only a subset and is, say, much slower.

This model works very well in the Lisp world, and it would prevent another
MuPAD catastrophy from happening...

There are two developers: Ralf and me. We do have at least two advisors:
Nicolas Thiery for maths and design and Christian Aistleitner for Aldor.

> I still do not completely understand the objectives and what has been

We implemented Andre Joyal's theory of "Combinatorial Species", as developed by
Francois Bergeron, Gilbert Labelle and Pierre Leroux

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_species

in a *very* mathematical manner.  In one sentence: a species is a collection of
labelled objects, closed under relabelling.

I.e., to define binary trees (the labels are on the leaves) they write:

        B = X + B*B

and we write

        macro {
                CS == CombinatorialSpecies;
                X == SingletonSpecies;
        }
        B(L: LabelType): CS L == Plus(X, Times(B, B))(L) add;

I hope, you see the similarity.  To define forests of binary trees we continue
with

        F(L: LabelType): CS L == Compose(SetSpecies, B)(L) add;

So far we can 

* generate exhaustively the structures - and also use them, i.e., for example,
  write a function that computes the height of a given tree.

* experimentally, generate exhaustively the isomorphismtypes of the structures.
  For example, we can generate all set partitions, but also all integer
  partitions.

* compute the generating function (in the sense of a lazy stream) for the
  structures, the isomorphismtypes, but also a formal power series that
  generalises these two generating functions, namely, the cycle index series.

Our next goals are

* extend to multisorted species, i.e., species where the labels are structured
  according to colour

and maybe

* investigate vectorial species, i.e., functors from the category of finite
  sets into the category of finite dimensional vector spaces

* investigate whether we can compute the molecular expansion of a species

Arrgh.  In other words, we still couldn't integrate it into the Axiom
system?

> I expect something of this sort.

While of course it is the right of the copyright holders to do as they
see fit, I'd be curious as to what they would expect to gain from this
move.  As you mention below:

> it would be better to have a free implementation of the Aldor
> language, too, even if it implements only a subset and is, say,
> much slower.

SPAD will probably become that, if it must.  Which would pretty much
leave Aldor where it is now - is there another potential large scale
application for the Aldor language that can't be adequately filled by
O'Caml, Haskell, or one of the other such languages available today?

There are some potentially interesting long term projects that could be
investigated with either SPAD or Aldor in terms of integrating proof
systems with Axiom, and the flexibility to work deeply with the
language implementation and even the language definition itself could
wind up being important.  Either way, something definite on Aldor would
be nice - even if we find out for sure we can't use it at least we
could then devote time to SPAD knowing we wouldn't have the rug yanked
out from under us by an Aldor release (i.e. it would be work we do
actually need to do and couldn't avoid by waiting).

Cheers,
CY

That might be technically possible but large doesn't even begin to
describe it.  At that point we might as well think about bundling a live
ISO with an emulator and do things that way - it would probably be simpler.

Keep in mind that this would be an X Windows application under Microsoft
Windows, and would not match at all closely the look and feel of any
normal Windows application.  Also, it may conflict with existing
cygwin/X setups - not sure about that.

I don't quite know about the technical difficulty, as it's been a while
since I have dealt with any of these systems.  I would expect such a
bundle to be HUGE.

If we can successfully release a "normal" Windows binary perhaps we can
look next at bundling cygwin and X for an "all-in-one" type release.

At this point, there is no much to improve at the boot/lisp internals
per see.  But, you definitely want to integrate the new parser into
the compiler and share more between in the intepreter and the
compiler. 

Also, people should really look at the trace file and try to correct
the algebra files -- there are quite a few bugs there.

I see no fundamental reason why both process should not be threads in

Notice that if you use sockets, the the anti-virus firewall will
consider Axiom as a program that wants access to network and it might
be blocked; then the anti-virus will ask you whether you want to grant
access or not.  That is silly.

I believe we must not underestimate people's time.  If it does not

occassions. This is partly why I'm spending so much resource in
simplifying the build machinery; and I hope it does not get lost
because the Axiom community is unfocused -- even though it is a very

For my class using Axiom to "succeed", I need an Axiom that does not

No. Let's be clear. The *build* environment would require both
cygwin and MSYS/MinGW. That is large but not huge. I run both of
these easily in my usual Windows development environment.

But the *run-time* (binary) environment would not be much bigger
than the current Linux and Windows binaries. Applications built
with cygwin require only the presence of the cygwin dll library.
There used to be a license issue about distributing packages
containing only that part of cygwin - I am not sure if that is
still the case or not - but in any case requiring that the user
install a minimal cygwin environment as a prerequiste is not all
that bad. Applications built with MSYS/MinGW on the other hand
run natively on Windows and do not require any extra specially
licensed libraries.

cygwin provides a online download and update facility similar
to Debian apt-get, so if it was possible to package Axiom for
cygwin this way, it would make it very easy for Windows users
to install Axiom.

A live ISO that will boot under VMware was developed by Alfredo
and is already available. See

In principle it would be easy to create a new DoyenCD with
Axiom compiled from wh-sandbox which would already contain
Martin's guess package.

That is true, however Xming integrates very well with Windows
in my opinion. The X managed windows appear along with the
windows managed directly by Microsoft Windows. It is true
that they have an "odd" menu system by Windows standards but
in other respects they look familiar.

No, I don't think so. But in general I avoid running the
X windows server under cygwin. I like Xming much better.

No, I don't agree. It is not likely to be any bigger than the
existing HyperDoc application under Linux - smaller perhaps
because the web browser itself would presumably be just be an
easily satisfied pre-requisite, i.e. all Windows users have at
least IExplorer and FireFox is very easy it acquire.

That's the easy part. Finding a way to build HyperDoc and
Axiom Graphics as cygwin applications while running AXIOMsys
as a native application with the right support for sockets
might be the hard part.

Currently AXIOMsys can only be built using gcl on windows. The only
available version of gcl for windows is built as a native windows application
using MSYS/MinGW. There is an experimental version of Axiom built
with SBCL for Windows by Gregory Vanuxem but as far as I know it
does not include socket support. For that matter, neither does the
gcl version of Axiom for windows. Axiom has it's own routines written
in C that provide the socket interface and so far this has not been
incorporated into the version of Axiom for Windows. 

If by "parent program" you mean "sman" and "session"? Since these are
C programs there is no good reason not be able to compile them under
either cygwin or MSYS/MinGW (native windows). The trick is to get the
right support for sockets.  On the other hand, 'hyperdoc' and 'graphics'
both require X-windows. This is something that (as far as I know) is only
available under cygwin.

That is correct however historically Axiom was designed at a time when
there was not thread suppor under unix (or what ever Axiom was built
on at that time) and it was still considered "pretty neat" to get this stuff
working via sockets. So I would call it legacy rather than over engineering.

There are X servers for Windows other than cygwin but I believe they
are all commercial - nor do I know if we could successfully work with
them.  The correct approach here is to work with some cross platform
toolkit and avoid the need for an X server, but that will take time
:-(.  Socket support on Windows should be possible - IIRC Maxima makes
use of this.

It helps in at least one respect - threads in lisp are not universal
between implementations and platforms, and if thread support is not
robust depending on it is a bit risky.  Sockets are at least universal
and flexible.  My understanding was GCL does not currently support
threads - has this changed?  What about on Windows and Linux?  How
about Solaris and MacOSX?  SBCL has threads on Linux and I think they
are either close or there on Windows (with what level of robustness I
don't know.)  CMUCL has threads on x86, but I'm not sure about other
platforms.  Other lisps I don't know - IIRC Clisp does not have
threads.  If we decide to go only with SBCL we might be able to use
threads only but sockets should work virtually anywhere.

Also, what about situations where (for example) someone wants to run
the Axiom kernel on a dedicated machine and the interface on another
machine?  Sockets are ideal for this sort of situation.

Yes, XMaxima and possible WxMaxima have that problem on Windows. 
Normally it is dealt with once and then works fine from there on.  I
agree it is annoying but I'm not convinced that issue in and of itself
it is sufficient reason to abandon sockets.  Or perhaps there is some
other inter-process communication mechanism we could take advantage of
that doesn't involve sockets and their firewall issues (does
Mathematica's MathLink have firewall problems?  I don't know.)

Thread support is still spotty between implementations and platforms. 
I would say use it if available, but don't depend on it as a do-or-die
feature.  Couldn't we do something like:

Start Axiom GUI ->  If threads, start new thread with kernel
                    If no threads, start new process with kernel

No. I meant X-windows *client* support, i.e. the X libraries and associated
machinery. Both hyperdoc and graphics require this X-windows client
support.

The X server component is no problem. A good free X server is provided
by Xming on Windows:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming

I would not recommend running the X server component under cygwin.
I've tried it and I think it sucks. If you really want this, then I think you
really want Linux.

I am not convinced that this is the correct approach. It works for
some, e.g. GIMP, but it still looks ugly to me. I am much more
in favor of the web-browser-as-gui solution for cross platform
support. But both of these are too much work for the resources
we have available right now.

> :-(.  Socket support on Windows should be possible - IIRC

Certainly GCL supports sockets on Windows. No problem. But
Axiom rolls it's own socket support, so linking it into GCL on
Windows is a little technically challenging (but not too difficult,
I think). But probably it would be better to modify AXIOM to use
the socket support built in to Lisp (GCL).

Neat!  Clearly I'm behind on the state of the art in free Windows X servers.

Agreed - that was the context I was originally considering for X
Hyperdoc on Windows.  Xming changes things.

GIMP uses GTK, which I agree is not very good for a native Windows look
and feel.  TK with the Tile extensions is somewhat better, and there are
other alternatives as well (QT is excellent, but does not have robust
lisp bindings).  The Right Way to do native behavior would be a robust
McCLIM with native backends for each platform, but that is likely many
man-years of work away :-(.

In theory, a proper communications API would allow browsers, GUIs, and
anything else to communicate with the same core with minimal trouble -
IIRC Kai and I agreed that was a logical point to focus initial efforts,
the last time the issue came up.

Agreed.  Maybe an overlay to hide implementation specific socket APIs
would be good, but I'm not familiar with the options except knowing
about the existence of usocket:  http://common-lisp.net/project/usocket/
 Apparently GCL is not on the usocket list yet.

Yes, I also think that this is a great problem, although it is a problem of all
packages developed by people in their spare time or as a hobby.

For this reason I started the axiom workshops together with Ralf, and tried
hard to make them VERY focussed. If the coming workshop is as successful as the
last in terms of resulting code, it would be wonderful.


Waldek, Gaby, maybe you could spend a minute explaining in what ways
build-improvements and wh-sandbox differ. I have the impression that wh-sandbox
covers most if not all of build-improvements.  Is this incorrect?  If not, why
do you want to merge things back from wh-sandbox into build-improvements and
not the other way round?

I believe wh-sandbox does not contain all of build-improvements as
evidenced by the recent experiment of Bill and Waldek.  It is hard for
me tell which is which because when the changes are merged to
wh-sandbox, the ChangeLog does not contain proper labels, which
changes are taken, which are left out, etc and the rationale.  Waldek
knows best all the details. 

Furthermore, in any sane development development environment, when you
create a branch B from a tree A, you regularly merge from A to B, not
to lose track.  And other branches are created as well from A, so it
is simpler to merge back to A to minimize conflicts, manual
resolutions etc.  That is why, for example I try to make sure
gdr-sandbox does not stay too far from build-improvements.  Anything
else tend to create unnecessary work -- I don't know for others, but I
don't enough time to spend solving problems I could avoid in the first
place.

gloops; I meant "postpar.boot" changes only.  As is the tree cannot
build.

There is a bug in c-util.boot that I wanted to correct before adding
the changes that make it compilable with bootsys.=20=20
I should not commit to Axiom early in the morning before enough
coffee.

I'll notify you when I reinstate the tree in a good shape.  Sorry for
the inconvenience.

Concerning parts of build-improvements included in wh-sandbox let
me repeat (with little correction) what I wrote in another mail:

The src/boot directory and src/scripts/document.in is synced with
build improvements 485.
In src/interp and src/algebra I belive that I picked all changes
that I now want to go into wh-sandbox -- in this sense both directories
are synced, but differences are significant (I may use some changes later
but ATM other changes conflict with my work).  Other directories
(src/lib, src/clef, src/sman, src/graph, src/hyper) were synced 
with build improvements 358 and need re-syncing.

In particular many portability improvements to build-improvements
are still not merged.

If you look at line counts (and skip genereated files) probably the
biggest part of build-improvements not include in wh-sandbox is in
src/interp/Makefile.pamphlet and src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet.  ATM
this difference is intentional, algebra build in wh-sandbox is quite
different then in build-improvements, and in interp Makefile I belive
that wh-sandbox has similar functionality as build-improvements, but
the Makefile is simpler.

I intend to merge other changes but I considered wholesale merge
inpractical (it would generate too much breakage).  So my tactic
was to merge configure part (most other changes depend on configure),
boot part (easy to do and needed for my other work), and 
interp changes (needed to avoid major breakage).  In principle
merging the other part should be now easier, but there are
some conflicts there...

What wh-sandbox has which is not in build-improvements:
1) A lot of unused code is removed from wh-sandbox
2) depsys boot files are converted to shoe (and bootstrap
   Lisp is removed).  IIUC Gaby is doing similar thing
   in build-improvements.
3) new algebra bootstrap
4) many bug fixes

I can now confirm that after removing my unintentional reversion
of 'configure.ac.pamphlet' to build-improvements revision 366 but
keeping the other changes from that revision, wh-sandbox builds
successfully on my Solaris x86 system. 

I would consider the next challenge for portability of wh-sandbox
to be a successful build under Windows. I think this will require
the incorporation of a few more revisions from build-improvements. 

Waldek, I am ready to commit my revisioin 366 based changes
to wh-sandbox. Shall I proceed?

Regards,
Bill Page.

In Axiom version of  1/17/2005

1.4^2  comes out as 1.96

1.96 - 1.4^2  comes out as  0.7 E -20

I don't know if this counts as unexpected to a 5th grader, but does a 
5th grader even know about "E" scientific notation?

Subject: Re: [Maxima] strange behaviour with simple decimals / Axiom
From: Richard Fateman <fateman@cs.berkeley.edu>
To: maxima@math.utexas.edu
In Axiom version of  1/17/2005

1.4^2  comes out as 1.96

1.96 - 1.4^2  comes out as  0.7 E -20

I don't know if this counts as unexpected to a 5th grader, but does a
5th grader even know about "E" scientific notation?

What's his point?

I believe that can explained by the fact that Axiom uses the host
"long double" C datatype for DoubleFloat whereas Maxima must be using
the more conventional and reliable "double" C datatype.

No. By default Axiom uses it's own adjustable precision floating
point. See domain Float and the 'precision()' function. 

If you want DoubleFloat you would write:

(1) -> A:=1.4::DoubleFloat

    (1)  1.3999999999999999
                                       Type: DoubleFloat

(2) -> A^2

    (2)  1.9599999999999997
                                       Type: DoubleFloat

(3) -> B:=1.9599999999999997::DoubleFloat

    (3)  1.9599999999999997
                                       Type: DoubleFloat

(4) -> B-A^2

    (4)  0.0
                                       Type: DoubleFloat

Of the "machine" float:

(5) -> A:=1.4::MachineFloat

    (5)  1.4
                                       Type: MachineFloat

(6) -> A^2

    (6)  1.96
                                       Type: MachineFloat

(7) -> B:=1.96::MachineFloat

    (7)  1.96
                                       Type: MachineFloat

(8) -> B-A^2

    (8)  0.2220446049 250313 E -15
                                       Type: MachineFloat

which agrees with what Maxima computes.

Heh - there's a discussion on the Maxima list about expected behavior
of numerical operations - Jay is discussing whether it would make more
sense to work some calculations in base 10, since things like  

1.96 - 1.4^2 = 2.2204460492503131E-16

are not intuitive to some audiences - exactly 0 would be the expected
response.  (Personally, I can see his point.)  Axiom came up when the
topic got to comparative behavior of CASs and calculators.  I don't
think there is a criticism of Axiom involved as such, the discussion is
more general than that.

Cheers,
CY

I looked around and asked on #lisp (thank y'all on #lisp for correcting
my ignorance about such basic matters).  The upshot appears to be that
sockets are sufficiently useful to be worth dealing with the firewall
issues.  This page was mentioned as a useful introduction to the
options available: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-process_communication  A couple of
the general protocols have lisp implementations (CORBA: 
http://clorb.sourceforge.net/ and XML-RPC: 
http://common-lisp.net/project/s-xml-rpc/) but as far as I can tell
both involve MORE overhead than sockets, not less.  A real local
alternative to sockets for inter-process communication would probably
need to involve pipes or file operations, either one of which I would
worry about for portability.  I would disagree with the
characterization of socket use in Axiom as over-engineering - I think
the client-server setup adds useful flexibility, and sockets appear to
be the Right Way to implement it.

I do agree that threads are a more attractive way to implement the
client-server setup when dealing with a strictly local copy of Axiom,
and they might be more available than I previously thought.  The
closest thing to useful information I have dug up thus far are these
sites:

http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/
http://wiki.alu.org/Portable_Threads

While I don't know how current or comprehensive the information there
is (SBCL's support status has recently changed, according to nyef on
#lisp), they do suggest thread support might be fairly widely available
in some form.  Of course, that still doesn't help us with GCL...

I would say the thing to do is this:

Allow Axiom to have both local and remote interface clients.  The
default would be a local client, with remote connections being handled
as options.  The flow would be something like this:

1)  User starts Axiom client, default settings.
2)  Client checks for thread support.
    a.  If available, start new thread with kernel
    b.  If not available, start new process with kernel on default
socket.
3)  If process is available in in-image thread, use local calls for IO.
 If not, send them over the socket.  This should be abstracted and be
simply a matter of defining a few settings/variables.

To handle the issue of firewall interaction, I would suggest
investigating if the NSIS installer can prompt the user to add the
Axiom client and server programs to the Windows Firewall allowed list,
and perhaps open the needed port as well.  I'm not sure if this
functionality is defined there currently but it might be worth
suggesting, as I doubt Axiom and Maxima would be the only open source
programs to confront this issue.  It would also be a good idea to make
sure our error messages are informative in the case of failure to
connect, and provide all available information for resolving the
issues.

Cheers,
CY

I tried to configure gcl, which a collegue fetched yesterday via

svn co https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements/gcl gcl

Unfortunately it (i.e., configure) fails

Many many thanks in advance,

Martin

same problem in build-improvements.

I realized that binutils-dev and m4 was not installed, I installed those, no
change, unfortunately.

After installing binutils-dev and m4 configure worked. Now it's making...

Shouldn't configure fail more gracefully?

                                                 ^^^^^

GCL was compiled with xgcl support therefore it needs X development
libraries for creating a new image via compiler::link. The best thing
would be to use another version of GCL (without xgcl support), the other
way is to install libxmu-dev (if package installation is possible). For
information, if you encounter any other errors of this type here is the
list of the (names of package) development libraries that should be
needed. It is derived from the list of libraries GCL is linked against :

libsm-dev: /usr/lib/libSM.a
libsm-dev: /usr/lib/libSM.so
libice-dev: /usr/lib/libICE.a
libice-dev: /usr/lib/libICE.so
libxmu-dev: /usr/lib/libXmu.a
libxmu-dev: /usr/lib/libXmu.so
libxmuu-dev: /usr/lib/libXmuu.a
libxmuu-dev: /usr/lib/libXmuu.so
libxt-dev: /usr/lib/libXt.a
libxt-dev: /usr/lib/libXt.so
libxtst-dev: /usr/lib/libXtst.a
libxtst-dev: /usr/lib/libXtst.so
libxext-dev: /usr/lib/libXext.a
libxext-dev: /usr/lib/libXext.so
libxaw7-dev: /usr/lib/libXaw7.a
libxaw7-dev: /usr/lib/libXaw7.so
libxaw7-dev: /usr/lib/libXaw.so
libx11-dev: /usr/lib/libX11.a
libx11-dev: /usr/lib/libX11.so
libxau-dev: /usr/lib/libXau.a
libxau-dev: /usr/lib/libXau.so
libxpm-dev: /usr/lib/libXpm.a
libxpm-dev: /usr/lib/libXpm.so
libxdmcp-dev: /usr/lib/libXdmcp.a
libxdmcp-dev: /usr/lib/libXdmcp.so

This information is probably hold in a Lisp variable but I don't know
which one. Waldek could be of better help.


In any case if you pass this phase I hope you'll be able to compile
wh-sandbox. I'm no longer able, a bad interaction between my computer
and GCL is highly probable.

Hope that helps and I'm not wrong,

Greg

If you agree with that, then you must agree with the over-engineering
characterization.  We have more uses of Axiom as local copy than we
have as a truly distributed system over network.  A 101 principle
of engineering is to keep common thing simple.

Oh yes, I know Axiom was designed a long time ago; that does not
change my point.

As Gregory Vanuxem the problem appeared because gcl (more precisely
compiler::link) requires _developement_ versions of X libraries,
but the system contains only normal versions.

I would say that this is a bug in Ubutu gcl package.  AFAICS in
may version of Debian gcl description reads:

Package: gcl
Priority: optional
Section: interpreters
Installed-Size: 160052
Maintainer: Camm Maguire <camm@enhanced.com>

In particular there is no dependency on developement libraries, so
it is passible that current Debian have similar problem.

Please send me your config.log and the exact message of failure and

I meanwhile managed to build gcl from build-improvements (by installing
binutils-dev, and m4), and now wh-sandbox compiles *nearly*.  Now I get these
rather "random" failures, where some of the algebra fails to compile.  I
believe that the first error message was some "memory may be damaged" stuff,
while compiling ALGEBRA.

Didn't Bill Page say that one has to tweak some setting in gcl?

Please, please, please.  General message to people experiencing

   --enable-checking

The build is slower but you may get a chance to make a meaningful
report that may eventually help fix the bug you run into.

Does this work also in wh-sandbox?

after installing binutils-dev, m4, libxpm-dev, libx11-dev, libxt-dev,
libext-dev, libxmu-dev, libxmu-headers

build-improvements succeeded.

I am currently retrying wh-sandbox with --enable-checking.

Thanks for all your help!

No, Gaby added  --enable-checking in version 491 and the latest parts
merged are from 485.

To get extra checking I used code like below (ho.  Her, after 16
hours the build died due to uninitialized variable when compileing
guessing package (I still have to investigate the problem).

OK.

It is not clear to me that wh-sandbox has the --enable-checking
bits.  One drawback of Autoconf design is that when configure does not
understand an --enable-FEATURE switch, it says nothing.

Waldek already stated that it hasn't. 

You see, I really need wh-sandbox because of three reasons:

* HyperDoc "users" and "dependents" works

* there are many algebra bug fixes

* it contains my guessing package

(the last item depends on the second item, but the first item also is extremely
helpful)

A request for both build-improvements and wh-sandbox:

could you please install "document" by default, and include my SPADEDIT file,
which is located at

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/144DomainAbbreviationIsNoLongerAssociatedWithFilename

second comment from below.

I also believe that the installed source files in src/algebra really should be
the ".spad.pamphlet"s, not the ".spad"s

Is there any reason for copying the "spad"s instead?

Thanks for everything,

Martin

I do not doubt wh-sandbox is useful :-)
I believe that part of the HyperDoc and algebra that is known to be
solid and OK should be merged back to build-improvements, while the
other more experimental parts can remain in wh-sandbox until
consolidated. 

Ideally, all of this should be merged back to silver, but I don't know
what Silver is.  I would hate to change target every two or three
months.

There is a good reason to run other processes in separate address
space: Lisp garbage collector.  This places significant restrictions
on possible interface between C and Lisp.  According to Camm Maguire
Gcl has additional problem: C malloc may trigger garbage collection.
So passing unbouded amount of data to C becomes almost impossible
(one can use  GCLspecific method to reqest storage which in not
moved by garbage collection, but that is awkward and hurts
performance).

Other Lisp may also place restrictions on possible behaviour of C
code.  Socket interface seem to be accepted way to interface
general programs with Lisp (and other high level runtimes).

Yes, if the collector is designed to be uncoperative -- yes.
But "garbage collector" in itself is not a reason.
If you take the flash media player for example, it has
a garbage collector, but is does run in environment that do use
expect garbage collection. Many other projects do the same.

Be liberal in what you accept and conservative in what you deliver.
That was known engineering principle decades ago.

For some reasons, I've been exposed to all the intricate details
of garbage collector I did not want to know -- and some I wanted to
know, because we are considering Programmer Controlled Garbage
Collection for C++ and we have to solve issues related to
combining component that can leave with GC, those that prohibit it,
and those that require it.

In the FRISCO projects, we had components that were GC'd and some that
aren't.

Not that much.

Install it where?
I consider installing it in $prefix/bin an unwarranted  pollution.
We can install it in $libdir and add an option "--document" to the
axiom script, e.g. you could say

   axiom --document=tangle foo.pamphlet

that will untangle the SPAD code.  We may add more options as
we have better idea of what to support.

This is something I planned to do, but so far, it wasn't high
on the priority list.

that would be OK, although I'd prefer

  axiom --document foo.pamphlet

(I know I'd forget the tangle all the time.)

Maybe even

  axiom foo.pamphlet

but no, that's confusing...

At the moment yes, but the future is unknown.  It is far easier to
design the system from the beginning to be flexible (client-server) and
then not use that ability.  Otherwise we might have to go back and do a
major redesign.  In my opinion the flexibility to have a non-local copy
of Axiom is worthwhile.  

I can't speak to this since I don't know the history, but I would not
be surprised to learn that thread support was not a viable option when
the original design was done, and since what was done worked no one
revisited the decisions until now.

> A 101 principle of engineering is to keep common thing simple.

Sockets seem to be a minor detail to me (not technically, perhaps) -
basically one more way to implement a client-server mechanism in
addition to threads/pipes/what have you.  You have worked more with the
code than I have - how much complexity does it really add?  What would
you propose that would be simpler without being less robust as well? 
My original impression of threads in lisp was that support was not
broadly developed and robust.  That may have changed since, but I would
want more information than I have now before I would be willing to
regard thread support in Lisp as something to depend on.

Thread support in lisp implementations is not usually described as
basic, in my experience... maybe to use but certainly not to implement.

Do you mean the CURRENT implementation of things in Axiom is not well
engineered, irrespective of the use of sockets?

I'll take a crack at NSIS once I have a Windows box available.

Cheers,
CY

P.S.  I don't mean to be an irritation, Gaby - it's possible I'm just
lacking enough basic understanding to follow you correctly.  Is there
some introductory material on thread vs. socket issues that I could read?

X11 is a socket-based design. When we tried to write graphics
(actually it was originally in X10) we needed to use sockets.
Given that the graphics had sockets it made sense to communicate
from Axiom to the graphics component using the same protocol.

On one system (axiom-developer.org) which is configured with a
variant of RedHat 9 as a shared virtual server - don't know
many more details than that - I have found that is necessary
to change the GCLOPTS so that --max-page is a little less than
256*1024 (I use 192*1024 on axiom-developer.org). If this doesn't
work, then I suggest to try configure with this number a little
larger - maybe 320*1024. In general GCL seems to depend very
strongly on the detailed memory management features of those
operating systems on which it runs. This and the specific code
relocation method is the what changes most from machine to
machine.

Regards,
Bill Page.

If you can't handle the known present, how do you plan to handle the

Please, note that "client-server" does not necessarily imply sockets,
and using threads does not necessarily exclude "client-server".

However, my fundamental point remains: common things should be simple.

I think we should be careful about the arguments we make.

Well, my initial comment is more a statement about the current state
as opposed to an active suggestion to redesign Axiom.  Certainly, we
have around Lisp systems mapping to threads and using them.  They
don't look more complicated than the current mess we have.  Now, you
may have a point about standard thread interface, but that is more of
a general problem with Lisp environments once you start doing anything
useful -- you have to catter for all kinds of variabilities.

OK, personally, I only use "document", from within emacs (I made it a command
in AucTeX), so it produces the spad and the dvi.

Since I strongly believe that we should switch to ALLPROSE as soon as possible,
(which will replace "document" with "make") I won't insist on anything.

Thus, I think that

  axiom --document=tangle foo.pamphlet

is quite ok.

We can simplify the switches if we are willing to use the same
switches as document itself.

Axiom Developers;

As motivation for further "sole searching" concerning the
minimal interest in Axiom expressed by Summer of Code
applicants to LispNYC (which very generously included Axiom
in it's list of possible projects), I am forwarding the
following email concerning SymPy. As you will read, a total
of 5 applications were accepted for SymPy related projects!

But first I would like to sincerely congratulate Ondrej Certik
for obtaining such a large response to the SymPy project. I
think that this is an encouraging sign that there is indeed
still a lot of interest in computer algebra/symbolic compuation
on the part of computer sciene students. I wish him and the
participants in the SOC 2007 projects the the greatest success.
I plan to continue to monitor the SymPy project and update the
version of SymPy that is accessible on the Axiom Wiki:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSymPy

I don't see this as in conflict with any objectives of the
Axiom project and in fact I hope that we can continue to
collaborate to the greatest extent possible. Axiom developers
can contribute just by trying examples online or by downloading
and testing SymPy locally on their own computers and reporting
problems as usual to the SymPy developers. I believe that
Ondrej is subscribed to this Axiom email list, but obviously
he may be a little too busy with details of the Sympy projects
to contribute much to our discussion here. :-)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hi all,

thanks to all of you for participating in the GSoC. As I wrote, we
got 11 applications in total and 5 were selected (congratulations
to Mateusz, Robert, Brian, Chris and Jason!), so it's a huge success,
I didn't expect that.

You can check it here:

http://code.google.com/soc/psf/about.html
http://code.google.com/soc/stsci/about.html
http://code.google.com/soc/psu/about.html

Thanks also to Mladen, Marc-Etienne and George, even though you
weren't selected, you still helped SymPy a lot just by applying a
high quality application. Because that's better than any other
advertising.

The technical issues with those selected will be done later, don't
worry about it now. I'll be in touch.

Ondrej

Do you mean 

  axiom --tangle foo.pamphlet 

?

Would

  axiom foo.pamphlet

then do the same as currently 

  document foo.pamphlet

?

I'd rather have

  axiom --document=tangle foo.pamphlet

tangle foo.pamphlet

  axiom --document foo.pamphlet

be equivalent to current
  
  document foo.pamphlet

and

  axiom foo.pamphlet

show a usage message just as axiom -h.

Agreed.  My understanding was that it was the use of sockets itself
which you were objecting to.  Maxima's socket mechanism is both
effective and extremely simple, if I remember correctly.  I can see
where Axiom's CURRENT use of the idea may be suboptimal.

I will have to take a closer look at that aspect of the code - that is
surprising to me.  Of course, Maxima is a simple two way communication
and Axiom seems to communicate between core, graphics, and hyperdoc all
at once...

OK, that's probably true.

Also true, but my expectation would be that sockets are more likely to
be available and robust in a given case than threads.  I admit I do not
have the facts in hand to justify that expectation.

I misunderstood your original objection - I thought sockets applied to
Axiom in any fashion was a problem.  It sounds more like the way we
CURRENTLY do things isn't so good regardless of mechanism, and that's a
different sort of issue.  I'm surprised that this aspect of Axiom is
complex, so there are clearly some design issues I'm not taking into
account yet.

I'm objecting to unconditional use of "sockets" because they might
better handle the future.  

I think most of my objections are qualified :-)

Well, they are not outstandingly complex, but they do add complexity.
When you try to port Axiom to say, ECL, SBCL, CLISP, etc. that added
complexity becomes non-negligeable.  Since, I've been doing that, I
think I let my exasperation out.

For example.

| 
| ?

 (1) latex the foo.tex

|   
|   document foo.pamphlet
| 
| and
| 
|   axiom foo.pamphlet
| 
| show a usage message just as axiom -h. 

I would also like to be able to dump intermediate representation,
compile to machine objects or FASLs, create a standalone executable.

I'd go for the 

axiom --document=tangle foo.pamphlet
axiom --document foo.pamphlet

version.  But do as you wish.  In any case, please install ".spad.pamphlet"
instead of ".spad" into src/algebra.  There is quite a bit of documented
algebra source meanwhile.

Ah :-).  No problem - I FULLY understand that issue ;-).  API
differences without compelling motivation seem to be a hobby of free
lisp implementations...  One question - where is most of the code for
Axiom's use of sockets, in the lisp image or sman?  That task sounds
like one where the usocket library would be (or at least should be)
very helpful, although I suppose the C code makes assumptions that make
life difficult...

Axiom is not good at using existing libraries for this sort of thing,
probably because a) most don't seem to work on GCL and b) it was
written before most of them were available.  I think if we can make use
of those libraries (distribute them with Axiom if need be) we should be
able to make a lot of this sort of thing a LOT better, much more
easily.  (And I still think such an improved situation would mean more
interest from other Lisp projects...)

A long time back we had the discussion somewhere (as a project) about
the merits of selecting one lisp implementation as opposed to
supporting many.  I'm beginning to see the other side of that argument
more and more, although I think sbcl would be a better choice if 1 lisp
had to be chosen...  My hope is that once we ARE working on ANSI lisps
and perhaps using some of the "make life easier" libraries like CFFI
and usocket matters will remain much simpler going forward.  One can
hope anyway...

Cheers, and thanks for all the hard work you've been doing!

Dear Tim, Waldek,

I'm currently experimenting with libdb.text files generated by aldor when
compiling for axiom.

Would you have an idea why

+++   \begin{adusage}
+++     x: \adthistype{} :=
\adname[CombinatorialSpeciesCategory]{cycleIndexSeries}$\adtype{SetSpecies}(Integer);
+++     k: MachineInteger := 3;

+++   \end{adusage}%$
+++   \begin{addescription}{Stretch a \useterm{cycle index series}.}

+++     \begin{gather*}
+++       f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)
+++     \end{gather*}
+++     the function returns a \emph{stretched} series $g$
+++     \begin{gather*}
+++       g = \sum_{n=0}^\infty f_n(x_k,x_{2k},\ldots,x_{nk}).
+++     \end{gather*}
+++   \end{addescription}
+++   \begin{adremarks}
+++     This functions respects the fact that
+++     \adcode$\adname[FormalPowerSeriesCategory]{coefficient}(g,n)$

+++     returns a sequence with gaps of size $k-1$ between actual non-zero

+++   \end{adremarks}


in the aldor source would be transformed into 

ostretch`2`x`(_$,ACMachineInteger)->_$`dCycleIndexSeries``\begin{adusage}

in libdb.text?

(The line breaks are OK, but the minus signs in

\end{gather----------------*}      the function returns a \emph{stretched}

and

e with gaps o--f --si--ze-- $--k---1$-- b--etween actual non-zero

are terrible!

Some hints:

in the asy file, everything is still ok:

                (|symeNameCode| . 798514742)
                (|symeTypeCode| . 622595490)))

              ((|documentation| .
                  "   \\begin{adusage}

   \\begin{addescription}{Stretch a \\useterm{cycle index series}.}

   \\end{adremarks}
")

Also the version in libcombinatax.al is fine.  I could not find any other files
that contain the docstring.

The libdb is created magically when I first )lib the compiled files

Any insight would be great,

Martin

Do you know which part (i.e., boot or lisp function) is responsible for
creating libdb.text?

I guess it is created from the asy file, but even that I do not know.

OK, that one is pretty sure now.  Furthermore, it seems that minus signs start
always after exactly 500 characters, however, the number of minus signs
appearing at this position varies. After 500 more characters, I get minus signs
again, but there may be some other characters inbetween, as here:

(unfortunately, copy pasting modifies some characters, so the positions are not
exact anymore below)

Look at the function writedb in br-data.boot.pamphlet.  It looks that
this function is resposible for mangling you see.

Oh, I should have had the idea to 

grep "500" *.pamphlet

:-)

Any idea what that's good for?  Well, in any case, it will help me a lot to
reach my goal!

Thanks a million times, Waldek!

     ACM SIGPLAN SYMPOSIUM ON LIBRARY-CENTRIC SOFTWARE DESIGN - LCSD'07

                     http://lcsd.cs.tamu.edu/2007

              on October 21st, 2007 at

         Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and =20
Applications
         (OOPSLA'07) conference in Montreal, Canada, October 21-25, 2007

CALL FOR PAPERS

Libraries are central to all major scientific, engineering, and
business areas, yet the design, implementation, and use of libraries
are underdeveloped arts. This symposium is one of the first steps in
the process of placing all aspects of libraries on a sound technical
and scientific basis through research into fundamental issues and
documentation of best practices.

A software library is an organized collection of code with associated
tools supporting programming in general or in specific domains,
usually united by a specified set of principles and conventions. Most
libraries are aimed for use by several people and in different
environments. The areas of software library research include

     * Design and implementation of libraries
     * Program and system design based on libraries
     * Libraries supporting specific application domains, such as
       biology or banking
     * Evolution, refactoring, and maintenance of libraries
     * Empirical studies of library use
     * Performance of libraries, including benchmarking and
       library-based optimizations
     * Design of language facilities and tools in support of library
       definition and use
     * Validation, debugging, and testing of libraries
     * Extensibility, parameterization, and customization
     * Distribution of libraries
     * Specification of libraries and their semantics
     * Usability for library users and developers
     * Assessing quality of libraries
     * Documentation and teaching of libraries
     * Creating and supporting communities of library users
     * Using several libraries in combination

We invite the submission of papers on software library
research, including, but not limited to, the above list of topics.
The papers should address issues important to libraries as
a field, i.e., describe ideas or techniques that can be reused for
libraries across problem domains and/or languages.

Authors should use the latest ACM SIGS conference
style file (option 1) at
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html. Submissions should
be limited to 12 pages in this style.

Accepted papers will be published in the ACM proceedings for the =20
symposium.

IMPORTANT DATES

Aug 1     Submission of papers
Sep 1     Notification of acceptance
Sep 15    Submission of final versions of the papers
Oct 21    Symposium

In addition, the organizers will serve as program committee members,
with Jaakko J=89rvi and Josh Bloch as program co-chairs.

Primarily, the email address lcsd07@cs.tamu.edu should be used for
questions addressed to the organizers.

KEYNOTE ADDRESS

There will be an invited talk by Doug Lea, State University of New
York at Oswego. Doug Lea is the author of the book "Concurrent
Programming in Java", and co-author of the text "Object-Oriented
System Development". He is the author of several widely used software
packages and components, as well as articles, reports, and
standardization efforts dealing with object oriented software
development including those on specification, design and
implementation techniques, distributed, concurrent, and parallel
object systems, and software reusability.

SYMPOSIUM GOALS AND ACTIVITIES

The symposium is a scientific forum for presenting original
research in the design, implementation, and evaluation of software
libraries. Other major activities include the identification of open
questions specific to library research and the discussion of a
strategic plan for establishing library research as a field. The
outcome of the symposium is a combination of research contributions and
specific next steps for improving the infrastructure for library
research.

Participants are expected to read the accepted submissions beforehand.
The technical presentations, although based on the accepted papers,
should not provide mere summaries of the papers. Instead, authors are
encouraged to use their presentation slots (20 + 10 mins) to bring up
topics for discussion.

The technical presentations are mixed with scientific and
organizational discussions. The discussions aim at furthering the
topics of the presentations, thus their agenda will be publicly
discussed among the participants and then posted on the website of the
symposium. All participants are expected to come prepared with their
tentative answers or thoughts.

The full-day symposium starts with a keynote talk for the stimulation
of discussion and concludes with a plenary discussion that decides the
specific next steps for improving the infrastructure for library
research.

Yes, I know.

Yes, but I was talking of the default action.  I believe, default should be to
create documentation and source only.

Haven't we reached concensus yet?

Hm, I believe I voted for:

1) modify the axiom script to transform

     axiom --document=foo bar etc

   into a call

     document --foo=bar etc

   furthermore
 
     axiom --document=foo bar
 
   into a call
 
     document --foo bar
 
   and finally
 
     axiom --document bar
 
   into 
 
     document bar

2) and install *.spad.pamphlet instead of *.spad into
   target/i686-pc-linux/src/algebra/
 
   That this didn't happen in the first place is *really* strange in my
   opinion.

3) apart of that, install the SPADEDIT script into target/i686-pc-linux/lib/

   I'll have to modify it a tiny little bit if you agree on (2).  In
   particular, it may make sense to make it obey an environment variable, say,
   AXIOMEDITOR, that contains the name of an editor to be called with two
   arguments, namely line-number and filename.

   However, I believe that any script is better than no script, because many
   people will not have write access to the target/i686-pc-linux/lib/
   directory, so they cannot use the HyperDoc functionality.


Well, I do not insist on (3). But (1) and (2) would be important to me.


Martin

Hi, yes, I am subsribed to both axiom lists, but I was just busy. I
missed a discussion about the GSoC. I think all of us has already
expressed our opinions.

Thanks for the wishes, I also wish the Axiom project to become more
widespread and to succeed.

I think CAS is popular among students (as SAGE or SymPy shows) and
also I think that a full potential of the computer algebra systems was
not fully explited at all so far. However, it needs to be usable from
a widespread, standard, preferably highlevel language. Lisp, SPAD, or
Aldor are probably not going to be mainstream soon (and in my opinion
that is the crucial factor of attracting more people to any software),
but we had this discussion already, I know that some of you disagree,
but that's what I think about it.

I am also interested in collaboration. For example I am curious, how
the Gruntz algorithm is going to look like in Aldor. However, Aldor is
still not opensource and as I read some posts, maybe it is still not
clear if it ever will (by open source, I mean DFSG free
http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines). And if you choose
the way of improving SPAD by yourself, with Axiom the only program
that uses it (correct me if I am wrong), then in my opinion it's the
same technological mistake as Maple or Mathematica did. I understand
the points of trying to make a better language, however, I myself am
not going to do it, as I don't believe it can ever really succeed. As
I talked with some of the students applying to SymPy, they have pretty
similar opinions to mine. So the time will tell, who invested his time
better. I just want to make the point, that although we all want to
contribute in the CAS field, I came to the conclusion that I can help
the field more by contributing to SymPy rather than to Axiom.

Regards,
Ondrej

Perhaps there is a little more to say about it.

One thing to keep in mind is that at the time Axiom development
began, circa 1980, Lisp *was* then what one might have been
called a "main stream" language. Arguably it is still main stream
although somewhat marginalized by the current alternatives. Lisp
is an ideal environment for developing new languages so that it
was quite natural for the developers of Axiom to develop a new
language for Axiom as part of the basic design. Even Sage has
a front-end pre-processor to make Python more "friendly" for
math users and it has forked a version of Pyrex as it's
"compiled" language. So I am saying this as a caution: Just
because Python is popular today, this does not provide any long
term guarantee longevity.

But language politics aside, I am no longer convinced that the
association of Axiom with Lisp is particularly beneficial to
the Axiom project. And personally I believe your approach is
right in turns of attracting new people to the subject. For
that reason I do not see any conflict in us pursuing different
parallel paths to the same goals. After all, the internal design
of Axiom and even the SPAD language itself is not so different
than Python. Maybe some day even parts of Axiom might be written
in Python or SymPy might incorporate a large part of the current
Axiom Library in Pythonic form. That this sort of collaboration
might be possible is one of the great strengths of open source
software development.

So lets remain in touch as and when time permits.

Mea Culpa.

As the designer and developer of the overly complex socket communication
system, I must take responsibility for this mess.  This system was
originally implemented on IBM RT workstations running AIX in 1989.  In AIX
there were no lightweight threads, so that really was not an option.  But
the real motivation for using sockets was that we envisioned running
HyperDoc  and Axiom on different machines.  In those days we had powerful
mainframes and wimpy workstations.  Of course it was never really
implemented to work that way, but the overly complex socket approach was
never removed.

There also would have been no HyperDoc if we'd done this a few years later.
At the time web browsers were non-existent.  I'd be in favor of dumping
HyperDoc and implementing a browser interface, but I'm not going to do that,
and I don't see it happening soon.

I also did the socket interface to the graphics system for the same reason:
we wanted to run things of different systems, and again it never happened.

So that's the historical perspective.

I apologize for leaving you guys with this overly complex mess.

That is true. However the key to success is just in finding enough
motivated people who are going to stick together and produce something
useful. And actually, to me it seems it's only about the politics. I
wasn't even alive when Axiom was started, thus it's difficult for me
to judge what the most popular language was at that time, however it's
seems to me that at that time, the methodology of programming was
quite different (for example the computer memory was a limiting factor
and the overhead of a language like python would be completely
devastating, none of which is a problem today for most of the
problems).

So it's almost certain that Python is going to be around for couple of
years, but in the 25 years horizon, it's actually pretty clear it will
not, at least not in the current form. However, if my program is not
going to be used anyway in 25 years, or only marginally, I prefer to
have something good today and attract people today, not tomorrow. Do
you have some estimate, how successful Axiom was in 1980s, when lisp
was quite more popular, than it is today? It's an unfair comparison,
because something like SymPy wouldn't be possible without the internet
and opensource and if I lived in 1980s, I wouldn't even started
anything like that, becase I wouldn't have means of spreading it to
people and especially getting anyone interested. Today's situation is
incredible - it's enough to write a code, put it on the web, create
some documentation and it will start living on its own if it is good
enough, because people will find it in google.

As to the collaboration - I think SAGE could use much of the Axiom, as
it already glues a lot of nice software. And once it is in python, it
can be used immediatelly by SymPy or any other project.

Yes.

I think you will find in the case of Axiom that efficiency concerns are
still very important - I refer you to the earlier discussion on notangle
in lisp as an example.  (note to self - iron out the last bugs in that...)

For simple computer algebra problems computers may have made the
question of resources less critical, but mathematical software in
particular has a tendency to always push the bounds of what is possible.
 Of course the trade-off must be made between maintainability and
efficiency, but I think Axiom as a project is most likely going to
devote a lot of attention to being (or remaining) fast.

Cheers,
CY

It feels rather odd to me to be able to point out that Lisp
is well past that original 25 year horizon and it is still
essentially the same language as it was - dialects and various
libraries not withstanding.

When I started with the Axiom project (nearly 5 years ago) I
was at first a little amused by Tim Daly's insistence that one
should look at Axiom as something with (at least) a 30 year
horizon. That didn't seem credible to me at all.

But then what we are really talking about here is mathematics
and many of the algorithms that we are implementing in our
computer algebra systems are actually based on mathematics that
was developed as much as a *hundred* years earlier. Perhaps
Lisp is a little like that - more mathematics than a trendy
programming language.

So I wonder about Axiom. Are the design principles on which it
is based firm enough to be relevant over the long haul? Perhaps.
I have serious doubts that the principles on which Maple and
Mathematica are based will stand this long. In fact during the
time I have known them, they both seem to be converging toward
Axiom.

And here Axiom is now, nearly 30 years after it's inception. But
then Maxima (formerly Macsyma) is a system of the same time period
as Axiom and it is still alive today. We need something else to
explain that.

It is difficult to talk about "popularity" because the situation
(as you say) was very different. But actually there are probably
more lisp programmers today then there was then just like there
are more horses in North America now then there was prior to the
era of mechanization of agriculture motor vehicles. Axiom was
certainly one of the premier computer algebra systems of it's
time - because it was (almost) the only computer algebra system.
And if you will permit me to distinguish between computer algebra
and symbolic computation, then it is still (almost) the only
computer algebra system. It was and still ahead of it's time.

But I think it is a fair comparison because the same things are
true about Axiom. Axiom would not be here today if it was not
for open source and the Internet. In fact nearly 30 years of
research effort was saved largely because it became possible
to make it public rather than simply die like a lot of other
commercial software packages.

I agree it is incredible but I have serious doubts about the
rest of your claim. I don't know what "good enough" means. I am
afraid that your model of development means just a lot of people
re-inventing the same thing in essentially the same way according
to the current fashion. I think that is a form of entertainment
but not real progress.

The way Axiom started was probably very similar expect for the
much smaller scale. It exists because a small number of people
where able to interest a larger number of people and a company
with enough resources like IBM. We are incredibly rich in
resources these days, but the critical part is still finding
the right people with really new ideas.

On the other hand, Axiom as a project with a 30 year time
horizon is very different. The system design on which we are
working today is essentially the same as the one originally
envisaged nearly 30 years ago. Besides saving 30 year of
intellectual effort from the trash bin, we are mostly trying to
carry on the same programme: to encode more mathematics in the
form that can be manipulated by a computer and at the same time
trying to "sell" the basic idea to people who have not yet
realized that the problem it is trying to solve even exists!

I like Python and I am glad that people are interested in it,
but I prefer to focus on the larger picture in order to see
how it fits into the long term. And I think that Python, SymPy,
Sage and Google's summer of code all have a role to play even
if that ends up by just getting more people interest in the
main subject - computer algebra.

Bill Page.

Indeed - IIRC it is up there with Fortran in terms of age.

Exactly - that is what appeals to me about making Axiom's math level
programming as much like "actual math" (whatever that means, we're still
exploring that I think) as possible.  If we really do the job well, the
result should be timeless.  I view TeX as a good example of this - it
solves its targeted problem so well that it has lasted for decades and
is still going strong.  Even if a new system should replace it the
design decisions and algorithms are likely to live on.  Axiom has the
potential to do the same thing for mathematics, and that is what makes
it such an exciting project for me.  I hate doing things more than once
- it's a waste of effort and it shouldn't be necessary except for
teaching/learning.  Axiom has the potential to let people solve problems
once, correctly, and then build off of them in a way that is convenient,
rigorous and scalable.

If not, we will upgrade to better ones as we discover them.  Even if we
aren't optimal now, I think Axiom is close enough that we can profitably
build on it as a starting point.

That is not particularly difficult.  1)  The original researchers are
still available to work on it, which helps fuel the community 2)  it was
open source before Axiom, and so built a community while it was the
"only game in town" 3) it is more of an "engineering" system at the
moment in that it focuses less on mathematical typing et. al. and more
on "getting the answer that is useful."  (Axiom may someday do that as a
special case of being correct, but it's not there yet.)  4)  It
integrates better with other tools (gnuplot and wxmaxima) that people
find convenient to use for practical work they need to get done now.

Maxima is what you look to if you want a free Maple/Mathematica.  Axiom
is a new breed and currently requires more of an initial learning
investment.  Eventually Axiom may adsorb or surpass Maxima's abilities
and be attractive to a broader audience but IMHO that will come later
(and should come later, as we have Maxima to handle those needs until we
are ready to offer something demonstrably better for the applications
needing "engineering" CAS.)

That is true to an extent (just look at the number of graphical toolkits
and window managers for X...)  but I think it is less true for more
complex software.  Blender, for example, does not have serious
competition in the open source world that I am aware of.  Nor does
BRL-CAD.  (Of course, those both started as closed source packages but
that's another post...)  Even if someone wants to re-code it in a
different language the research into the algorithms in projects like
this is re-used out of necessity.

I do not expect that people will begin working on heavy duty CASs in the
sense of trying to duplicate Axiom from scratch.  The problem is too
difficult - it is one of the few cases where learning the existing tool
is unambiguously easier than re-creating it (a problem with more basic
tools/libraries, especially in Lisp it seems...)

Which is encouraging, because it means we may have a well defined
project idea here :-).  I'd say that longevity is a sign of strength.

That is a very interesting point and I wonder if it will be one of the
major formative changes in the field over the next 100 years of
mathematical research - the pursuit of assurance of correctness without
direct human mechanical verification.  The human mind has limitations
and there may be interesting and useful correctness proofs that are
intrinsically beyond the ability of any one human mind to verify.  But
if we can verify a verifier and trust that verifier, we can know the
proof is real.  (After all, if we accept a review of a proof as correct
we are trusting the minds of the reviewers to be accurate.)  CASs offer
convenient ways to solve problems today, but they are not yet better
than human minds at being correct/verified.  I hope someday Axiom will
be - just as we can only see into the depths of the universe with tools
beyond our own senses, we may find ourselves gazing into the depths of
mathematics with mechanical tools more capable of recognizing
correctness of large scale proofs than our own minds.

Cheers,
CY

I see. I am not interested in mathematics (for this there is Axiom),
but just a basic symbolic manipulation and for this the algorithms are
not difficult and are well-known. And it's really not difficult to
code them. The time consuming part is the interface and that is imho
quite different from Axiom's.

It looks that you just re-did work on last file that I converted
(I left non-bootstrap files as-is).

Hi,

  As I said, if there is something valuable to the entire comunity,
we should try to get it proposed to the "upper" stream (i.e. where
we branched from).

What I committed before leaving was part of a larger patch.  If it is
worked already done, I'm sad to see it wasn't proposed for build-improvements.
Because I would have concentrated on some other paters.

There are more changes to come, but not before I find a more
reliable network connection and ways to install autoconf-2.60 on
mingw/msys.

What problems are you having with autoconf on MSYS/MinGW?

I built autoconf-2.61 and m4-1.4.9 directly from the gnu distribution
sources. Provided you have upgraded m4 first, autoconf passes all
tests.

Apparently you can also install autoconf-2.61 and m4-1.4.7 binaries
from:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148008

I ran build-setup.sh with autoconf-2.61 to create a new ./configure
and built build-improvements on my Solaris 10.2 x86 system and on
Windows without any problems.

Is there any particular reason you want to continue using the older
version autoconf-2.60? (I think you can, but I haven't actually built
2.60 on MSYS/MinGW.)

Regards,
Bill Page.

Build of Autoconf-2.6[01] fails for me with:

  "The system cannot find the specified file"

I've spent some time understanding this; I made some progress, but not
to the point of getting pass that failure.  my frustration with windows
is only growing.

I think it best to avoid the trap that most linux developers
fall into when working with Windows. As far as I am concerned
it is just another operating system ...

I have:

$ m4 --version
m4 (GNU M4) 1.4.9

$ perl --version

This is perl, v5.6.1 built for msys

$ gcc --version
gcc.exe (GCC) 3.4.2 (mingw-special)
$ make --version
GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.
Built for i686-pc-msys

----------

My first guess is that your problem might have something to do
with be the version of Perl that you are using. I have never
used ActivePerl for buidling MSYS/MinGW apps.

I prefer to install as much from the MSYS/MinGW distribution
as possible. See for example the instructions here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom

under the heading "Building Axiom on Windows".

Then I built m4 and autoconf from the GNU sources without any
problems.

I recommend that we go to autoconf-2.61 for all Axiom builds.

Apart from ActivePerl, I have the same setting.

Maybe.  But, again, the idea of using ActivePerl for msys/mingw came from
mingw website.  I did not pull it out of my hat.

The "trap" to which I was referring has been called "Linux
chauvinism", see for example:

http://www.softpanorama.org/OSS/Bla_faq/raymondism.shtml

by Nikolai Bezroukov

In my own words its something like this: Assuming that because
one is having trouble in an environment with which one is less
familiar, that it is therefore inferior and a unnecessary source
of frustration - sort of opposite to the slogan: "familiarity
breeds contempt". It is a trap because believing this tends to
make it seem true.

But I did *not* intend to accuse you of this even by implication.
Sorry. It's just that I see this statement made very often in
different ways and I think it tends to perpetuate views that I
think are undesirable. However frustration, is of course quite
natural.

I suppose you meant ActivePerl-5.8.8.820?

http://www.activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/more_information.plex

Perl comes in two flavours from ActiveState the 5.6.x track and the
5.8.x track. Both are considered current releases. I have 5.8.8 in
my Windows installation but 5.6.1 in MSYS.

Well, it was only my first guess. But just be sure I renamed my
MSYS /bin/perl to /bin/old_perl and restarted MSYS so that it
picks up ActivePerl-5.8.8.820 from my Windows installation. Now
I can reproduce the error that you reported:

$ perl --version

This is perl, v5.8.8 built for MSWin32-x86-multi-thread

$ cd autoconf-2.61

$ make clean

$ ./configure

Gee, that sounds familiar. Where did I hear that before? Oh,
sorry. I forgot. This is the Axiom open source project - the
one where each developer chooses there own flavor and version
of the basic tools ... I with draw my recommendation. Let's
just all continue to do it our own way. ;)

I have a functional development environment under windows -- cygwin --
but I cannot use it because GCL does not work under cygwin and I
have been told on this list that windows people don't care about
GCL under cygwin.  I guess the fact that windows people on this list don't
help that much to make concrete forward progress is OK.  Now, I've
been trying to set up a reasonable environment for working on Axiom
with no good result so far and I'm told by non-implicative non-accusation
that I would be suffering from trap known as "linux chauvinism" when nobody
knows what I think of comparison of linux and windows.  I guess that is
fair.  And my problems did not go away.  I guess that is forward progress.

I believe you got it wrong; even with a smiley.
There are several "rules" I've developed over the years, while
maintaining linux boxes, that include:
  (1) don't mess with "system" tools packaged by linux distros;
  (2) duplicating tools under /usr/local, sooner or later causes
      troubles.
  (3) install system tools under /usr/local only when they solve
      fundamental problems.

I suspect you'd have much more effective impact at explaining me
how automake-2.61 fare vis-a-vis the above three rules.

What do you mean that GCL does not work under cygwin? It works
for me. You just can't compile it under cygwin.

I think that in general windows people don't care much for
cygwin. period. What it does is foreign to them plus it is a
poor replacement for linux, if linux is what you really want.

I think that is typical. Most "windows people" aren't that
interested in application development. According to the Windows
user model that is somebody else's problem. Of course there are
Windows developers, even Windows open source developers but the
ratio of users to developers is much higher for Windows than
linux (perhas by as much as several orders of magnitude).

Ok, that was gratuatous on my part, for which I do apologize.
It just turned out that I happened to be reading Nikolai's stuff
when you wrote: "my frustration with windows is only growing"
and it touched a nerve.

not. sorry.

I could repeat almost word-for-word a similar statement by Tim
Daly concerning svn. It turns out that I can reproduce both of
your problems and I discussed how to solve both of them and
still neither of you are interested. I guess that's progress.

not.

So install MSYS from pre-packaged components and the problem goes
away. Just because other people get away with using ActivePerl
with minGW doesn't make it a "supported configuration" or good
idea.

MSYS is not a linux distro by any imagination but I think the same
principle applies. Install MSYS from "standard" components as I
indicated here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom

Then build autoconf-2.6x. Install it where ever you like.

The current MSYS developer package does not contain autoconf-2.6x.
If you think you need at least 2.60 what other choice do you have?
If not revert the autoconf stuff to 2.59. (Waldek is still using
2.59 in wh-sandbox.)

That means the same thing for me: If I cannot compile it under cygwin,
it does not work for me as far as Axiom development is concerned.

But, I do not mean linux.  My impression is that you're
completely missing the picture by micro-focusing on linux vs.
non-linux environment and drawing misplaced conclusions
characterizations.

What I want is to have a reasonable development under windows
-- whether it is mingw or cygwin, I don't care much.  The only
thing I care about is that the environment does not disrupt
me much from doing actual work.

OK; I believe the logical conclusion for me is probably that I
drop any work on Axiom on windows.

Granted you can reproduce the problems, but the solution you suggested
did not work for me. I moved ActivePerl's path away from /bin and
/mingw/bin.  Now, I tried to install autoconf-2.60 -- I explained
why I cannot require autoconf-2.61; more on this below.  Except the
build goes into infinite loop, so that I never get a functional build.

But I already have MSYS pre-packaged components from mingw.org!

Definitely, my reading of the mingw documentation from mingw
website is that ActivePerl is a "supported configuration".
But again, that point is moot by now.  Even old Perl from
msys does not get me install Autoconf-2.60.

Which implies that I should not even try your suggestion of installing
Autoconf-2.61 from a non-officially supported third party.  I don't
think your statements are coherent.

I'm very familiar with that webpage; it does not solve
the issues I'm facing.

Bill -- again, building Autoconf-2.60 does not work on the "virgin"
msys/mingw fails as an infinite loop.

I move from Autoconf-2.5x to Autoconf-2.60 because:
  (1) it does fix a bug, that turns out to be serious in later
      development for Axiom (partly because of some bugs in Axiom).
  (2) all my development machines have Autoconf-2.60 installed
      (prepackages with the linux distribution).

As I see this, I can the reasonable choice for me is to stop any
work related to Axiom on windows; that save me valuable time, and
probably spares me from unwarranted unhelpful characterizations
and moralization.  If people care about Axiom on windows, they
will find resources to get it happen.  I'm done.

> not.

As I recall the whole Axiom project spent a considerable amount
of effort trying to resolve the SVN problem. You did a great job
trying to set up SVN on axiom-developer (successfully?) and Google
(unsuccessfully). 

I eventually experimented with other systems. You advocated darcs
and mercurial as I remember. I looked at darcs but my investigations,
and I believe your comments, left me with the impression that it is
not ready for a full, large projects. I did not try mercurial.

SVN times out on me and I have to do a checkout+12update cycle to
get a full axiom copy. Checkin takes over half an hour. SVN uses
twice the space of the Axiom distribution. It all feels slow,
ponderous, and heavy. And SVN wedges, demanding I "cleanup", which
never succeeds.

I eventually tried git. Checkout and checkin over the network take
about the same time as a local disk-to-disk copy. It uses only a tiny
amount of additional disk space. I like it so much that I've moved all
of my research work into git and use it for normal work purposes.

So, yes, you did reproduce my SVN problems and you discussed how to
solve my problems. However, SVN itself has problems (slow, unreliable,
and large) which have no solution. The question wasn't "can it be
made to work" but rather "why waste the time and space".

Git is the best technical solution, thus I use git. 
To me, that's progress.

Tim

Why not? It is not necessary to build gcl as part of the Axiom
build - just install the windows binary for gcl, like other users
Windows do.

??? That doesn't sound right. Did you take a look at

MSYS looks in a lot of places besides /bin and /mingw/bin.
If ActivePerl is in your windows PATH, it will be accessible
to MSYS.

But if you have /bin/perl installed it will be found by MSYS
first before ActivePerl.

then that seems very strange. It works for me. And if I rename
/bin/perl  to something else (and thereby use ActivePerl from
windows), it fails that way you said it does for you.

By your rules you would only do this if you had no other choice.
What choice do you have? If you want to abandon Windows development
for build-improvements, fine, it's your choice. But would still
try to encourage you to continue.

Your choice. Maybe you can wait until someone produces an MSYS
developer package with 2.60 pre-installed. Again I apologize for
my "unwarranted unhelpful characterizations and moralization".
I have no excuse except to observe that it is common human failing.

I doubt that very much. All that is likely to happen is that they
will dismiss Axiom as uninteresting. Consider for example Martin's
recent experience with promotion of his guess package for Axiom.
My current goal is to produce a version of Axiom for windows that
has this (and other bug fixes by Waldek) pre-installed. Right now
build-improvements is the best tool to accomplish this. Porting
upstream build-improvement changes to wh-sandbox seems very
difficult, so I am currently looking at pulling what's needed from
wh-sandbox back into build-improvements. The changes in the
wh-sandbox algebra build makes this just a little tricky in the
case of the guess package. I would also like to pull the changes
for the algebra build since it avoids embedding Lisp into the
algebra files, but I think I'll tackle that second (or wait for
someone else to do it).

> I'm done.

I'm sorry to hear that. :-(

Bill Page.

I never completed the full setup of the SVN server component on
axiom-developer because that required an upgrade to Apache and
our current Apache configuration file does not work automatically
under the new version of Apache. Some small changes are required
and more testing, but I did not complete this yet. It no longer
seemed important once the problems with SourceForge were solved.

The problem with Google is different because we kept tripping
up on the repository size constraint even after they increased
the limit by about a factor of 4. This could be solved if we
decided to abandon a lot of the history which involves a lot
of unnecessary duplication etc. Again this could be done if any
really had any interest in it.

In fact both are used on projects about the size of Axiom and we
have both darcs and mercurial mirrors of the build-improvements
branch on axiom-developer.org.

That was exactly my own experience with SVN up until December
of last year. At that time SourceForge provided a new url for
SVN access that solved the problem. See:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-12/msg00156.html

I have no problems using SVN on Linux and on Windows for either
of the locations where I work on Axiom since that time.

I do not think it is slow or unreliable since we got the new url
from SourceForge, but of course we cannot do anything about it's
size. The main reason to put up with the waste of time and space
is for the sake of cooperation with other developers who just as
unwilling to change. Somebody has to compromise or the result is
the current situation.

To me, progress occurs when we manage to cooperate and work
smoothly together to achieve a common goal.

Running the web server code written in Lisp or Boot inside
Axiom is certainly a possibility. For ideal results we would
need someone (like Kai) who is sufficiently fluent in Lisp.
The interface with the rest of Axiom is quite simple using
some other details provided in an email form Tim Daly about
the same time.

I would rather like to work this one out in detail but I
would require some fairly direct help with the Lisp coding.

Aw, the hard part ... ;-)

Another alternative would be to write a script in Python or
Perl which prepares the input from the browser, starts
Axiom, runs the input, collects the output and sends it to
the browser. This could either be a stand alone script that
includes built-in web server support or it could be written
as a cgi script to be called from a webserver such as apache.

The latter method is essentially the method used by the
MathAction interface on the Axiom wiki. I recall that there
is a small problem with the way Python starts AXIOMsys that
prevents this from running easily under Windows (since "pipe"
support on Windows is very different than Linux), but I think
this could be solved - which would also be interesting since
it would then permit us to run MathAction on Windows as one
option for user interface to Axiom with browser support
similar to hyperdoc. (This is possible now under linux).

OK, if that's easier, could you tell me how to make something that looks like a
link in the browser, like "doit", starts a script which echoes some html code,
and renders this code again. 

This stuff should run without administrator or root privileges.

It's just to show that it works.  More elegant solutions can be implemented by
those who know later.

Thanks,

Martin

  (1) but I'm not like other windows users;  I'm doing something
      to Axiom that most of them -- if I understand your previous
      postings correctly.  I'm doing changes to Axiom, and I need
      to make sure that what was previously working (build Axiom
      with or without bundled GCL) is still working.

  (2) you would have to assume that although I'm facing build issues, I'm
      not totally dumb and there are reasons why I need to do what I'm
      doing, i.e. building GCL.
      Otherwise, I feel like after wasting time fighting the build
      issues under windows itself, I'm wasting time at being convinced
      that I really do not have time to waste on windows issues.

      What I'm looking for is way to get forward, given the constraints
      I enounciated.  I need automake-2.60 working, I need the ability
      to compile GCL, among other things.  If you know of no way that would
      let me do those, that is fine.  But, please don't waste time arguing
      why I need to compile GCL.

      I need to compile GCL as long as that is the only supported Lisp
      system.

yes, I believed you.  The trouble is that it is not working for

but at moment it does not help me make forward progress.

Indeed.  If I had infinite amount of time, I may continue this
"windows entertainment", but I haven't.  And I don't have time for
infinite argumentation either.

I know that; I may be clueless at how to solve the issue I'm
facing currently, but I'm exactly newbie in program and system
development.  I need a help that is more than "basic".

But, never used if its path is after /bin, where MSYS's perl resides.

I know that.  I need more than "101" stuff.

I believed you when you said it worked for you.  I did believe there
was a way to get everything working -- that is why I originally said
that I was looking for a way to get a reasonable build environment
set up.  If you can't trust me, you can't help me :-)

(1) stop sinking my time in this windows+axiom black hole
(2) get a way to get a reasonable build environment.

so far, I've seen more "discouragement"; sorry to put it that way.
But, I'm sure there people on this list that can sort this out, so
my not working anymore on windows+axiom is not a big deal.

The "wget" that comes with msys/ming packaged does not work for me.
So I use ncftp to download tarballs.  I don't believe that changes
anything though.

as I said, I already have that.

this works fine.

this step, attempts to install things for me (which I was
surprised of), and goes into infinite loop.  There is no way
to effectively stop the build, except killing the msys shell
itself.

then, I'm afraid Axiom is effectively uninteresting to them.  If the
Axiom community coming from windows users cannot find developers from
that community that understands them better than I do, it is unlikely
that Axiom will ever be of use to them.  Interested people usually
put their money whether their month is.

I'm sorry for Martin.

What I've learnt over the years working on several projects (usually
open source) and the C++ language is that if something is of interest
to you better make sure that you invest enough effort to meet the
interest.  It is unlikely that just waiting for something to happen
will effectively make that thing happen.  That certainly partly
explains, apart from natural research curiosity, why I spend resources
working on Axiom.

I was hoping to make it better, but I faced issues and I did not find
the kind of resources that would help me make progress.  I do hope
someone in this community has better chance that I.

It would be very useful to me if you could include some actual
output cut-and-paste from your attempt.

Obviously this behaviour of make is very bizarre. I do not see
any attempt to install things when I run make (as the output
in my last email showed). Of course it does later if I run
'make install'.  Therefore something rather fundamental must
be different between your configuration and mine.

Does your Makefile start like this?

# Makefile.in generated by automake 1.9.6 from Makefile.am.
# Makefile.  Generated from Makefile.in by configure.
...

Does your output from make at least start like this (before
it goes into a loop)?

Making all in bin
make[1]: Entering directory `/home/Administrator/autoconf-2.60/bin'
rm -f autom4te autom4te.tmp
sed -e 's|@SHELL[@]|/bin/sh|g' -e 's|@PERL[@]|/bin/perl|g' -e
's|@bindir[@]|/usr/local/bin|g' -e

...

I.e. a normal recursive make?

So far I can only think of 3 possible causes:

1) Makefile is corrupt

   - What version of tar do you use?

     mine: 

     $ tar --version
     tar (GNU tar) 1.13.19

   - Windows line endings (cr)

     only Unix line endings are expected

2) Different version of make?

   mine:

   $ make --version
   GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.

3) Different shell?

   mine:

   $ sh --version    
   GNU bash, version 2.04.0(1)-release (i686-pc-msys)
   Copyright 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Perhaps 2 and 3 are already ruled out since apparently both you
and I can build gcl and Axiom from build-improvements without
any problem.

Stunned.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Hello,

The file interop.boot is incorrectly translated by bootsys because of
the use of 'NE'. 'NE' is translated to '(not (equal' by depsys but
bootsys translate it to '(/='.

You can trigger this bug if you issue in the interpreter:

x^(1/7)

Don't know if there are similar bugs in other parts of the interpreter.


There is another thing with build-improvements, with this sequence of
commands:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mkdir /home/greg/axiom-build-improvements
lndir /home/greg/TDevel/axiom.build-improvements /home/greg/axiom-build-improvements/
cd /home/greg/axiom-build-improvements/
./configure --enable-checking --prefix=/home/greg/axiom.bi.debug
make && make install
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the file /home/greg/axiom.bi.debug/bin is the axiom script (and not a
directory).

Greg

The function testInterpolant in guessing package has the following
header:

testInterpolant(resi: List SUP S,
                list: List F,
                testList: List UFPSSUPF,
                exprList: List EXPRR,
                initials: List EXPRR,
                guessDegree: NNI,
                D: HPSPEC,
                dummy: Symbol, op: BasicOperator, options: LGOPT,
                list: List F)
               : Union("failed", Record(function: EXPRR, order: NNI))

In particular the parameter 'list' is repeated twice.  AFAICS Spad
does not allow overloading of parameter names and even if such
overloading is allowed the header still have problem because
types are identical.

BTW: I found the problem because generated Lisp also have duplicate
argument and SBCL chokes on it (GCL did not complain).

sorry, I thought this was already on the list (with the obvious patch).  I'll
send you an updated version of the package (I think Greg pointed out also some
other typos) within two hours or so.

Does this mean that you have axiom with sbcl running?

I am in the process of merging sbcl support into wh-sandbox.
ATM algebra compiled, but I am getting errors during database
build.  I did not try any serous tests yet, so I expect a lot
more problems.  And to have fully functional Axiom we need mere
code (especially sockets).

Is there a binary version of gcl suitable for Axiom developement?
The latest binary I see is 2.6.6, but AFAIK with 2.6.6 we are
getting errors which vanish if we use 2.6.7 or 2.6.8.

Also, can one install gcl without affecting existing Mingw
installation (the gcl readme claims that on Windows gcl
need a specific, rather old Mingw version -- for me
downgrading Mingw is not an option)?

You are right and what I wrote above is wrong. Gaby also has
pointed out that it is not currently realistic to depend on the
GCL binaries on Windows for Axiom development.

As far as I can tell no one has posted any binaries for GCL on
windows newer than

  gcl_2.6.6.mingw32_cltl1_japi_20050210.exe 22-Mar-2005

at

  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcl/binaries/stable

And gcl-2.6.8pre is still a "pre-release". I guess the gcl
project is also critally lacking in resources. If it would be
helpful I could certainly upload a windows binary of this
pre-release to the Axiom Wiki web site. But I am discouraged
also by Gaby's observation that there does not seem to be much
interest in development of the Windows versions of GCL or
Axiom. :-(

MinGW is required in order to compile Lisp to object code and
of course to compile the Lisp output of the SPAD compiler in
Axiom. Unlike Linux, it is not correct to assume that a C
compiler is available in the basic window installation. The
existing binary installer that I prepared for Axiom on Windows
includes the necessary parts of MinGW to permit GCL and Axiom
to compile object code. I think a similar binary installer
for GCL should include these same parts of MinGW so that the
GCL installation will be complete and fully functional.

Bill Page.

I have been thinking about socket support in Axiom and
extending that to SPAD as described here:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSocketsInSPAD

If we could support sockets at the level of SPAD, it would
be very easy to write web server based interfaces such as
discussed recently by Martin.

I would be very interested in any help and advice you can
give me on how to make this work.

Bill Page.

I have been attempting to generalize Waldek's finite state machine
using macros, and have essentially run up against the limits of my tiny
Lisp skills.  Can anybody tell me how to get this thing to expand into
something like Waldek's code?  (I can provide the whole file if it is
needed.)

Thanks,
Cliff

I must admit that I do not understand what you are tring to do now
-- what you posted looks like macro definition, but it contains
(hardcodes) most of had written version.

Have you looked at <http://ll1.ai.mit.edu/shriram-talk.pdf> (it
contains Scheme example of macro-generating finite state
machine)?

Low level macro version of finite state machine may look like:

(automaton
  (setup_code)
  (state normal-start
     (normal_start_setup)
     (-> start-tag-code-1 chunk-start-tag-1)
     (-> newline-code normal-start)
     (default normal))
  (state normal
     (-> newline-code normal-start)
     (default normal))
  (state chunk-start-tag-1
     (-> start-tag-code-2 in-chunk-start-tag
         ;;; Action
         (setf start-pos (+ pos 1)))
  ....

To generate our  code from the above one has to define macros
automaton, state, defalut and ->.  state, defalut and -> may
be local to automaton.  In the above I assumend that we use
chacter codes, but we could also use characters and write:

   (-> #\< chunk-start-tag-1)

A higher level version may do transitions on strings, so you
could write:

   (-> "<<"  in-chunk-start-tag
         ;;; Action
         (setf start-pos (+ pos 1)))

and the macros would automatically generate intermediate states.

Extending your code to automatically handle any set of delimiters (not
just the <<chunkname>>= we currently use) was the goal.  I would like
to write notangle in lisp once and be done with it ;-).

No.  Thanks for the link, I'll check it out.  Kai sent me some finite
state machine code as well, and I am working on trying to understand
it.  I was trying to deviate from your code as little as possible
because your code has proven itself fast and I didn't want to
accidentally introduce any performance hits.

That's what I'm trying to achieve.  I guess I need to think more about
how to set up the macros.

Cheers,

Issue 330 just happened to me -- working in Axiom I left gazonk0.fn
file.  Later working as another user I got failures because this
file was present. 

AFAICS to root cause is GCL bug, namely the following sequence:

(defun foo(x) x) (compiler::emit-fn t) (compile 'foo)

leaves trash gazonk0.fn file (the other gazonk files are
correctly erased, but .fn file is left in place).

You may say that the gazonk-name function should prevent the
problem.  But Axiom gazonk-name (and gcl too) checks only if
the gazonk0.lsp (or generally gazonkn.lsp) file is present, it
ignores other gazonk files.  Axiom gazonk-name generates repeatable
names making conflicts extremally likely (gcl-2.6.8 embeds
process id in the name reducing chance for conflict).

We could easily provide better gazonk-name, but it seems that
gazonk files really are a can worms from security point of view.
Trying to find simple and safe way to create temporary files
the best thing (exluding special OS support) probably is
to create (in exclusive mode) temporary directory (using random
names to reduce denial of service attacks) and create gazonk files
inside.  Unfortunatly,  apropriate functions are system specific.

I suspect that even people advocating literate progammining do not
consider _unprocessed_ pamphlets as human readable (to say the truth
current Axiom sources contain many examples of using noweb for
obfuscation).  For pamphlets to enhance readability we will need
specialized editor/viewer (and considering our resouces I am not
sure if 25 years is enough to develop a good one).

Hmm, 2 is easy to do.  But I wonder why you consider it important
(I personally do not care very much one way or another because I
typically have the whole build tree at hand).

Concering 3: you solve nicely part of the problem (that is finding
correct place in source files).  When I first saw you script I had
doubts because user may have quite different preferences for
editor/viewer and passing line numbers to editors can be quite
compicated (I am affraid that there are still editors with no
support for passing line numbers).  But now I think that the only
way to "solve" problem of correct way to invoke editor is
to make it user responsibility.  More precisely, I think that
user should have possibility to effectively replace SPADEDIT
by own program.  Of course, most user will benefit from finding
the correct place, so IMHO correct way is to provide in SPADEDIT
escape to user code.  Your AXIOMEDITOR variable (or maybe call it
SPADEDIT_ACTION) could do this if you pass to it just file name
and line number (as two separate arguments).  In such case we
probably should provide a few example editors -- that is
shell functions which call say emacs, vi, maybe kdvi.

Well, meanwhile I *do* prefer the pamphlet files, since several of them contain
a lot more information than the spad files.  Furthermore, I guess it might
encourage people to add documentation notes, even if they would only be for
themselves.

Since item 1) was the request to install "document", in whatever form, it is
easy to generate dvi or spad files.

So really, I beg that you adapt the change.

There are two reasons:

* because of the hierarchy in our department, I maintain the "up to date"
  version of axiom, which currently is wh-sandbox.  I cannot place the build
  tree on the network file system, because of quota restrictions.  Thus,
  everytime I recompile, I would have to move the pamphlet files myself, move
  document and SPADEDIT into place.  It's simply a nuisance.  Another nuisance
  is having to manually make the aldor compatibility files.  It takes me about
  an hour every time I have to do it, since I tend to forget little things
  (eg., make 3.81beta does not work), and some bits change (eg., out of source
  build is preferred now).

* In my opinion, documenting the algebra is one of the most important goals of
  the project.  It is superb that I can ask you some things about Risch etc.,
  but most people I know do not want to ask "silly questions", and, maybe even
  more importantly, what are we going to do when you become broker on wall
  street?

  I consider installing the spad files as a very effective way to loose
  information and motivation to collect information.

Yes. Furthermore, I'd default it to some editor or pager which is usually
installed. (mabe "less"?) Note that SPADEDIT is also called via )edit, so it is
also a MS Windows question.  I should also rename $number to $line.

emacs +$line $spadname
emacsclient +$line $spadname
xemacs +$line $spadname
gnuclient +$line $spadname
vi +$line $spadname
less +$line $spadname


kwrite --line $line $spadname
kate --line $line $spadname


any windows guis out there ;-) ?


Below you find the appropriate SPADEDIT, in case you are (which I hope)
implementing my request 1).



For kdvi, the case is a little more complicated, but not too much: most
importantly, we would need to find the right file number in the spad.tex file,
and the latter would have to be latex'ed with --src-specials enabled.  Then one
can say

kdvi file:mantepse.spad.dvi#src:34mantepse.spad.tex

But really, I'd leave this as a future project.

\title{SPADEDIT}
\author{Martin Rubey}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
  \verb|SPADEDIT| is a shell script that handles features to display or edit
  source files.
\end{abstract}

The script described here is called (at least) in two different situations:
\begin{itemize}
\item it is called by HyperDoc, when the user clicks on a link like
  \verb|INT.spad|. In this case it receives two arguments, namely 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item the file in which HyperDoc believes the constructur is defined, which
    is currently of the form \verb|$AXIOM/../../src/algebra/INT.spad|, i.e.,
    the path to the source directory, then the abreviation of the constructor,
    and finally \verb|.spad| appended,

  \item the long name of the constructor.
  \end{enumerate} 

\item it is called from the interpreter, when the usser issues \verb|)edit|. In
  this case it receives exactly one argument, even if it \verb|)edit| had  no
  or several arguments supplied. 

  \begin{itemize}
  \item if several arguments were supplied, only the first is passed to
    \verb|SPADEDIT| and all the others are ignored.
  \item if no arguments were supplied, \verb|SPADEDIT| receives the last
    argument it received, or \verb|NIL| if so far \verb|)edit| was always
    called with no arguments. Furthermore, if the argument of \verb|)edit|
    starts with a dot, it is also not passed to \verb|SPADEDIT|.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

<<*>>=
#! /bin/bash

if [ $# -eq 1 ]; then
@

Thus, we were called by \verb|)edit| and can simply call the text editor of our
choice:

<<*>>=
 gnuclient $1 &

else
@

We are now in the case where we were called by HyperDoc. Since filenames
supplied by HyperDoc do not correspond to the filenames in the current Axiom
distribution as of [[patch-50]], we have to find the right file ourselves. We
simply ask grep the directory containing the source files to return file and
line number within that file. Note that, if only spad files are installed, we
should replace \verb|.spad.pamphlet| by \verb|.spad|.

<<*>>=
  f=$(basename $1 .spad)
  h=$(grep -n ")abb.* $f " $AXIOM/src/algebra/*.spad.pamphlet)
@

Note that we rather extract the abbreviation of the domain, instead of using
the full name. The reason is best explained by example. Consider the following
two lines in \verb|integer.spad|:

\begin{verbatim}
)abbrev package INTSLPE IntegerSolveLinearPolynomialEquation
\end{verbatim}

and

\begin{verbatim}
)abbrev domain INT Integer
\end{verbatim}

Note that the abreviated domain name is nicely delimited by two spaces, while
we do not know what follows the long domain name. There might be spaces and a
carriage return, maybe even comments are allowed\dots.

We assume that grep produces only one result. There is no way in Axiom to deal
with several domains having the same name anyway.

The next step is to obtain the name of the source file:
<<*>>=
  spadname=${h%%:*}
@

Since pamphlets are currently not installed, and {\LaTeX} is not called with
\verb|source-specials| enabled, displaying \verb|dvi| doesn't really work yet.

<<NOTYET *>>=
  name=$(basename $spadname)
  dviname=$AXIOM/doc/src/algebra/$name.dvi
@

Finally, we obtain the line number.

<<*>>=
  lineaux=${h#*:}
  line=${lineaux%:*}
@

Now we have everything to call our favorite editor:

<<*>>=
  gnuclient +$line $spadname
@

If \verb|dvi|'s were compiled with \verb|-source-specials|, we could also call
a \verb|dvi| viewer, for example

\begin{verbatim}
  kdvi file:$dviname#src:$line$name.tex
\end{verbatim}

but that doesn't work yet.  Furthermore, we would have to find the line number
in the \verb|.spad.tex| file.

<<*>>=  
fi
@

Yes it's probably a future project, but not too much in the future I guess.

And remember, you *don't* want to call

   latex --src-special file.spad.tex

because then all you get is \specials that lead you from kdvi to the 
.tex file and not to the .pamphlet file. The trick is to use srcltx.sty 
and a good naming scheme for the .pamphlet - .tex relation. I could 
convince the current maintainer of srcltx.sty to include an appropriate 
hook for filename translation into srcltx.sty version 1.6.

All the best

Thanks to this recommendation for Cliff, I recently installed
nexenta OpenSolaris from the free OpenSolaris <starter kit> DVD.

http://get.opensolaris.org

I installed OpenSolaris under Microsoft Virtual PC 2007 on my
Windows XP box. It works great! Nexenta OpenSolaris is the first
Solaris distribution that I have been able to install on Virtual
PC, although I routinely run a 2nd copy of Windows and SuSE 10.2
virtual machines.

I had a small problem with the screen resolution (at first limited
to 640x480) but this was easily cured by a creating and modifying
the default xorg.conf to include horizontal and vertical sync,
default depth and monitor modes. Details on request.

I particularlly like the integration of the Debian work-a-like
'apt-get'. This makes it easy do things like this:

  # apt-get install subversion gcc m4 autoconf
  # apt-get install libxt-dev libx11-dev tetex-extra

(just like on Debian) to satisfy build requirements for Axiom.

Performance under Microsoft Virtual PC on my AMD 4200+ dual
core machine is quite fast.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Thanks so much for this update.  GCL development, like most open
source projects run by volunteers, usually proceeds in bursts, most
frequently during the summer months.  But I think it is also true, as
we've discussed personally in the past, that the community dynamics of
Windows computer users are by in large quite different from BSD/Linux
users, in that relatively speaking there are far fewer people
interested in actually contributing work than in simply downloading
the work done by others.  Mike Thomas was of course the heroic
exception in this regard, and his determination of the superiority of
the mingw environment vis a vis the cygwin environment coupled with
his more than ample contributions of time and skill have given us the
mingw system we have today.  I do think we need to discuss the way
forward, for unless we find his equivalent somewhere, it can be argued
that it would be better for us to migrate to a system that can be well
emulated and/or remotely accessed under Linux using familiar tools,
even if those are deficient in other regards with respect to customary
Windows usage.

>From my own perspective, I feel most able to support (in descending
order) Linux, BSD, Solaris, MacOSX, and lastly mingw, and alas it is
likely to remain that way.  We therefore are first in needs of a
Windows porter, and next a MacOSX porter.  I feel that GCL has also
accumulated a certain degree of mingw experimental code which no one
uses to my understanding and should be removed on conceptual grounds.
I.e. japi and anything related to java, the separate windows main
routines, and perhaps some alternative tk stuff if memory serves.  I
think we need to consolidate around unix concepts to the degree
possible given our resources, and provide minimal well centralized
emulations where required, e.g. sbrk.  This means in all likelihood
fork(), unix sockets, etc., which to my limited understanding point
more in the direction of cygwin than mingw.  (2.7.0 has parallel
processing primitives based on fork.  pargcl, an mpi extension, is
also likely to be built by default in 2.7 and higher.  This latter
facility of course just requires a uniform external mpi interface
which I hope we can avoid including with the gcl source as gmp and bfd
are done now.) I don't think we should discontinue mingw so much as
investigate a cygwin alternative which, if proven over time to be
accessible within unix and adequate from the user's perspective, might
eventually become the windows port of choice.

This said, I will turn 180 degrees if anyone would like to step
forward and fill Mike Thomas' shoes. 

Finally, I'm not even familiar with the windows package format
concept, so if anyone would like a binary posted, we need a
volunteer.  I'd be quite happy to provide access to any qualified
individual with interest.

How big will this be?  Who can tell me exactly what that means in

Dear Bill, Kai!

I just tried bar and foo from

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSocketsInSPAD

and with the information

| then access with the url: 
| 
|  http://localhost:8085/directory/or/file

I got it actually to work.  I have two problems, though:

* The stuff I write after "http://localhost:8085" is received by foo in
  all-uppercase always, but I need to preserve case.  Is there a case
  preserving character as "|" in lisp?

* How can I close the socket?

And finally, does this work in MS Windows, too?


Many thanks,

Martin

Sorry, yet another question: How do I have to modify foo

(defun foo (s)
  (let* ((get (read s nil 'eof))
         (fn (and (eq get 'get) (read s nil 'eof))))
    (format t "Got ~S~%~%" fn)
    (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%~%" (if fn 200 403))
    (format t "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%~%" (if fn 200 403))
    (format t "~S~%~%" (SPADCALL fn *docfun*))
    (format s "~S~%~%" (SPADCALL fn *docfun*))
    (close s)))

to make the browser render the html in fn.  I.e., so far I just displayed
strings, which were obtained by applying *docfun* to fn.  But now, 
(SPADCALL fn *docfun*) will actually result in a path like binomial-COMBF.html,
and I want the browser to display that page.

I think it is only because this simple example is using the
READ function which treats the input like a Lisp symbol.
There are other functions for handling the input from
streams like READ-LINE. See a GCL language reference such as

http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/manuals/libs/gcl-si-2.6.7/gcl-si_5.html

Does control-C work? If not, then perhaps there needs to be
a little more code to handle signals. Otherwise for now just
use 'kill' to stop the process from another session.

Yes it works in gcl-2.6.8pre. Unfortunately the current Axiom
binaries for Windows use an older version so you would need
to build Axiom on Windows using build-improvements or by
subsituting gcl-2.6.7pre into the source code from the
axiom--windows--1 tla archive.

You got SPADCALL to work for you - Cool! To bad you have
to write this in Lisp, I would really like to get this
working from SPAD.

> But now, (SPADCALL fn *docfun*) will actually result in

What you need to do is to send an HTTP 'Content-type:'
header as the first two lines of what is sent to the
browser. By default the browser is just treating all
output as text. Try this:

 (defun foo (s)
   (let* ((get (read s nil 'eof))
          (fn (and (eq get 'get) (read-line s nil 'eof))))
     (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%" (if fn 200 403))
     (format s "Content-type: text/html~%~%")
     (format s "<a href='~S'>click here</a>~%" (SPADCALL fn *docfun*))
     (close s)))

You will need to include the same header when sending HTML
data from a file.

(Warning: I haven't actually tested it yet.)

Google for more HTTP references like this one:

http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http

There are also lot of references to HTML such as the link

 <a href='url'> link </a>

generated in the example above. 

HTTP is the low level protocol for sending and receiving
data from a web server. HTML is the mark-up language in which
the data content usually encoded for web browsers.

The (format t ... ) are just for debugging to send some
output to the console so you can see what is happening on
the server.

Oh ... Now that I have had a cup of coffee and woken up a
little, I think that's so typically **brilliant** of you!
That is an excellent idea.

Instead of 'foo' let's just call this little Lisp function
the 'server' and 'bar' is called the 'socket'.

Since what we want is a browser interface for the desktop
why not just use the local file system? We don't need any
kind of especially fast web server because the browser can
read are we can write locally stored files much faster than
anything can be transferred over the Internet.

And this can be made transparent to the user because there
is a particular kind of HTTP response called a "redirection"
which does precisely what you want it to do: It tells the
browser to display a page from some place else. See response
status code 303 at http://jmarshall.com/easy/http

So all your *docfun* Spad function has to do is take the
input from fn, parse it to separate the data fields, do some
calculation, prepare the page, save it on disk in a known
location, and then return the location information to the
server, i.e. the path 'binomial-COMBF-001.html' in your
example. The server forwards this path to the browser as a
redirection and the browser automatically loads your newly
written page. Very Simple.

>      (format s "Content-type: text/html~%~%")
>      (format s "<a href='~S'>click here</a>~%" (SPADCALL fn *docfun*))
>      (close s)))
>

For an automatic redirection all you really need is something
like this:

  (defun server (s)
    (let* ((get (read s nil 'eof))
           (fn (and (eq get 'get) (read-line s nil 'eof))))
      (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%" (if fn 303 403))
      (format s "Location: ~S~%~%" (SPADCALL fn *docfun*))
      (close s)))

Actually what I wrote is not true in the case of a file that
is accessed locally by a web browser. No header is needed in
this case because the browser choices the content-type based
on the file extension. So a page that ends in .html will
automatically treated as mime-type 'text/html'. No problem.

If you use automatic redirection, then you don't need this
in the server, but of course your Spad routines will have to
generate a lot of different HTML commands with embedded data
and graphics. This can even include LaTeX output if we use
the jsMath javascript on the browser.

Actualy with your brilliantly simple idea, we only need to
know a little of the HTTP protocol. You will probably want
to read about the 'POST' command that allows you to send data
from a form or a text area displayed on the browser. This
information can be passed on to *docfun* as input. 

With this simple approach I think it should be quite easy
to implement the HyperDoc functionaliy using a standard web
browser.

OK, that makes sense.

Yes, that's the idea.  In fact, I also want to do some caching, since tex4ht is
rather slow: every function has - by design of axiom - a unique identifier,
namely its signature.  I will use this as the name of the file.  Now, if the
file is there, it can be displayed immediately, otherwise I'll generate it.

that's what I wanted.  


Unfortunately, it doesn't work.  Neither does  

(defun server (s)
   (let* ((get (read s nil 'eof))
          (fn (and (eq get 'get) (read-line s nil 'eof))))
     (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%" (if fn 200 403))
     (format s "Content-type: text/html~%~%")
     (format s "<a href='~S'>click here</a>~%" (SPADCALL fn *docfun*))
     (close s)))

The latter just makes the browser display

Content-type: text/html

<a href='"stretch.html"'>click here</a>

i.e., it doesn't interpret the html.  The former doesn't find "stretch.html" in
the local directory.  Very likely it is looking for

localhost:8080/stretch.html

or some such.

OK, I got it to work now. The important bit was to send

  (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%" blah)

(as you wrote, in fact) instead of

  (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%~%" blah)


The second thing is to send

   file:/absolute/path/to/stretch.html

which is a nuisance.  Isn't there a way to make it read just the local
directory?  Oh well, maybe its even better that way.

Thanks,

Martin

but that only keeps displaying in the Axiom shell window

The other variant works fine, however is quite useless for my purpose.

Is the problem that "Location:" expects a http: specification?  I'm quite
clueless...

There appear to be at least two different errors in the code below.

(defun server (s)
  (let* ((get (read s nil 'eof))
         (fn (and (eq get 'get) (read s nil 'eof))))
    (format t "Got ~S~%~%" fn)
    (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%" (if fn 303 403))
    (format s "Location:
  file:/users/rubey/martin/Axiom/hyperdoc-replacement/stretch.html~%")
    (close s)))

gives

(defun server (s)
  (let* ((get (read s nil 'eof))

    (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%" (if fn 303 403))
    (format s "Location: http://mat.univie.ac.at")
    (close s)))

seems to work

         (fn (and (eq get 'get) (read s nil 'eof))))
    (format t "Got ~S~%~%" fn)

    (format s "Location: ~S~% "http://mat.univie.ac.at")

gives "Got /" forever.

Please Help!

Dear http experts,

(defun server (s)
  (let* ((get (read s nil 'eof))
         (fn (and (eq get 'get) (read s nil 'eof))))
    (format t "Got ~S~%~%" fn)
    (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%" (if fn 303 403))
    (format s "Location: file://localhost/home/martin/martin/Axiom/hyperdoc-replacement/stretch.html~%~%")
    (close s)))

now works with lynx, but gives the acces denied message in konqueror. :-(

I do not have any other browser to try, and I really want it to work with
konqueror anyway.  Whom could I ask?

Don't be too easily discouraged. Because it is a communications
protocol it is necessary to get it *exactly* right for everything
to function. But once it is working, you wont have to change it.

I think file:///... (with 3 slashes) is the correct form.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:_URL

The "host name" goes between the 2nd and 3rd / just like in a
normal http://goggle.com/... the hostname part is omitted in the
case of localhost (but keep the extra /).

To find out the exactly correct local path for this file, try
opening using the the top menu File/Open File. Select the file
by browsing and then open it. The url displayed in the address
line is what you need to send from the server. Here an example
that works with FireFox on my system:

file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Administrator.ASUS/My%20Documents/2=
519
4756_B_store.jpg

Notice that the drive letter C: is the first thing after ///
and also that spaces must be converted to %20 codes.

>=20

That's a syntax error. The string "Location: ~S~%" is a
format. ~S is replaced with a string, ~% is replaced with
a line feed (new line). After the format string comes the
data for the substitutions. So you need:

     (format s "Location: ~S~%" "http://mat.univie.ac.at")

If you key the following at the Lisp (i.e. Boot prompt in
Axiom),

     (format t "Location: ~S~%" "http://mat.univie.ac.at")

You should get exactly the same result as this one with no
substitutions.

     (format t "Location: http://mat.univie.ac.at")

except for an extra blank like.

where t stands for the constand "true" and represents the
'standard out' stream. I recommend you test the format
first with t and later change it to s.

Regards,
Bill Page

Haha ;-)  I spent all saturday on that stupid detail.  In fact, I'm giving up
now.

Thanks.  In fact, that solves the riddle, at least possibly:  it seems that I
am not allowed in mozilla and firefox to do a file:// redirect from a http:
page.  So, it seems we are out of luck?

Yes. But the syntax error happened while pasting into my mail window.  Sorry
about that.  It still won't work.  But I guess, I will be able to solve that
one. The other one is a show-stopper, though.

Martin, don't forget that you also need the name of the category. There 
may be several foo: (%, %) -> % functions from different categories. And 
also think of something like

DomA: with {foo: Integer -> %} == add ...

Thank you very much for looking into this. I am sure that your
idea will prove very useful. Even if it turns out that for
compatibility reasons files have to be served by a web server,
it is not difficult to install one and use it only locally,
e.g. apt-get install apache or zope or even one of the "tiny"
servers like: http://shttpd.sourceforge.net that can be made
(mostly) transparent to a user on both Linux and Windows.

Or we could just add a couple of extra lisp commands to open
and send the contents of the file ourselves. It's not a big
deal. The main thing is that you found a way to call a Spad
routine from within a very small and single web server. That
was really what I was looking for in:

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxSocketsInSPAD

Do you have an explanation why you want/need to use the
*docfun* name format? I recall something about such mangled
names being "global" or in some other way special in scope.
Is that right? Is that why it works, incontrast to the
lambda function I tried? Perhaps rather than "semi-
hardwiring" the name, we could assign it to a local static
variable and use that?

There is a way to chage the configuration of FireFox:

http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work

And Konqueror is supposed to just give a warning. Did you see
that?

Well, that's what I have done now -- following the code in the sandboxsockets
page.  But it's nowhere as nice as the simple redirect.

Oh, I didn't know that this was a problem.  Hm, you did it yourself with
MySort(L,<$Integer)$Lisp, so I do not really follow?

The only thing that was surprising is that the function needs to be compiled,
i.e., defining a function in the interpreter does not work, for some reason.

Thus, I modified bar as below. The only reason I made it a global was that I am
lazy.  You could just as well pass it to server as an argument.

;; try it with

;; )lisp (load "http-test.lisp")
;; BAR(8080, getDocumentation$HyperDoc)$Lisp

(defvar *docfun*)

;; file: http-test.lisp
(defun bar (p docfun)
  (setq *docfun* docfun)
  (let ((s (si::socket p :server #'server)))
    (tagbody l
             (when (si::listen s)
               (let ((w (si::accept s)))
                 (server w)))
             (sleep 0.1)
             (go l))))

(defun server (s)
  (let* ((get (read s nil 'eof))
         (fn (and (eq get 'get) (subseq (string-downcase (read s nil 'eof)) 1))))
; subseq removes the leading "/"
    (format t "Got ~S~%~%" fn)
;;; NOTYET tested
    (when (string= (char fn 1) "?")
        (setq fn (SPADCALL fn *docfun*)))
; *docfun* should return the name of an html file
; in case of an error, it will also return the name of an html file, which will
; contain the error message
;;; END NOTYET tested

    (when (string= (subseq fn (- (length fn) 4)) "html")
        (format s "HTTP/1.1 ~S~%" (if fn 200 403)))

    (with-open-file  (q fn) (si::copy-stream q s))
    (close s)))

No, the stars are only a convention.  defvar makes a variable "global".

Huh? what lambda function did not work for you?

No, he says access denied.  But in any case, we cannot expect a user to fiddle
with security settings.

The "small" webservers, can they be installed without being root?

Nice. Seems ok to me. Since this can be compiled, I expect
it to be pretty fast - for a single user it is probably
faster than the overhead of having more processes running.

It did not work they way I originally wrote it. See bottom of
the page:

Maybe a limitation of the SPADCALL macro?

In my code that's what I tried but I did not use it the same

No, it didn't work. See the bottom of the page. That is the
main reason why I created the page - so I could document this
problem. Maybe it's a bug in GCL? Or maybe it is just I do
not understand how socket function calls server function
internally and that this failure is expected.

Agreed.

Yes, so long as you assign a non-standard port number >1024 and
don't have an aggressive firewall policy.

Dear all,

I just uploaded a tiny toy hyperdoc replacement on MathAction:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxHyperDocReplacement

Please try the code (better in a new directory)!  Especially on MS Windows!

Here is what's missing:

* a way to specify a function completely. The necessary information is:

  name constructor signature

  In libdb.text we find it as follows:
  
  ocount`2`x`(_$,ACMachineInteger)->ACInteger`dExponentialGeneratingSeries``

  (o is for operation, d for domain, c for category) I guess we should stick to
  the same conventions.

  The result of getDocumentation$HyperDoc should be a string which is a legal
  filename on all operating systems we want to support, and it should end with
  ".html"

  It is sufficient to support uniquely determined operations and constructors.
  Adding a search facility as in HyperDoc is easy.

* A LaTeX header file that provides commands supported by HyperTeX, like \spad,
  \spadfun, etc.  For example, \spadfun should transform its argument into the link

  http:\\localhost:8080\?argument

* same thing for ALLPROSE style documentation.

I hope that some of you not occupied with more important things -- like working
on build improvements, waldek sandbox, trunk, or multisort species :-) -- chime
in,

Martin

For knuckledraggers such as myself, could some more detail on how to
start this be added to the page?  How should I load the lisp code, for
example?  How should the spad code be loaded?

Thanks,
Jay

Hi Martin,

I don't understand the LISP part but the SPAD part of

> http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxHyperDocReplacement

looks as if you have achieved quite a lot. Congratulations.

> * A LaTeX header file that provides commands supported by HyperTeX, like \spad,
>   \spadfun, etc.  For example, \spadfun should transform its argument into the link
>

\def\spadfun#1{\href{http://localhost:8080/?#1}

However, that is not going to work if LaTeX special characters are involved.

In order to write a style file I would need to know what commands I 
would have to define. And if I look at the ++ comments of .spad files, I 
have the impression that the htlatex output will not always be perfect 
anyway.

> * same thing for ALLPROSE style documentation.

That is easier. See attachment for a first demo.

However, for full generality, you must be able to ask Axiom not only for 
the name of the function, but also its signature and the type where it 
is defined. The wrapper could be the same for any function/type, but as 
you see in copy.ad there are two definitions that I have added at the 
top (by hand) that do *not* appear in the +++ environment of the 
corresponding .as.nw file. In ALLPROSE this information is generated 
from the accompanying code chunk. Now that you use Axiom, you should get 
that information from somewhere else.

> I hope that some of you not occupied with more important things -- like working

I could probably only help you partially, the difficult part (taking the 
full signature into account and deal with LaTeX special characters) is 
still open.

Happy Sunday
Ralf

Make a new directory (for safety), for example

  mkdir HyperExp
  cd HyperExp

Click on "edit" in

  http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxHyperDocReplacement

Copy & paste everything between \begin{lisp}...\end{lisp} into a file, say

  hyper.lisp

Copy & paste everything between \begin{spad}...\end{spad} into a file, say

  hyper.spad

start axiom:

  axiom
  )co hyper.spad
  )lisp (load "hyper.lisp")

  SOCKET(8080, getDocumentation$HyperDoc)

start a WebBrowser and enter the url http://localhost/|?binomial|

The reason why I embarked on all this is that I noticed that libdb.text
contains all the necessary information!  In particular,

\addefinetype{MyCopyableType}
\addefinename{copy!:(%, %)-> %}

contain just the information contained in the first two fields of the libdb
entry, and it can be retrieved using dbPart$Lisp.

Although it may be stupid from a "do it right" perspective, we can accomplish
something usable easily if we reuse libdb.text (or the databases, that's
roughly the same thing), generate the html and cache it.  This way we do not
need to touch the libdb and database generation at all.

By the way caching, I forgot one ToDo which is quite straightforward:

* remove unused files (like log files) after html generation.

You fall into the "occupied with more important things" category anyway. :-)
(just kidding, don't take this serious)

I know you wanted to test this on Windows also. I do not know if you
got to test it.
This is what I get when doing the last step:

I was thinking the same, but I have a port of grep on my path and I
still get the error.
Maybe Bill knows if I am missing something.

Alfredo, could you please try 

  getDocumentation "binomial"

in the axiom interpreter?  It should start htlatex, and after a while answer
with "binomial.html" Type: String

If this succeeds, then the problem is in the lisp code.  Otherwise, we have a
problem in the spad code.

Martin

Greping sources for GREP indicates that it is indeed undefined.  The
call is in br-search.boot.pamphlet in function grepFile.  Unix version
calls grep, but apparently Alfredo has $standard set to nil, which
means that Axiom is trying to use Windows Saturn interface (and part
of it is removed).

Thank you for the detective work. I am using the windows version of
axiom. Is there any work around? or should I try to compile build-improvements
in windows?

I would go the script way. You call htlatex anyway so one could call a 
helper script that escapes the special characters before handing the 
text to htlatex. It is similar to the aldordoc2tex.pl script.

Oh sorry. You find it attached.

Currently I have only Internet access via Windows and all my work lives 
in the Linux partition. If somebody tells me how to access the Linux 
partition from within Windows (the other way round that's possible) 
without rebooting Linux and using a usbstick that would save me some time.

That is your problem. All I want is that the stuff after

   http://localhost:8080/?

should be designed to contain the full signature and the corresponding 
type where the signature comes from so that the lines

   \addefinetype{MyCopyableType}
   \addefinename{copy!:(%, %)-> %}

can be automatically generated

Wrap the htlatex script with another script that does the remove. Or 
look in ALLPROSE for the html target in Makefile.nw. I copy the relevant 
.html and .png files to the doc/ direcory. After you have done this you 
can remove the whole direcory.

I just say the problem with "grep" not found. For aldordoc2tex.pl you 
need perl. That is probably not installed under Windows, actually, I 
guess, also tex4ht is not the most common program for a Windows user.

I hope you get this working somehow... The definition of \spadfun and 
\spadfunFrom should be done similar to the one in wrapper.tex. 
Unfortunately, I don't know where to look for the all the commands that 
cover the hypertex ++ documentation of the .spad files. So I cannot 
write an appropriate .sty file. I would suggest to use the AldorDoc 
style defined in ALLPROSE anyway. But that would mean transforming the 
++ documenation of all spad file (which nobody will do in the near future).

I think this could work for you: http://www.chrysocome.net/explore2fs,
if your partitions are ext2 or ext3.

This removed the error of GREP on windows(thanks Waldek).

However doing getDocumentation("binomial") I get:

(2) -> getDocumentation "binomial"

   (2)  "error.html"
                                                                 Type: String

I look at the spad code:

            r := ops.eq.(doc::Symbol)
            if empty? r
            then "error.html"

but I do not know what ops.eq.(doc::Symbol) should had returned.

Waldek, could you please explain (maybe a sentence or two)
about what you mean by "Windows Saturn interface"? What is
Saturn? Plus, assuming I did not know the answer, how would
I find out from the Axiom documentation and source code?

Thanks.

Saturn is a name of a user interface in Nag Axiom.  This interface
(or at least part of it) were used in Windows version.

> 

Is it a trick question?  Souce code mention Saturn many times
without saying what it is.  One can deduce that it has something
to do with user interface and that it is probably a Windows thing,
for example in patches.lisp we had:

;; browser stuff:
#+:UNIX (defvar |$standard| 't)
#-:UNIX (defvar |$standard| 'nil)
#+:UNIX (defvar |$saturn| 'nil)
#-:UNIX (defvar |$saturn| 't)

But to find out more (and what I wrote is almost all that I know
about Saturn) you need to read this mailing list (Saturn were
mentioned few times during user interface discussions).

Thank you! :-)

I expect that the only reason for this is the people involved
in trying to get the open source version of Axiom to work had
little idea about this. I know I didn't know because I was one
of them. :-)

No, I certainly did not intend it as a "trick". I think it is
important for others to understand how to answer questions
like this about Axiom. At this point to learn how to find
answers is even more important that the actual answsers

Yes, amazing and frustrating, no? I think we must do our best
to avoid this happening in the future!

That's a good point. In fact this questions was originally
answered more than 3 years ago even before we knew what
question to ask. :-)

Greg (Vanuxem Gregory) originally pointed out the point
about the "saturn flag" in

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-12/msg00129.html

concerning comparison between output of windows version
and the linux version of Axiom. The original query about
the "saturn code" came from Mike Thomas

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-11/msg00172.html

when he was working hard to get the first version of
open source Axiom to compile on Windows.

Tim Daly referred to the "Saturn interface (which is no
techexplorer)" here:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2004-06/msg00054.html

Even more relevant is the following post by Mike Dewar:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-10/msg00022.html

"The main file in question was br-saturn.boot ("saturn" was IBM's
pre-release name for TechExplorer) and we also used the $saturn
variable to test whether we were in TechExplorer or not in a few
places (this was so we could use the same CCL image files for both
the TechExplorer and shell interfaces of Axiom under Windows).
It might be worth somebody trying to resurrect this code - the only
hitch I can foresee is that we added a grep command to CCL (coded
in C) since Windows doesn't have a grep program, but you can always
spawn off a system command under Unix (which is what the original
IBM version of Axiom did) to get the same result."

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2003-09/msg00234.html

"In particular we had a TeX-based browser interface which
you could wire in in place of )show, )what etc.  

The code for this lived in the file br-saturn.boot ("saturn" was
the codename for TechExplorer before IBM released it) and was not
included by default in the Unix build.  It modified the Lisp
commands kSearch, cSearch, dSearch etc. to produce TeX output
with embeded hyperlinks."

Dear Alfredo,

it seems that your axiom is too old.  I remember that database access was also
broken in the Linux version, probably until Waldek entered the picture.

What is needed is the following:

  ops := getDatabase("o")$OperationsQuery

should return a number somewhat larger than 6000 (sixthousand)

  ops.(name="binomial").doc

should return a list of docstrings for the various implementations of binomial.

Anybody knows which version is the most windows friendly to support this?  DOes
it work in build-improvements or in patch-50?

Martin

Thanks Martin. That makes sense.

Is Waldek branch able to compile in Windows or is it missing anything
significant from
build-improvements to achieve this?

Alfredo, what version of Axiom on Windows are you using for
this test?

It is not possible (yet) to compile wh-sandbox on Windows.
I am working on it. Any help would be appreciated.

I just checked. On Linux,

does *not* work.

                        AXIOM Computer Algebra System

              Timestamp: Friday November 17, 2006 at 16:54:07

seems to work

                        AXIOM Computer Algebra System
             Version: Axiom build-improvements branch 2006-11-26
              Timestamp: Wednesday March 14, 2007 at 02:25:47

seems to work

I write "seems", since I do not have a reliable set of axiom versions.  These
are just the versions which happen to be on my harddisk, except the first one.

Hi Bill,

> Alfredo, what version of Axiom on Windows are you using for

                        AXIOM Computer Algebra System
               Version of Monday January 17, 2005 at 22:31:38

In http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomBinaries it says version 0.1.4.

Anything I can do to help just let me know. Martin just emailed that
build-improvements seems to have browsing the databases working.

Regards,

Alfredo

A good first step would be to re-compile a new version of
Axiom for Windows using the build-improvements sources.

Bill,

> A good first step would be to re-compile a new version of

I did steps 1, 2 and 3 from: http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/BuildAxiom
to build axiom on windows. I check out build-improvements branch.
What else do I need before I try to compile it. How would it affect that
build-improvements do not compile noweb anymore (hope I am correct
about that last statement), do i need to install it manually?

Alfredo

Could you write what problems do you see?  Gaby wrote that on
Windows one needs realtive paths -- this part in not merged
into wh-sandbox (mechanical merge gives me build failures on
Linux and the changes conflict with other patches that I am
working on, so this will take some time).  

Algebra and interp directories in wh-sandbox are significantly
differenet than in build-improvements, but I hope that there
is little (or maybe no) differences (beyond paths issues) affecting
portability.

In other subdirectories of src the diff below summarizes unmerged parts:

That should be ok.

That is correct.

Yes. See:

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/AxiomSilverBranch

You can use the version of gcl that is in build-improvements but
you must now install noweb your self.

Bill Page.

Dear Ralf,

do you happen to know how to make htlatex generate links to style files
etc. enclosed in vertical bars?  For example, I have the following file:

 factorial`(_$)->_$`CombinatorialFunctionCategory.tex

sending it through htlatex, I get the following reference in
factorial`(_$)->_$`CombinatorialFunctionCategory.html:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="factorial`(_$)->_$`CombinatorialFunctionCategory.css">

but I'd rather have

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="|factorial`(_$)->_$`CombinatorialFunctionCategory.css|">

Is there an easy way to accomplish this?

I would like to avoid having to replace all "bad" characters like $ and ` with
others, but I realize that, in fact, that's what you advised me to do anyway.

Thanks,

Martin

When the build is compiling gcl, it stops with this error:

 to `__gmpn_popcount'

Hmmm...

Did you checkout build-improvements directly to your
windows system. What revision do you have?

I have

$ svn info
Path: .
URL:
https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom/branches/build-improvements
Repository Root: https://axiom.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/axiom
Repository UUID: 54bea96e-1511-0410-8851-aaeae44645fa
Revision: 512
Node Kind: directory

----

Are you doing an "out-of-source" build? E.g. If

  /e/build-improvements

is your build-improvements source checked out from svn,
then building out-of-source would look like this:

  $ mkdir /e/axiom
  $ cd /e/axiom
  $ ../build-improvements/configure
  $ make

Could you please try the following:

  $ cd/e/axiom/gcl
  $ make clean
  $ ./configure
  $ make

Do you get the same error? If this works you can do

  $ make install

that will install gcl in the '/usr/local/bin'. If

  $ echo $PATH

shows '/usr/local/bin' in the path, then build-improvements
will use that.

On my system I used the above procedure to put gcl in
/usr/local/bin because I am also working with wh-sandbox
which does not include even gcl.

Regards,
Bill Page.

Gaby,

In my email:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2006-12/msg00167.html

I described Mike Thomas' portability changes for windows. I have
applied these to build-improvements and tested both the Windows
and Solaris 10 x86 builds but more extensive testing is probably
a good idea. The diff from SVN is attached to this email and
affects the files shown below:

$ svn status
...
M      src\interp\daase.lisp.pamphlet
M      src\interp\nlib.lisp.pamphlet
M      src\interp\sys-pkg.lisp.pamphlet
M      src\interp\construc.lisp.pamphlet
M      src\interp\cfuns.lisp.pamphlet
M      src\interp\i-syscmd.boot.pamphlet
M      src\lib\cfuns-c.c.pamphlet
...

Could you look especially at the patches to the file
'cfuns-c.c.pamphlet'? In this case had to merge autoconf-
related changes from build-improvements with Mike's changes.
Although I followed the pattern in the existing code, I am
less confident that I used the #ifdef S_ ... #endif
conditons properly.

I think these changes should be attributed to Mike Thomas
in the ChangeLog.

These changes are necessary in order to run Axiom on Windows
so I think they should go into build-improvements at your
convenience. (I am still using autoconf-2.61 so I prefer if
you commit rather than me.) Meanwhile as outlined in the above
email, I will continue to make similar portability changes in
other parts of the Axiom code.

Regards,
Bill Page.

I am not convinced that it is necessary to use relative paths
but it does seem to be true that absolute paths can lead to
some trouble. The main cause of the trouble is the MSYS build
environment itself. The "base" of all paths in MSYS is the
root where MSYS was installed. So for example:

  $ cd /
  $ pwd
  /
  $ pwd -W
  C:/msys/1.0

The new option -W for pwd tells that actual Windows path using
/ where Windows normally uses \.

But if I pass a path beginning with / to a native Windows
application produced by MSYS then it does *not* treat / as
equivalent to 'C:\msys\1.0' but rather just 'C:\'. In MSYS it
is possible to specify an "absolute" path like this:

  $ cd /c/wspage
  $ pwd
  /c/wspage
  $ pwd -W
  c:/wspage

So that both MSYS and Windows agree on the "base", but of course
Windows applications do not understand '/c' as referring to
'c:\' unless there exists a link (windows short-cut) in the
root of the current drive with the name 'c' that points to 'c:\'.
This is possible, but awkard to create.

But in brief, this is kind of a mess in MSYS. There is a similar
situation in cygwin but in that case it does not cause problems
if you only build and use cygwin applications because the cygwin
library takes care of the path names. But this is not possible
in MSYS because the target applications are native windows apps.

The old axiom--windows--1 build for Axiom on Windows got around
this by very carefully using a combination of `pwd` and `pwd -W`
to get the right "absolute" path depending on whether it was a
path in an MSYS command or a path in the application code,
respectively.

Gaby's solution to this problem is to use only relative paths.
Occassionally this looks a little weird with paths involving
unresolved things like 'src/share/doc/../../algebra' but at
least both Windows and the MSYS build environment treat these
the same way.

Another solution would be add a new concept of "base path" to
the build machinery so that windows applications like gcl and
the Axiom intermediaries are always given Windows absolute paths
while the MSYS tools see only MSYS absolute paths. But maybe
this would seem overly obscure to most linux developers.

There is also a problem in GCL on Windows when passing
arguments via -exec that contain subdirectory paths that
forces the use of echo and pipe, i.e.

  echo '(compile "foo/bar"

I think that is true.

I did not notice anything in the diff which might cause
problems (but then I often do not notice what the computer
seems to catch on almost every first attempt ... :)

In return I am sending you the following diff which shows the
current set of local changes that I have made to wh-sandbox
in an attempt to get it to compile under Windows. So far I am
still not successful. Some of these changes I may revert as
I find better ways to deal with the problems.

Dear all,

I have now nearly everything working -- that is, in a very basic sense --
except I have one tiny problem:

I wanted to use things like

stretch`(_$,ACMachineInteger)->_$`dCycleIndexSeries.html

as filenames, but that turned out to be problematic.

Does somebody know an easy way to transform a given string bijectively into a
-- preferably short! -- string that can be used as a filename.  Of course, it
should also work well on windows.

I was thinking of creating an md5 checksum and use that, but it appears
suboptimal to me, since it is not really bijective and looks too complicated.


Martin

Hi Martin, look into ALLPROSE. Compile a .dvi File and then hover over a 
link in the Exports part of a type.

My DviViewer shows something like

#.2=:MyPrimitiveType:[.PER,PER.]->Boolean

for something like

   ~=: (%, %) -> Boolean

I also had to translate round brackets into square ones, since hyperref 
forgot everything after the first closing (or was it opening) parenthesis.

This translation also happens in tools/aldordoc2tex.pl. I am sure you 
can adjust it.

Ah, and as you can see, I included the name of the type in the link.

And make sure you remove ">" from the filename. Otherwise it will be 
hard to remove that file.

Why do you need bijectivity at all? All you want is a cache, right? So 
md5 seems OK to me.

I don't speak perl.  Furthermore, I'd also like to have compression.

Apart from this, I find it problematic that file names will become very long
this way.

Well, for the moment I think it's ok, even though md5 is not even injective.
But I thought that it would be better to have something bijective to be remain
more flexible.


I would have thought that gzip -c | somesimpleencoder would be ideal for that
purpose.  But I couldn't find any encoder that uses only letters and digits.

The following message is a courtesy copy of an article
that has been posted to comp.lang.lisp as well.

Dear all,

finally I know what I want: a base32 encoder. Anybody has one available?

thanks,

Martin

Ralf,

could you teach me how to use

http://search.cpan.org/dist/MIME-Base32/Base32.pm

I want to do something like

echo "binomial`(_$,_$)->_$`OutputForm" | gzip -c | base32


Well, additionally I have the problem that I somehow need to get this into a
string variable within axiom.




Many thanks,

Martin

As of revision 513 wh-sandbox should build both with CLtL1 gcl
and Ansi gcl.  There is good chance that it will build and run
in gcl (safety 3) mode -- 513 contains fixes for all problem that
I observed in such build, but I still have to do a clean run from
start to end (safe build take more than 16 hours).

In a private tree I also managed to build wh-sandbox using sbcl,
but there are problems in some tests and some changes does not
look good.  I commited most of obvious fixes to 513, but the
rest will take some time.

Compression of what? The filename? For ALLPROSE I wanted the Hyperlink 
(actually xdvik) to show a bit of information in a readable form (the 
type where the function comes from). That was the only reason why I made 
the link name human readable. I only had the restriction of hyperref and 
  perhaps TeX's memory, but not more.

Do you really think that you can find two signatures in Axiom that have 
the same md5 code? What is the probability of that?

somesimpleencoder = base64encoder

Dear all,

I believe I've got it working now, at least on linux.  Maybe some Windows users
could try the new version, too.

prerequesites: 

I use

* tex4ht  to convert tex to html
* md5sum  to make a nice url out of a signature
  
     (does md5sum myspec > md5spec work on windows, when myspec contains some
      text to be md5summed?)

* rm      to remove a file
     (does rm *.{log,4tc,4ct,lg,tmp,aux,dvi,idv,xref,css} work on windows?)

otherwise, go to 

http://wiki.axiom-developer.org/SandBoxHyperDocReplacement

and follow the steps there.
 
I will not work on beautifying things.  Maybe, I will add support for links (a
la \spadfun and \spad) and maybe I will add support to search for Constructors.

Waldek, do you know how I get the lists of attributes, uses, users and
dependents?



Hope this leads somewhere,

Martin

I did not receive a new version from you.  But since you say that obvious
patch is OK in revision 513 I just removed the second copy of the

EXCELLENT news!  Very impressive work.

A question - is there a configure option at the Axiom toplevel to build
GCL in ANSI mode if using the in-tree GCL, or does this need GCL
installed externally?  Not a major problem, I'd just like to test
correctly.

Thanks for all your efforts!

Yes, that's exactly what I was after.  I stick with md5sum for the moment,
since this has "compression" built in, but together with

http://common-lisp.net/project/gzip-stream/

it is certainly better than md5.

Note that my code is quite flexible with respect to this problem.  The function
in question is

        getSpecification(op: IndexCard): String == 
            s: String := concat([op.'name, "`", op.'type, "`", op.'origin])
            systemCommand("sys rm myspec")$MoreSystemCommands
            f: TextFile := open("myspec"::FileName, "output")
            writeLine!(f, s)
            close! f
            systemCommand("sys md5sum myspec > md5spec")$MoreSystemCommands
            f: TextFile := open("md5spec"::FileName, "input")
            r := readLine! f
            close! f
            r.(1..32)

It's sole purpose is to translate

            s: String := concat([op.'name, "`", op.'type, "`", op.'origin])

at least injectively into a filename.  As you can see it currently uses file IO
and md5sum, even though md5 is not injective, but nearly...

But it would be better to avoid file IO and call these two lisp utilities
instead.  And of course, the proper way would be to write a tiny wrapper
package for rfc3548.lisp and another one for gzip-stream, but I'm not going to
do it.

Martin

ANSI GCL must be installed externally, use --with-lisp=/path/to/lisp
configure option to choose which Lisp is used for build.

src/interp/construc.lisp.pamphlet is unused and probably will
be deleted, the changes to it are likely to be wrong.

The change to src/interp/daase.lisp.pamphlet looks good
(but one needs more changes for real portability).

The change to src/interp/nlib.lisp.pamphlet is reasonable, but
I probably would like to do it in a different way to have
varsion which is not gcl specific.

src/interp/sys-pkg.lisp.pamphlet of course have to be kept in sync
with other changes.

Changes to src/lib/cfuns-c.c.pamphlet look backwards: 
  CLgetpid is unused and was removed
  addtopath is unused and probably should be removed
  current code in directoryp should be more portable then Mike's
    version
  change to make_path_from_file should be conditional (Mike's
  version will mishandle Unix files which have backslashes in
  their name)
  in readablep and writeablep what matters for you is probably
  the final "return 1;" statement (which effectivly disables
  permission checking on Windows).

Programming Languages for Mechanized Mathematics Workshop

As part of Calculemus 2007
<http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/>
Hagenbergs, Austria
June 29-30, 2007.

The intent of this workshop is to examine more closely the intersection=20
between
programming languages and mechanized mathematics systems (MMS). By MMS, w=
e
understand computer algebra systems (CAS), [automated] theorem provers
(TP/ATP), all heading towards the development of fully unified systems (t=
he
MMS), sometimes also called universal mathematical assistant systems=20
(MAS) (see
Calculemus 2007
<http://www.risc.uni-linz.ac.at/about/conferences/Calculemus2007/>).

There are various ways in which these two subjects of /programming=20
languages/ and /systems for mathematics/ meet:

   * Many systems for mathematics contain a dedicated programming
     language. For instance, most computer algebra systems contain a
     dedicated language (and are frequently built in that same
     language); some proof assistants (like the Ltac language for Coq)
     also have an embedded programming language. Note that in many
     instances this language captures only algorithmic content, and
     /declarative/ or /representational/ issues are avoided.
   * The /mathematical languages/ of many systems for mathematics are
     very close to a functional programming language. For instance the
     language of ACL2 is just Lisp, and the language of Coq is very
     close to Haskell. But even the mathematical language of the HOL
     system can be used as a functional programming language that is
     very close to ML and Haskell. On the other hand, these languages
     also contain very rich specification capabilities, which are
     rarely available in most computation-oriented programming
     languages. And even then, many specification languages (B, Z,
     Maude, OBJ3, CASL, etc) can still teach MMSes a trick or two
     regarding representational power.
   * Conversely, functional programming languages have been getting
     "more mathematical" all the time. For instance, they seem to have
     discovered the value of dependent types rather recently. But they
     are still not quite ready to 'host' mathematics (the non-success
     of docon <http://www.haskell.org/docon/> being typical). There are
     some promising languages on the horizon (Epigram
     <http://www.e-pig.org/>, Omega
     <http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Esheard/Omega/index.html>) as well as
     some hybrid systems (Agda <http://agda.sourceforge.net/>, Focal
     <http://focal.inria.fr/site/index.php>), although it is unclear if
     they are truly capable of expressing the full range of ideas
     present in mathematics.
   * Systems for mathematics are used to prove programs correct. (One
     method is to generate "correctness conditions" from a program that
     has been annotated in the style of Hoare logic and then prove
     those conditions in a proof assistant.) An interesting question is
     what improvements are needed for this both on the side of the
     mathematical systems and on the side of the programming languages.

We are interested in all these issues. We hope that a certain synergy wil=
l
develop between those issues by having them explored in parallel.

These issues have a very colourful history. Many programming language
innovations first appeared in either CASes or Proof Assistants, before
migrating towards more mainstream languages. One can cite (in no particul=
ar
order) type inference, dependent types, generics, term-rewriting,=20
first-class
types, first-class expressions, first-class modules, code extraction, and=
 so
on. However, a number of these innovations were never aggressively=20
pursued by
system builders, letting them instead be developped (slowly) by programmi=
ng
language researchers. Some, like type inference and generics have=20
flourished.
Others, like first-class types and first-class expressions, are not=20
seemingly
being researched by anyone.

We want to critically examine what has worked, and what has not. Why are =
all
the current ``popular''[1] computer algebra systems untyped? Why are the
(strongly typed) proof assistants so much harder to use than a typical=20
CAS? But
also look at question like what forms of polymorphism exists in mathemati=
cs?
What forms of dependent types exist in mathematics? How can MMS regain th=
e
upper hand on issues of 'genericity'? What are the biggest barriers to=20
using a
more mainstream language as a host language for a CAS or an ATP?

This workshop will accept two kinds of submissions: full research papers =
as
well as position papers. Research papers should be nore more than 15=20
pages in
length, and positions papers no more than 3 pages. Submission will be=20
through
_EasyChair_. An informal version of the proceedings will be available at =
the
workshop, with a more formal version to appear later. We are looking into
having the best papers completed into full papers and published as a spec=
ial
issue of a Journal (details to follow).

Waldek,

I have finally succeeded in building wh-sandbox on Windows. 
I have attached the patch set with diffs against revision 515. 
My approach was to introduce a "BASE" variable as I discussed
in a previous email to allow the Windows applications to have
a different absolute path than the MSYS tools used during the
build. This is in contrast to Gaby's approach of making all paths
relative. In the end this seemed like the shortest path to getting
wh-sandbox to compile under Windows. 

Please let me know what you think about this approach. 

I will continue to test this patchset to make sure that it does
not break the linux build. 

Regards,
Bill Page.

This is a set of patches against revision 515 of wh-sandbox.

WOW! It remains to get the graphics working, I guess.  I had a small
presentation today, but people where dismayed by the fact that there is no
help, no graphics under MS windows.

And of course, they really want a better expression domain, i.e., provisos.

I guess, both is out of reach for the moment?

My test build of wh-sandbox (rev. 515) plus the patches for
Windows just completed normally and runs simple confidence
tests. with errors on the axiom-developer.org Linux server
(RedHat 9+). 

I have also checked that this patch set is independent of the
earlier changes for portability and they both can be applied
simultaneously. 

Waldek, I have modified the portability patch set, as you
suggested in your previous email, to remove the regression
of the cfuns-c socket code and drop the patch to the obsolete
'construc' function. Would you like me to commit either or
both of these patch sets to wh-sandbox? Note: One of the
revisions that I pulled from build-improvements triggers the
requirement for autoconf >= 2.60. 

Gaby, the portability changes are also applicable to the
build-mprovements branch. Would you like me to make an
initial commit? There will be more (less critical) changes
like this to follow. 

Regards,
Bill Page

Congratulations.  Few quick remarks about the diff:

1) It does not apply cleanly to 515 (I had problem with
   README.build-improvements, configure.ac.pamphlet and
   src/interp/sys-pkg.lisp.pamphlet)
2) Some parts seem to be whitespace-only diff (differnces
   in whitespace probably are responsible for failures in 1)
3) Use of '(in-package \"boottran\")' in document.in is wrong,
   because in Ansi Lisp the package name here is case sensitive,
   so we want '(in-package \"BOOTTRAN\")'
4) Do you really need subshells in src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet?

Perhaps one cause of the apparent whitespace differences
has to do with the annoyance of different line endings between
Linux and Windows. SVN for Windows automatically terminates
lines with CR+LF, but the MSYS tools assume normal Unix
convention of just newline (LF). 

I would prefer if we set the EOL attributes on the SourceForge
SVN repository so that SVN does not mangle line endings
in this way. But this is just an inconvenient a fact-of-life for
Windows developers. Most Windows and MSYS tools are
tolerant for these differences but some are not. When I
produced the patch file I sent you, I filtered it by tr -d '\r' to
convert back to Unix line endings. 

A significant thing to remember about MSYS is that it is really
a cross-compilation/porting environment intended to produce
native Windows applications from Unix-oriented sources. It is
not quite a native development environment for Windows (like
Visual C, for example).

Ok. BTW, the build I did of wh-sandbox on Windows was using
the ANSI mode of GCL. I have compiled the same sources under
Linux using CLtL1. Thank you very much for resolving the
differences that make it possible to use GCL in ANSI mode. 
I did not realize that it would also be possible to use a dialect
of GCL that was compatible with *both*. This is a nice feature to
try to retain at least during the transition to full ANSI compliance.

Subshells make it easier to make local changes to the current
directory to avoid some path issues. But, no they are probably
not needed in a more careful design.

Ok. I am in favour of eliminating as much of this cruft as
possible (before we start adding more of our own ;).

I am not sure if I understand what you call the "underlying
problem". Do you mean the fact that Axiom's pamphlet
files group code into "chunks" that may not correspond to
files at the lowest level? I suppose the model that we want
to present to the user is: "Axiom's source code as a set
of literate documents...". How these documents are woven
from text and code chunks is (mostly) our problem. But
what the build machinery needs is the chunks of various
pamphlets organized into files. I worry that the tools we
have for doing this right now (e.g. noweb, make stanzas,
and even awk scripts) are a little too primitive. 

>    The same solution should work for build. 

Again, I am not sure exactly sure to what "solution" you
are referring, but if you mean continuing the use of an
intermediate file system-oriented view of the source code,
then I suppose that right now we have no other option. 

>    But if we have to use gross hacks to get around build

I don't view the introduction of a "BASE" variable as a gross
hack. But this is different than what I did in two cases marked
"hack #1 billpage in the Makefile.pamphlet source. In that
case I made use of the intermediate directory as a temporary
staging area for both the input and output files. A 'cd' to change
the current directory eliminates one absolute path and the use
of a 'mv' command moves the other path out of the native
environment (Windows) and back into the development
environment (MSYS). But as you say this could have been
handled by the use of $(BASE) instead. So can I assume
that you would be in favor of the latter option?

I understand your point. What I tried to do was to use
'svn merge' just to pull as much as possible an entire
revision from build-improvements into wh-sandbox. My
thinking was that this might prevent problems in the future
in the case of an eventual merge of both build-improvements
and wh-sandbox back into the "Axiom Silver" trunk. But
where we are going with this is not clear to me yet.

That is correct. I think there are advantages and disadvantages
of either choice. In favor of retaining the unused (but "standard")
autoconf variables is in the eventual move to a complete
automated make environment. (I think that was Gaby's original
intent.) In which case, as you say, this complexity would be
hidden by the machinery. The question is then: how much of
this can we tolerate now? Maybe the answer is different
between build-improvements and wh-sandbox... For now I will
try to eliminate the unused variables in my patch wh-sandbox,
but doing so requires a little more analysis. 

> 8) Concerning BASE variable: it does not look nice, but

>

I agree. If we can afford the divergence of the code between
wh-sandbox and build-improvements then it makes sense
to experiment with two rather opposite solutions to the same
problem.

No, AFAICS differences are due to trailing spaces -- actually it
seems that we have hundreds of lines with trailing whitespece
while IMHO such lines should be extremally rare (that is all
useless trailing whitespece should be stripped).

This setting is intended as a convenience for Windows developers...
And it seems to work -- at least it seems that the repository
is free from unwanted carriage returns.

I appreciate advantages of subshells.  But on some platforms
(including Windows) subshells are rather slow to create, so
we probably want to avoid them in performance critical parts.

The shell code in question is _not_ performance critical, but
since the only change to src/algebra/Makefile.pamphlet I see 
(or did I overlook something?) is introduction of subshells
I would like to know if there is a special problem here that
braces have but subshells avoid.

No.  Extraction from pamphlets is a different problem.

I am specifically referring to:

 $(addsuffix .$(FASLEXT), $(IN_from_MID)): \
     %.$(FASLEXT) : $(MID)/%.clisp
-       @ echo 10 making $@ from $<
-       @ ( B=`pwd`;\
+       @ echo 10a making $@ from $< # hack 1 by Bill Page
+       # avoid paths in file names for Windows compatibility

(and the hack 2).  The `pwd` command I put there is already a hack
to work around fact that meaning of relative :output parameter to
compile-file is implementation dependent.  In principle using

:output (merge-pathnames "$@") 

should help but I still had problems after doing that, so
I used `pwd` as temporary hack before I get :output working
in consistent way.  

But if using separate directory here causes extra problems, 
I think that we can just put all .clisp in single directory.

Above I used wrong words.  Given problem $(BASE) is a logical
solution.  Your 'cd'  + 'notdir' + 'mv' combination is also a
logical solution, if we _have to_ keep current files loctions.
But it is getting heavy, and we may put .clisp files in current
directory which should solve problem in 'IN_from_MID' rule
and simplify solution to 'AUTO_from_MID' rule

I am trying to avoid unnecessary differences.  But IMHO global
variables (even unused ones) significantly increase complexity and
consequently we should limit use of them.  In particular
I think that we should decide at merge time if we really
want the variables in question.  Of course the problem may
solve itself earlier: the variables may turn out to be
usefull ones.  But ATM the difference is to remind us about
the problem.

Please do.  I would probably first add no new variables and
then look which new variables are used by the rest of the patch and
which exisiting values changed.

ATM I use autoconf 2.59 and I would prefer to stay with this
version.  AFAICS the problem is that autoconf 2.59 does not
set value of 'top_builddir'.  So the following changes to
variable settings are problematic:

-build_libdir = $(abs_top_builddir)/src/lib
+build_libdir = $(top_builddir)/src/lib

+axiom_top_builddir = $(top_builddir)/build
+axiom_builddir = $(axiom_top_builddir)/$(build)
-axiom_configdir = $(abs_top_builddir)/config
+axiom_configdir = $(top_builddir)/config

Thanks.  I had had no reliable connection in Europe (UK+France) for

Thanks.  
I wish more people will build Axiom with checking on and help

First note a subtle differences of former noweb support and the thing
I added back:

1) I added back support for tarball (which in the past seemed to work
   resonably well)
2) The tarball itself is optional: by default configure will use installed
   noweb.  If there is no installed noweb configure will look for tarball
   and if the tarball is present then noweb will be built.  If there is
   no installed noweb and no tarball then configure will stop with error
   message.

Why I added back this code?  I belive that noweb itself should not be
part of Axiom svn repository.  But it is reasonable to create Axiom
"source distribution" which bundles Axiom and all troublesome
prerequisites to make build easier.  The added back code is intended
to help create such distribution.

Let me restate my position: in general I am against putting souces of
prerequisities (especially as tarballs, but unpacked form is also bad)
in Axiom svn repositiry.  Of course, sometimes we want to make an
exception but I do not see any reason in case of noweb.  But this does
not exclude having helper code which make use of prerequisities easier.

ENV disappeared from Axiom.build-improvements long time ago.

Please go on with portability patch.  

Concerning Windows build, attached you will find modified version
of your patch (diff with respect to revision 517).  I eliminated extra
variable settings from config/var-def.mk -- this is likely to break
Windows build, but fixed autoconf 2.59 problem.  Also, 517 changes
one of the variable setting differently than your original patch.
So there is probably some work to find out which settings in 
config/var-def.mk are needed for Windows.

I eliminated use of MID directory from src/interp/Makefile.pamhlet
-- this should make path problems easier.

One extra comment: change to src/lisp/Makefile.pamhlet loads 
initial-env.lisp which in turn creates BOOTTRAN package -- that
is why change to src/interp/sys-pkg.lisp.pamphlet is needed.

Could you merge the attached patch with your original one (and if
possible consider also comments from other mails) so that it works
both of Windows and Linux?  Assuming new version works OK please
go on and commit.

BTW.  I will be leaving out town for few days, so I will probably be
unable to immediatly look at your final version.

One remark: I dislike both ENV and AX_FLAGS (to say the truth I dislike
AX_FLAGS more than ENV).  So, the change to wh-sandbox is _not_ a
mechanical merge from build-improvements -- wh-sandbox moves remaininig
part of ENV (most could be dropped after other changes) to 'var-def.mk'.
This causes some breakage (the NOISE variable does not work as originally
intended) which ATM I consider tolerable (and I intend to fix when
re-working NOISE).

Ah, it is a matter of dislike :-/

I'll very much appreciate to be enlightened about where all this is
going.  If you plan a merge back to build-improvements, then I suspect
it is more productive to refrain from gratuitous incompatibilities
based on dislike.  If you don't plan merge back to build-improvements,
please let us know.

Of course: I am not payed for working on Axiom, so I do this because
I like it :-).  And I think that other Axiom developers care how
the code looks like for the same reason...

I wrote you few months ago that IMHO AX_FLAGS potentially has the similar
problems to ENV.  You do not consider AX_FLAGS problematic so you call
my change gratuitous.  But since I do not agree with your opinion about
AX_FLAGS I also do not agree with calling it gratuitous.  I am trying to
avoid unnecessary differences, but since I am maintaining wh-sandbox
I feel that ultimatly it is to me to judge what is necessary.

Concerning merge: I did a substantial work to reduce differnces between
build-improvements and wh-sandbox and I will help doing merge.  But
the outcame will largely depend on you: AFAIK you object to many
changes in wh-sandbox so there I problem with wholesale merge.  I am
willing to help identify idependent parts or modify offending code.
But if we find too many places where our opinions differ than the
merge will turn into cherry picking and it is only you who can
cherry pick to build-improvements.

Of course, everybody cares about how the code looks like.  However, it
had seemed to me that we introduced incompatibilities on technical
grounds, not just because we disliked the spelling of something.

ENV presents far more *technical* problems than AX_FLAGS does, because ENV
does already have a meaning for most POSIX environments.

If you did and I did not address your objections, then I must have missed
the message.

AX_FLAGS presents far less technical problems than ENV does; in fact,
I would be very much interested in the problems you see with AX_FLAGS
that is not present with ENV.  

I asked for technical reasons, the serious reason I have been offered
is that "you dislike it more than ENV".  THAT reads "gratuituous"
difference in my book.

Well, I do no insist that you merge back to build-improvements if your
taste dictates you refrain from doing so.  However, I do appreciate to
know where the changes are going.

  I don't know what this means; I've not seen it before.
Do you have the gcl config.log around?  It might be a good idea to
have Camm look at it.

Axiom build with this patch fails numerous tests, for example
calculus2.input.  AFAICS runtime compilation is broken: the comiler
can not read back intermediate files it wrote.  ATM I do not see what
is the reason, but the only Lisp related change seems to be to 
src/lisp/Makefile.pamphlet, my first guess is that initial-env.lisp
is causing the problem.

It is probably false alarm: I just noticed that I made a mistake
and build Axiom based on gcl-2.6.6 -- this is likely the reason
for test failures.

Those originally done by Mike Thomas. That is that patch
that I sent you earlier. My point is just that those
changes and the patches I made more recently to wh-sandbox
to build on Windows are orthogonal.

I hope that it is clear that I intend to continue to work on wh-sandbox
independently of possible merge.  In particular work in progress
includes:
 - sbcl port (bootstraps in private tree but fails some tests)
 - database bootstrap (database seem to build correctly, but
   has some problems which needs to be resolved)
 - removals of unused code from compiler/interpreter (I have
   sizable hunks waiting for removal).

I consider current wh-sandbox "almost ready" for merge (there are some
cleanups worth doing but they should be relatively small).  

svn diff between wh-sandbox and build-improvements is probably quite
large, mostly due to file removals.  If we do not take into account
files which are entirely (or almost entirely) removed and algebra
files (where wh-sandbox removed bootstrap Lisp) we get a diff of
780 kb (20456 lines).  The bulk of this is in interp directory
(about 11000 lines).  The second large piece is graph subdirectory
(about 3000 lines).  The next is new asq program.  Other changes
are relatively small.

Graph subdirectory should be a no brainer -- beside not having
AX_FLAGS in the Makefile.pamphlet the rest is prototype conversion
and one or two rather trivial bug fixes.

New asq has slightly different output compared to old one but in general
should work better.

Both graph and asq should be independent of other changes.

Well, enough for today: I will summarize other changes later.

In principle I agree with this, however where should this
"helper code" look for the tarball? And what name?

Your revision 517 uses:

+	  $(TAR) -zxf $(axiom_optional_srcdir)/noweb-2.10a.tgz && \

...

+                yes) if test -f $axiom_top_srcdir/zips/noweb-2.10a.tgz ;
then
+                         axiom_build_noweb=yes
+                     else
+                         { { echo "$as_me:$LINENO: error:
--with-included-noweb specified, but no noweb sources is present" >&5
+echo "$as_me: error: --with-included-noweb specified, but no noweb sources
is present" >&2;}
+   { (exit 1); exit 1; }; }

and we have:

I suppose it is better to write:

+                yes) if test -f $axiom_optional_srcdir/noweb-2.10a.tgz ;
then

In config/var-def.mk we have:

  axiom_optional_srcdir = $(abs_top_srcdir)/zips

"with-included-noweb" implies to me that it is included, but
you expect someone to copy 'noweb-2.10a.tgz' into the Axiom
source distribution which seems awkward to me. Of course
there is no "standard" place to look for such source files
on Linux, but varies from one Linux distribution to the next
and apparently from one project to the next.

Also, note the 'noweb-2.10a.tgz' is not the current version
of noweb. See:

http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/dist

I suppose that these problems might be solved by an appropriate
configure parameter, e.g.

  --with-noweb-src=/home/bpage/noweb-2.11b.tgz

But should we be concerned about supporting different releases
of noweb if Norman Ramsey should decide to slightly change
the method of building noweb with a new release?

So in spite of the "convenience" I do not like this very much.

I would very much prefer if we simply expect developers to
resolve build dependencies in the manner that is usual for
their platform, e.g. 'apt-get build-dep axiom' on Debian.

And of course this also applies to gcl.

Do you mean that it is intended to protect the repository from
commits by Windows developers of source code containing Windows
line endings? I suppose. I never thought of it that way before.

But as a "Windows developer" I only consider it a pain that SVN
corrupts the linux sources in this manner. If I check-out code
from a "linux" project, I expect it to be valid linux source.
And the "corruption" can be subtle, for example the format of
the Axiom database files look like text files but contains byte
offsets encoded as text. These offsets are wrong if the line
endings are changed by SVN.

Windows porting tools like MSYS and the cygwin linux emulation
environment assume that source files will have unix line endings.
Even most native Windows text editors support unix line endings
as an option.

Braces like { } in the Makefile caused the make to fail.
Replacing these with ( ) worked. I have not encountered this
problem before.

I have

$ make --version
GNU Make version 3.79.1, by Richard Stallman and Roland McGrath.

Perhaps I need to upgrade it?

After reading the Common Lisp documentation here:

http://www.cs.queensu.ca/software_docs/gnudev/gcl-ansi/gcl_1130.html

It is not clear to me how I could specify something like

  C:/msys/1.0

to be added to a pathname by this method. How can I expect GCL
to know this BASE component of native Windows paths when called
from which an MSYS build environment?

Although everything else is very nice, I think the single
must significant achievement is wh-sandbox is the new algebra
bootstrap method and the removal of the Lisp from the algebra
files. In my opinion this is of great importance to the future
of Axiom.

When time permits, I would like to revisit the issue of cyclic
dependencies in the algebra files and look for evidence that
this new procedure solves the "fixed point" problem that was
never properly addressed in the old method:

Hi Gr=E9gory,

  Bootsys has a finer grained notion of types than depsys.  I
forgot about the ^=3D vs. /=3D issue -- there used to be similar issue for
when to use "eq" and "equal".

  In short: in Bootsys "^=3D" is for comparing numbers, whereas "/=3D" is
general comparison on objects.   In practice, Bootsys demands that we
have a better understanding of types in Boot programs -- depsys
has no such requirements.  All this will be much easier to work with
if and when we use typing in Boot codes.

  Patch pending.

Perhaps I am missing something, but shouldn't it be possible for the
person doing a checkout to use the svn:eol-style property flag to get
the desired behavior on a per-client basis?  In this case, perhaps that
means unix style eol for all platforms?

My point was that the the current setting is intended to work
for Windows developers -- if it causes problem we can change it.
We could try setting svn:eol-style to LF or remove this property.  
But we should check first if this gives desired consequences.
BTW:  Same files have no svn:eol-style property on them, are
they transferred as is?

AFAICS there are no properties on database files -- were they

svn should allow user control of line convertion but the documentation
leaves impression that the settings are hardwired.  I consider this
as a design (or maybe documentation) bug.  MSYS and cygwin svn
are runninig in Unix environment so should use Unix line conventions.

Could you say what is the error message and post corresponding fragment
of the build log.  The log should contain (rather longish) shell
command.  If this command is garbled, then we have make problem.
Othewise it may be some shell weirdness.

Ansi Lisp has no concept of current directory, so is of no help here
(and almost anyting about files is implementation dependent anyway).
But I think that I have reasonable solution, just the solution
depends on implementation.  For clisp, cmucl, gcl and sbcl the following
works:

(merge-pathnames "$@" (truename ""))

But Poplog clisp needs:

(merge-pathnames "$@" (truename "."))

which works incorrectly in gcl, and gives error in clisp and other
implementations may need something entirely different.

So, the full solution to relative name problem will be too large
for Makefile -- we should put it in separate portability library.

They let you set it to whatever you want.

No. I think I removed a lot of properties in particular from the 
databases (revisions 137 and 136). But that happened in trunk and not in 
build-improvements.

I know about it:

1) content of *default-pathname-defaults* is implementation dependent
2) on some implementations *default-pathname-defaults* is a relative
   path
3) on Poplog clisp:

== *default-pathname-defaults*
#P"temp.lsp"

which if you use merge-patnames nicely defaults name to "temp" and
type to "lsp".

So what?

only if set to relative path.  
But, again I don't see why that is a problem.

Having read this thread many times, it appears to me that the
whole thread is confused.

First, I think people should state clearly and unambigously what
is the problem they are trying to solve.

Second, people should state very clearly what is the problem they 
are trying to avoid with relative paths.

Yes.  As expected.  What is the real problem?

If you missed it we are trying to solve the following exercise:

Given make variables $< and $@ write a make rule which compiles
Lisp file from $< and puts the results in $@.

You can easily check that

echo '(compile-file "$<" :output-file "$@") (quit)' | ${DEPSYS}

does not work with relative paths (it works fine with absolute
paths).

Related problem is handling '--output' parameter to 'document'
script when compiling.

When I am writing about underlying problem I mean that we call
'compile-file' in Axiom and we want output in specific place
(ATM what we get is "implementation dependent").

Note that compilation is part of user interface.  We can
choose crippled interface (say only names in current directory),
accept inconsincy between Lisps or we resolve this problem in
general (for arbitrary paths).  I feel that we should resolve
the problem.

Don't you think you should forward that to comp.lang.lisp?

I just received his mail.  He could of course send the message
to comp.lang.lisp, but I also believe that he is confusing the
medium with the message.

More on that later.

I do not think it make any sense:

1) 'compile-file' works as specified -- the "only" problem is some
   aspect of specified behaviour are implementation dependent and
   impementation as doing something else compared to what we need
   (and different implementation and doing different something else).

2) We could complain about this implementation dependent behaviour
   but the problem is well-known and such message would be treated
   as an attempt to start a flame war.

3) We could ask how to archive what we want.  Again, there is a
   library (cl-fad), which solves bunch of similar exercises.
   cl-fad does not work on gcl, but it is IMHO unreasonable to
   ask a newsgroup to do a port for us.

In case you did not notice: I wrote earlier that we want to solve
inderlying problem, but in the Makefile we can arrange "$<" to
be in current directory, which solves the immediate problem.

Indeed, if you ask the newsgroup to do a port for you, it would not
make much sense.  But, again, I understood something different
from Martin's suggestion.

And many of us have been using that and building with relative paths.

Waldek claims that the various Lisps do not implement a
uniform concept of "current directory", so therefore
relative paths behave differently in different Lisps
because it is not clear what is relative to what. This
does however work as expected (i.e. in the sense of
"current directory" implemented by both Linux and Windows)
when building Axiom from build-improvements using GCL on
both Linux and Windows.

In MSYS on Windows absolute paths do to work as you might
expect, but this has anything to do with Lisp. The problem
is that MSYS is a porting environment and so there are
really two *different* concepts of absolute path: one that
applies exclusively to the MSYS environment and associated
tools, and another one that applies in the native Windows
applications. During the Axiom build we need to use both
of these because we are building Axiom and its intermediate
phases as a native apps. If we choose to use absolute paths,
as is (mostly) done in wh-sandbox, then we must be careful
when we specify paths that must be interpreted by these
native windows programs.

Alternatively when compile Axiom on MSYS using GCL, as is
done in build-improvements, we can code things carefully so
that all paths are relative and this works because the
concept of current path is the same between MSYS and native
Windows.

I do not think that resolving this problem for multiple
Lisp targets needs to be much of a priority for Axiom
right now. From my point of view it is enough that we
now have a version of the Axiom source that compiles
using GCL in ANSI mode. Being able also to compile
Axiom using other common lisps like SBCL and CLisp is
interesting but if their behaviour differs a little
because of implementation differences allowed by the
standard, I don't think that is such a big deal.

Perhaps you can convince me otherwise.

You have adequately summarized my findings while working last 
december on Axiom builds on Windows.  An important point is
to understand what MSYS/MinGW are.  From there, following
proven build techniques, one should be able to build without
much trouble.

The key to the solution, as I've found it is to code 
file manipulations in Axiom *as if* working with relative
paths.  That does not necessarily implies that everything
will be relative.  In fact, what that means is that
during the build, files are relative to the current directory
(for output files) and $AXIOM.  At installation time, we
always set $AXIOM to an absolute path, so magically everything
(after installation) becomes absolute.  

There is no need to insist that everything must be absolute
while building Axiom.  That mistake was made in what 
Axiom.build-improvements branched from.  And if I understand
Mike Thomas' work correctly (judging from what you pointed
me to), he has been trying to solve those same problems
on windows.  My claim is that we don't need to.  
Axiom.build-improvements is a "proof of concept".  Granted it
is not perfect, and there are plenty of room for improvement,
but I suspect that it provides a good starting point.


There are most (minor) issues with file manipulation in Axiom,
but I don't believe they change the problem you're trying to
solve.

If you can compile with SBCL, then you can make Axiom
compilable on Windows without requiring GCL.  That, as we have
found recently may be of importance for Axiom developers
working in windows environment.

I've read in some of the mails that 

    (in-package "boottran")

found in document.in is wrong in ANSI CL.

Why?

In Ansi Lisp string argument to in-package is case sensitive (as
all other strings).  Normal reader converts symbols to upper case.
So if you want to access boottran::boottocl

you have to write

(in-package "BOOTTRAN")
(boottocl ...)

Writing 

(in-package "boottran")
(boottocl ...)

calls |boottran|::boottocl

BTW: It is intersting to compare sbcl and GCL on:

(make-package "BOOTTRAN")
(in-package "boottran")

Apparently even Ansi GCL stil is does not handle this correctly.

Where can I find the source for the literate lisp noweb?
I'm trying to incorporate it into the release.

This change has been in Axiom.build-improvements for a long time; any
reason why it did not propagate to wh-sandbox before?

I responded to Tim privately, but I should say something on the list
too - here's the latest.

This morning I have managed to get back to a point where the notangle
operation is succeeding again on SBCL and CMUCL.  The previously
mentioned problems with running on GCL have not vanished, unfortunately
- so if this work is ever to be incorporated into Axiom we need to
either get GCL up to par or figure out how to conditionalize for GCL.

Performance wise, things look pretty good - this is the time report for
notangle on boot, interp and algebra directories running on sbcl:

Standard noweb:

Evaluation took:
  14.045 seconds of real time
  2.212138 seconds of user run time
  1.524095 seconds of system run time
  [Run times include 0.044 seconds GC run time.]
  0 calls to %EVAL
  0 page faults and
  37,579,008 bytes consed.
T

Lisp implementation:

Evaluation took:
  1.723 seconds of real time
  1.392087 seconds of user run time
  0.332021 seconds of system run time
  [Run times include 0.032 seconds GC run time.]
  0 calls to %EVAL
  0 page faults and
  39,882,408 bytes consed.
T

Which is all well and good, but the correctness does not seem to be
quite complete yet.  I ran a recursive diff on the two results with my
latest iteration - most of the differences immediately attributable are
due to a lack of an ending return character at the end of file, and I
don't know how critical that is - it can be added if need be.  There is
a great deal of whitespace difference, but filtering that out the key
remaining difficulties seem to be in some instances in the code where
line returns are not present - I don't know if they are critical to
functionality or not, and with any luck inserting the returns in the
files will cure it.  The only really serious difference that is
obviously serious is found in numtheor.spad:

diff -r -w notangle/algebra/numtheor.spad lispnt/algebra/numtheor.spad
56,59c56
<   chineseRemainder: (I,I,I,I) -> I
<     ++ \spad{chineseRemainder(x1,m1,x2,m2)} returns w, where w is
such that
<     ++ \spad{w = x1 mod m1} and \spad{w = x2 mod m2}. Note: \spad{m1}
and
<     ++ \spad{m2} must be relatively prime.
---
> <<chineseRemainder: (I,I,I,I) -> I>>
174c171
<   inverse : (I,I) -> I
---
> <<inverse : (I,I) -> I>>
483d479

I have to go back and examine that file to figure out what is going on.
 Beyond that, the literate part of the documentation needs to be fixed
to correspond to the current code structure, various parts need to be
written, and a lot of basic cleanup, testing, and other such fun jobs
remain.  I'm not quite sure if it will be ready for this next release -
it depends on how much time I can spend on it.  Being functional is a
major boost to moral, so that could help ;-).

My hunch is that with a working scanner, being able to output legal
latex files for noweb should be relatively basic (famous last words...)
in which case we would be in a position to bootstrap the pamphlet files
only from lisp.

Cheers,
CY

First, Axiom works with ANSI GCL largely due to work with other
lisps -- cmucl port by Jurgen Weiss, Greg Vanuxem sbcl work,
Gaby changes to Shoe translator.  I took subset of patches
developed for sbcl and basicaly it worked -- sbcl catched all
or almost all problems which affected ANSI GCL.

For me sbcl port is of high priority.  Some reasons:

 - Seems to work better then gcl on some targets (like Mac OSX
   or Windows)
 - There is mature code which runs on sbcl but has problems
   on gcl (like web servers)
 - sbcl compiler is much more picky then gcl so we have chance to
   clean our code
 - sbcl seem to catch more errors at runtime than gcl
 - sbcl profiler works for me, but I was unable to use gcl
   profiler
 - performance with sbcl seem to be better

For delivery on Windows I besides using gcl I consider sbcl, clisp
(may be slow but supposedly is quite stable on Windows), Poplog clisp
(the compiler does not optimize as well as sbcl, but compiles very
quickly, compiled code should beat interprters and it works on Windows),
corman (not free but licence seem to allow non-commercial binary
redistribution).

I do not give high priority to other ports (besides sbcl), but once
we have things working in sbcl it should be relatively little extra
work to support other Lisps.  And now is a logical time to do this.

I wonder why there is so much consing (and run time) here: all you
have to do in Lisp is to create a few thousends of processes.  And
most of the run time should be in system calls (system time looks
just OK for that work).  IIUC actual noweb run time contibutes to real
time, but does not show as Lisp run time, so I wonder what else
is Lisp doing.

It seems that doing the work takes similar time like creating
worker processes...

This discrepancy is in version that I posted in:

http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/axiom-developer/2007-02/msg00158.html

namely the fragment below (which searches for chunk start) assumed that
'>' can not occur in chunk name, if it is allowed one should use the
following code:

       in-chunk-start-tag-3
         (incf pos)
         (setf code (aref buff pos))
         (if (eql code end-tag-code-2)
             (go in-chunk-start-tag-4))
         (if (eql code newline-code)
             (go normal-start))
         (go in-chunk-start-tag)
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    was  (go normal)

Incidentally, the other part (which scans for <<...>> markers)
allows '>' in the name.

with work on wh-sandbox.

Most likely something about the way I set up the test was incorrect. 
FWIW, I've attached the code I'm using to run both tests.  I'm
certainly all for a fair comparison, so if I've goofed it would be good
to know.

In essense Waldek, aside from some changing of name labels and
switching to using defstruct, the functional output of the macros
should be the same as the code you posted - that's what I was shooting
for.  I'll be glad to post it in a bit but first I need to clean up the
literate part so it's not so embarrassing.

Good catch!

OK.  Was there any conclusion about whether the end-of-file line return
and white spaces pose a problem?  I wouldn't expect them to in lisp,
but perhaps SPAD isn't so forgiving.

I think content of algebra should go almost as-is to build-improvements.
ATM wh-sandbox uses different paths, but that is very easy to adjust.
I plan to add some explanations to Makefile.pamphlet (old
explanations are _very_ out of date).  Besides new bootstrap
procedure (which is contained in Makefile.pamphlet) algebra
has a namber of bug fixes and Martin's guessing package.  However,
there is some (weak) dependence on changes to interp.

HyperDoc changes are actually a few small fixes, same in interp,
some in lib, some in hyper.  In hyper Makefile.pamphlet may be
controversial:  IMO  '${HYPER}/pages/ht.db' rule in wh-sandbox
is more readible.

Let me repeat (and update) summary of main changes in wh-sandbox:

1) removal of unused code from compiler/interpreter
2) translating depsys using Shoe and removal of depsys bootstrap Lisp
3) new algebra bootstrap and removal of algebra bootstrap Lisp
4) mechanical generation of (most of) .pht pages
5) hyperdoc and algebra fixes
6) removal of useless files
7) pretty-printing of intermediate files and asq rewrite
8) adding guessing package written by Martin Rubey
9) prototype conversion in graph
10) safety/portability fixes in interp
11) making variable initialization explicit in interp

I think that main problem is merge of interp -- this is bulk of
changes and they are not entirely mechanical.  There are some
easy ones: bootstrap Lisp in c-util.boot.pamphlet and in 
interop.boot.pamphlet is unused, so this code in removed from
wh-sandbox.  OTOH Gaby converted to Shoe a bunch of files that
were earlier converted in wh-sandbox -- this created a conflict.
There were few fixes to interp files in build-improvements
revision 485 I think that I incorporated them all.  But recent
mass edits for Shoe covertion create conflicts in some files.

So there is some work to do in interp, especially due to Shoe
covertion:  my experience is that such changes while seemingly
trivial must be carefully validated, and this takes time.

There is some potential for controversion in interp/Makefile.pamphlet.
The version in wh-sandbox IMHO is simpler and has more functionality
than version in build-improvements.

I think that we can quickly agree about trivial or uncontroversial
changes (graph, algebra, some interp cleanups including removal
of bootstrap Lisp from c-util and interop).  If we agree on
design decision in interp then we will have to resolve conflicts
in recent work.

Gaby, now you should say how you imagine merge, in particular
if you object to some changes made to wh-sandbox (it looks
that you attach special importance to AX_FLAGS)?

First, I see no problem with name: since we can not use ENV changing
it to AX_FLAGS is OK.  My basic objection is that AX_FLAGS is redundant.
We already have mechanizm to propagate values to subdirectories:
we use var-def.mk.  So AX_FLAGS establishes parallel chanel,
which has significant potential for bugs and confusion.

The problem I see in writing

make AX_FLAGS

(as opposed to)

AX_FLAGS make

is that we override thing in Makefile. But we are effectively
"broadcasting" AX_FLAGS down which looks like abuse of mechanizm
designed for something else (that is allowing default in
Makfile but sometimes taking alternate values).

The second extra problem is that AX_FLAGS is new code, so may
trick potential readers to think that its use is right thing
to do.

Well, if that is the basis of your objection, then it has no foundation.
The purpose of AX_FLAGS is not to propagate values to subdirectories.

The purpose of AX_FLAGS is to propagate values to *sub-processes*, much
like MAKEFLAGS.

Until very recently, that is a very simple, reliable way of communicating
values without duplication.

That is an abuse only if you're mistaken about the purpose.

Excuse me, but that is bullshit.

I think there is no substantive difference between
"propagate to subdirectories" and "propogate to sub-
processes" since I do not know what the former expression
could mean if not the latter. It seems clear to me that
provided the information is static (i.e. determined at
configure-time) it could be communicated to sub-processes
by either mechanism.

I fail to see how either of these last comments add anything
substantial to this debate. :-( So let me try to get us past
this point.

http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Overriding
http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Override-Directive

it seems to support the notion that passing arguments to make
is intended to suport overriding of default values. I agree
that it could potentially lead to confusion because any values
of these variables set locally in the make file are ignored
unless they are explicitly coded as 'override'. And the information
about which variables these are is not available locally in the
make file but rather determined by how the make file is called.

Gaby annouced 'var-def.mk' in 'ChangeLog.build-improvements':

The GNU coding standards include conventions for Makefile
variables:

http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Makefile-Conventions.html#Mak=
efi
le-Conventions

And AX_FLAGS was introduced here:

But var-def.mk has also been extended to include axiom-specific
variables. For example in 'var-def.mk' we find:

  ## Where to find Axiom data bases.
  DAASE =3D $(axiom_src_datadir)

In  ChangeLog.build-improvements there is some evidence that
Gaby has already started to use 'var-def.mk' in the manner
suggested by Waldek:

>

I think that Waldek is claiming that all variables should be
handled this way and that passing AX_FLAGS is unnecessary, thus
permitting all make variables to potentially be overriden.

Gaby, do you see any conflict between what Waldek is suggesting
and your current approach? Or do you see AX_FLAGS as serving
some other purpose not properly addressed by 'var-def.mk'?

Bill Page.

I understand propagating to subdirectories means that Makefile in
subdirectories see the value of the variable.  Propagating to sub-processes
means that processes launched by Make either directly or recursively see the
value of the variable.  That is not the same thing.  
Granted the version of Axiom build-improvements branched from was using the
latter to simulate the former in most cases, but there is a distinction to be
made ansd config/var-def.mk was partlt created to address that.

If you define the variable only in the Makefile, you don't communicate it to
sub-processes.

Notice that if you do either of those, you are communicating variables to
sub-processes.

Before people start pulling out big words like "override" and "confusing",
they should probably look at the variables being passed in AX_FLAGS and 
elaborate on why they believe that any value set locally is ignored and why we
should not do that.

Some variables like AXIOM, DAASE, SYS, etc. need to be visible to
sub-processes (e.g. AXIOMsys), not just Make.  A "natural" way to do 
that is to declare them exported.  Ideally, I would like to see that piece of 
information declared in one place once for all.  The version of Axiom
build-improvements branched off used the ENV variable, which proved to be
problematic under some circumstances.  Then I spend trimming down the content
of that variable: many of them did not need to be exported.  They were moved
to config/var-def.mk which I also created to hold variables that should be
present in each Makefile.  At some point, in a quick hack, I used the GNU Make 
extension "export" for some variables that truly need to be exported to
sub-processes.  When testing on *BSD and solaris, I removed the use of
that extension.  At that time, I still had a hope that we could cramm the
makefiles so that it could work with several Make programs.

Please note that, at the exception of NOISE, none of the involved variable is
one that will be set by user at whim.  In fact, they are things the user
should not even know about.  I would like to eliminate NOISE.

Please, also note that just setting those variables in the Makefile is not
sufficient.  They need to be exported.

As of today, we have two variables are passed in AX_FLAGS: SYS amd NOISE.
They are all variables I would like to see them removed.  SYS, because there
ought to be a better way of communicating the information we want to pass in
and a better way to read it on the other side; NOISE, because there ought to
be better way to selectively display information, but at the current
development stage it seems like one almost always need that verbosity.
In all cases, they are *implictly* passed to sub-processes and that is
faithful to the idea that they need NOT be emphasized.

That is remarkably different from the uses of AXIOM and DAASE in the
Makefile.  They are not exported through GNU Make "export", but rather set on
the commandline that invokves the specific program they affect:  AXIOMsys.  
I also found that, just declaring AXIOM and DAASE as exported is not
sufficient; at some occasions they need to be set to different values.
Consequently, I concluded that setting them on the command line for AXIOMsys
is a better thing to do.

Please notice that I do not invoke make as

   AXIOM=...  DAASE=... make ...

because I don't think that is the appropriate thing to do.  Those variables
affect only AXIOMsys and depsys.  They are scheduled for disappearance (though
I plan communicating them through AXIOMsys options).

Why would you ever want to override SYS?

Please see above.  The only sensible thing to do (that I planeed to do but was
lowe priority) is to remove NOISE and restructrure some Boot files.
I don't think anything in AX_FLAGS needs to be potentially overriden.
I hope you see why I think AX_FLAGS should either disappear along with the
variables it communicates

ATM axiom_optional_srcdir is not available in configure, so we would

My intention is that somebody can collect Axiom and its prerequisities
and make a source distribution which should be easy to build on
large set of platforms.  Maker of such distribution can use
different noweb version with different name: changing name is
trivial (while hooking noweb build to Axiom is not so trivial).

If axiom_optional_srcdir has value other than $(abs_top_srcdir)/zips, 
then I think you must be considering a different variable.

If you ask about code I wrote the answer is no: I used arrays
of bytes (to avoid unicode overheads) and such array can not be
coerced to string.

I am open to suggestions here but I do not understand in which direction
you are heading.  

IIUC Bill was pointing out that the code I commited in two different
placed contained location of noweb sources -- that can be avoided
propagating value from configure via config/var-def.mk.

I had intended to just use $(abs_top_srcdir)/zips (without change),
but appearently Bill wants more flexibility.

Yes.  ATM wh-sandbox still exports AXIOM and DAASE, but in my experimental
database bootstrap I need different values on each interpsys invocation
(AXIOMsys is created later).

I am confused by this long message.  Does the above mean that you
agree with removal of AX_FLAGS?  Or do you consider change in NOISE
functionality a blocker?

Ideally, we should remove the zips/ directory.

If you want to add support for out of source infrastructure, I think
the natural way to do that is to use one of the --with-xxxx switch, e.g.

    --with-noweb-srcdir=/path/to/noweb/source

then you can propogate that value from within configure.

I suspect that matches what Bill wants.


I should observe that unless noweb's Makefile is supposed to stay the same
over releases, you may be heading into a quagmire

AX_FLAGS should go away only when the variables it passes to sub-processes
also go away (not just by setting them in the Makefile).  I have explained 
what that flag does.  Just setting the variables in Makefile is
no better than using AX_FLAGS which encapsulates them.  
SYS is snicky but not hard.  NOISE needs more restructing, but is lower
priority for me.

Please copy the list. 

Just send updates as you get them. I read the document you gave me at
ECCAD and built the literate version you sent. I still have about 30
more iterations of Axiom builds before I've run merged and tested the
current queued changes so it will be a while yet.

I'm looking at a version that will run under GCL but keeping your
original for the future ANSI version. I want to set up one file
in the next release that builds using a version of clweb so we
can experiment.

We can use Beebe's bibtex file. Tell me what bibtex commands
you'd like to have happen with clweb, what files are involved,
and I'll put it into the build.

Thanks!  By my estimate in another day or two I will have a version I'm
willing to post to the list.

OK.

OK.  That will require the other half of noweb - translation to valid
LaTeX.  Hmm.  Letssee...

The latex part is nothing fancy:

latex cl-web-v0.5.lisp.tex
bibtex cl-web-v0.5.lisp
latex cl-web-v0.5.lisp.tex
latex cl-web-v0.5.lisp.tex

The files needed are:
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/litprog.bib
and a required style file:
http://www.math.utah.edu/pub/tex/bib/bibnames.sty

The former is explicitly public domain, the latter has no license or
copyright statement at all - I doubt it would be a problem to use it
but I should drop him an email to be sure.  I'm currently using a test
bst file but I'll switch it over to the plain one - no point in
tackling too many issues at once.

That's a point, actually - is there a bibtex style file that folks
would regard as the "best" style to use for Axiom pamphlets?

The graphic for the finite state diagram I suspect needs to remain in
postscript format, as we don't want to add graphviz to the build
requirements.  I'm not quite sure how to handle that - perhaps include
the dot source as an appendix?

The command, for the record, is:

dot -Tps -o finite-state-tangle.ps finite-state-tangle.dot

I'd still like to find some way of organizing the bibliography so it is
viewable by category, but doing so is highly non-trivial.  The primary
difficulty with not doing so is finding a way to quickly answer the
questions "does Axiom's bibliography already have this paper in it" and
"if it does, what is the string I use to cite it?"  I suppose that's a
problem for an editor more than anything - my admittedly crude attempt
to create a system for divvying up the file by PACS and MSC2000
classifications is probably insufficient to cover all the needed
categories, and the ACM Computing Classification System (1998) is
copyrighted with usage terms that clearly would require specific
permission to use it in something like this.  (MSC2000 and PACS don't
seem to say much about it one way or the other.)  What we probably need
in reality is an editor that allows convenient and fast searching of a
very large bibliography by keyword/author/title/etc.

This topic died back a while ago as very little truly literate work has
been going on, but now that it's come up again can anyone recommend
tools for dealing efficiently with very large bibliographies?

Cheers,
CY
